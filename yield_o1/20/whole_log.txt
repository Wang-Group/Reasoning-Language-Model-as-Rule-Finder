Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* lacks clarity due to inconsistent supporting examples. The rule specifies amino groups at the gamma (γ) position, but one supporting example, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, contains a sulfanyl group instead of an amino group. This inconsistency reduces clarity and suggests insufficient coverage. The property insight is reasonable but undermined by the mismatched example. The rule needs refinement for better clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* is clear and specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position lead to high yield. The property insight about electron-withdrawing groups stabilizing intermediates is sound. Complexity is moderate, involving both structural and electronic considerations. Coverage is adequate, supported by two high-yield examples (**4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**), meeting the criteria well.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* is clear in its structural description but has conflicting data. While the rule predicts high yield for modifiers with amino or pyridine groups capable of metal coordination, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** is listed as low yield in the dataset, contradicting the rule. This inconsistency affects clarity and coverage. The property insight is valid, but the rule may require refinement to account for exceptions.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* is clear but lacks sufficient coverage. It states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with eight-carbon chains and no additional functional groups lead to high yield. The only supporting example is **octanoic acid** (True), providing limited data support. The property insight is minimal, and the rule's simplicity reduces complexity. More data points are needed to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* is clear and well-supported. It specifies that heavily fluorinated aliphatic acids lead to low yield, with good property insight into the effects of electronegative fluorine atoms. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is adequate, supported by two low-yield examples (**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**), satisfying the criteria.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* is clear and provides reasonable property insight about the ineffective interaction of distant amino groups. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is sufficient, supported by two low-yield examples (**7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**). The rule meets the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* is clear and offers good property insight regarding additional carboxyl groups aiding metal coordination. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is adequate with two supportive examples (**(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**, **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**). The rule meets the criteria well.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* lacks adequate coverage. It states that amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lead to low yield, but only **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine) is provided as a supporting example. The rule is clear, but property insight is limited, and more data points are needed to strengthen it.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* is clear but has limited coverage, with only one low-yield example (**7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**). The property insight about polar hydroxyl groups on long chains impeding reactivity is reasonable. Complexity is moderate, but the rule requires more data support to be reliable.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* is clear and provides solid property insight into chelation stabilizing the catalyst. Complexity is higher due to consideration of multiple donor atoms. Coverage is adequate, supported by two high-yield examples (**(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**). The rule meets the criteria effectively.

Property insight is minimal, and coverage is inadequate, weakening the rule.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* is clear but lacks coverage, supported by only one low-yield example (**4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**). The property insight about thiol groups deactivating the catalyst is reasonable. Complexity is moderate, but additional data points are necessary for reliability.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* is clear with reasonable property insight into heterocycles enhancing reactivity. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is adequate, supported by two high-yield examples (**1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**). The rule meets the criteria effectively.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 1** to address the inconsistency in supporting examples. Since **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** contains a sulfanyl (–SH) group instead of an amino (–NH₂) group at the gamma (γ) position but still leads to high yield, consider modifying the rule to include other nucleophilic groups. Update the rule to: "**Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a nucleophilic group (e.g., amino, sulfanyl) at the gamma (γ) position lead to high yield.**" This refinement improves clarity and coverage by encompassing similar functional groups that have shown high yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Address the inconsistency in Rule 3** regarding **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, which is listed as low yield in the dataset but used as a high-yield example. Verify the yield data for this compound. If it indeed gives low yield, adjust the rule to account for exceptions or specify additional structural requirements. For instance, refine the rule to: "**Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with amino or pyridine groups capable of coordinating to metal centers, without steric hindrance or deactivating substituents, lead to high yield.**" This adjustment enhances clarity and aligns the rule with the observed data.

- **Advice 3**: **Expand the coverage of Rule 4** by including more supporting examples or reconsidering its generality. Since only **octanoic acid** is provided as a high-yield example, investigate other aliphatic carboxylic acids with similar chain lengths to determine if they also result in high yield. If additional examples are lacking, consider merging this rule with others that focus on aliphatic chain effects, or adjust the rule to reflect any new findings. This will improve the rule's robustness and data support.

- **Advice 4**: **Enhance Rule 8** by adding more supporting examples to strengthen its coverage. Currently, only **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** supports the rule that amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lead to low yield. Search for additional data on similar amino acids, such as tyrosine or tryptophan derivatives, to confirm if they also result in low yield. This will increase the reliability and applicability of the rule.

- **Advice 5**: **Supplement Rule 9** with additional examples to improve coverage. The rule currently relies on **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** as the sole low-yield example. Investigate other aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups on long chains (seven or more carbons) to see if they also produce low yield. Including more data points will enhance the rule's validity and predictive power.

- **Advice 6**: **Provide more data for Rule 12** or consider merging it with related rules. With only **4-formylbenzoic acid** as a supporting example, the rule lacks sufficient coverage. Look for additional modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic rings that lead to low yield. Alternatively, combine this rule with **Rule 2**, which deals with substituents on aromatic rings affecting yield, to create a more comprehensive rule about the impact of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups.

- **Advice 7**: **Refine Rule 13** for clarity and support. The rule currently depends on a single example, **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**. Specify the structural features more precisely, such as the position of methoxy groups and the length of aliphatic chains. Seek additional examples with similar structures that result in high yield to validate the rule. This will improve clarity and ensure the rule is well-supported by data.

- **Advice 8**: **Strengthen Rule 14** by acquiring more supporting examples. With only **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** as evidence, the rule's coverage is insufficient. Identify other aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly attached to the ring that result in low yield. Additional data will bolster the rule's reliability and help determine if the observed effect is consistent across similar compounds.

- **Advice 9**: **Consolidate overlapping rules to improve the ruleset's efficiency and clarity**. For example, consider combining **Rule 2** (electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings leading to high yield) and **Rule 12** (aldehyde or ketone groups on aromatic rings leading to low yield) into a broader rule that accounts for the electronic effects of various substituents on aromatic rings. This unified rule can specify how different functional groups influence yield based on their electron-donating or electron-withdrawing characteristics.

- **Advice 10**: **Verify data accuracy for compounds with conflicting information**. Double-check the yield values for compounds like **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** to resolve discrepancies between the dataset and the supporting examples in the rules. Ensuring data accuracy is crucial for developing reliable rules. If necessary, update the dataset or adjust the rules to reflect the correct information.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  *Rule 1* is clear and specifies that modifiers which are carboxylic acids with amino groups (–NH₂) at the beta (β) or gamma (γ) position lead to high yield. The rule is well-supported by multiple data points with high yield—specifically entries 0 [(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid], 2 [(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid], and 3 [5-aminopentanoic acid]. It correctly distinguishes low-yield modifiers like entries 31 [7-aminoheptanoic acid] and 34 [8-aminooctanoic acid], where the amino group is further away. The property insight is strong, explaining the enhanced coordination with metal centers due to proximal amino groups. The rule balances complexity and coverage effectively, considering a combination of functional groups and their positions.

- **Comment 2**:

  *Rule 2* states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position lead to high yield. This rule is clear and supported by data points like entry 1 [4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid] and entry 20 [4-nitrobenzoic acid], both yielding high. However, entry 19 [4-formylbenzoic acid] yields low, despite having an electron-withdrawing group. The rule notes this exception, attributing it to potential interference from aldehyde groups. The property insight is adequate, but the rule could be refined to exclude specific substituents that adversely affect the reaction. Coverage is acceptable with multiple supporting examples, and the balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 3**:

  *Rule 3* describes that modifiers which are aromatic carboxylic acids with amino or pyridine groups capable of coordinating to metal centers lead to high yield. The rule is clear and well-supported by high-yield data points—entry 4 [4-aminobenzoic acid], entry 16 [1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid], and entry 21 [pyridine-3-carboxylic acid]. The low-yield example, entry 12 [4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid], is acknowledged, possibly due to steric hindrance or electronic effects. The property insight is strong, emphasizing the role of coordinating groups in enhancing catalyst activity. The rule effectively combines functional group presence with their coordination ability, showing good complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**:

  *Rule 4* posits that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (eight carbons or more) without additional functional groups lead to high yield. The rule is clear but has limited support, primarily from entry 5 [octanoic acid], which shows high yield. However, there are no additional data points of similar modifiers to reinforce the rule. The property insight is reasonable, suggesting favorable interactions with the catalyst surface. The rule's complexity is low, focusing on chain length without considering other structural factors. Coverage is minimal, reducing the rule's reliability. Balancing complexity and coverage could be improved by including more supporting examples or expanding the rule's scope.

- **Comment 5**:

  *Rule 5* states that heavily fluorinated aliphatic acids lead to low yield. This rule is clear and supported by entries 14 [2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid] and 28 [4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid], both yielding low. The property insight is solid, highlighting how electronegative fluorine atoms can disrupt catalyst interactions. The rule has acceptable complexity, focusing on a specific chemical modification. Coverage meets the minimum criteria, though more data points would strengthen it. The balance between specificity and coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 6**:

  *Rule 6* notes that modifiers containing ethylene glycol chains (–O–CH₂–CH₂–O– units) lead to low yield. The rule is clear and supported by entries 11 [2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid] and 32 [3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid], both showing low yield. The property insight is acceptable, suggesting that flexible chains may adversely affect catalyst interaction. Complexity is appropriate, considering specific functional groups within the modifier. Coverage is minimal but sufficient per criteria. The rule is balanced in complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**:

Coverage is acceptable, with at least two supporting examples. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**:

  *Rule 8* indicates that amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lead to low yield. The rule is clear and supported by entry 13 [(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)], which shows low yield. However, coverage is limited to a single data point. While the property insight regarding steric hindrance is valid, the rule lacks sufficient supporting examples to confirm its general applicability. Complexity is moderate, considering both amino acid structure and side chain characteristics. The balance between complexity and coverage could be improved by identifying more data points.

- **Comment 9**:

  *Rule 9* states that aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (–SH) groups attached directly to the ring lead to low yield.

The rule is clear, with solid property insight into the importance of chain length and functional groups. Complexity is reasonable, combining chain length with specific substituents. Coverage is acceptable, and the rule balances complexity and coverage well.

- **Comment 11**:

  *Rule 11* indicates that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield. This rule is clear and supported by entries 19 [4-formylbenzoic acid] and 27 [4-oxoheptanedioic acid], both yielding low. The property insight is acceptable, suggesting that carbonyl groups may interfere with the catalyst or reaction mechanism. Complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific functional groups. Coverage meets the minimum criteria. The rule is balanced in terms of complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 12**:

  *Rule 12* states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the delta (δ) or further positions lead to low yield. This rule is clear and supported by entries 31 [7-aminoheptanoic acid] and 34 [8-aminooctanoic acid], both yielding low. The property insight is sound, noting that distant amino groups may not effectively interact with the catalyst. Complexity is reasonable, considering both functional groups and their positions. Coverage is acceptable, and the rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 13**:

  *Rule 13* asserts that cyclic carboxylic acids containing heteroatoms capable of coordinating to metals lead to high yield. The rule is clear and supported by entries 8 [2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid], 16 [1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid], and 21 [pyridine-3-carboxylic acid], all yielding high. The property insight is strong, emphasizing the role of heterocyclic compounds in coordination. Complexity is high, considering specific ring structures and functional groups. Coverage is good, and the rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 14**:

  *Rule 14* states that modifiers containing sulfur-containing amino acids or derivatives lead to low yield. This rule is clear and supported by entry 23 [2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid], which yields low. The property insight is strong, indicating that sulfur groups may deactivate the catalyst. Complexity is acceptable, focusing on specific amino acid derivatives. Coverage is limited to one data point, which weakens the rule's reliability. Balancing complexity and coverage could be improved by identifying additional examples.

- **Comment 15**:

  *Rule 15* suggests that sugar acids or sugar derivatives with multiple hydroxyl groups attached to a carboxylic acid lead to high yield. The rule is clear and supported by entry 9 [(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid], which yields high. The property insight is reasonable, noting enhanced solubility and catalyst interaction due to multiple hydroxyl groups. Complexity is moderate, focusing on specific structural features. Coverage is minimal with only one data point, reducing confidence in the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage could be enhanced by including more supporting examples.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise Rule 1 SMARTS Pattern to Include Both Beta and Gamma Positions**

  The current SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 (`'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`) only matches amino groups that are exactly three carbons away from the carboxylic acid group (gamma position). To accurately reflect the rule, which includes both beta (two carbons away) and gamma positions, the pattern should be modified to include a variable number of carbon atoms between the amino group and the carboxylic acid. Consider using:

  - Updated Pattern: `'[NX3H2][CX4]([CX4])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`
  
  This pattern matches molecules where the amino group is connected via either one or two carbon atoms to the carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct Rule 2 SMARTS Pattern for Para-Substituted Aromatic Carboxylic Acids**

  The current pattern for Rule 2 (`'[c][c](F,Cl,Br,I,N(=O)=O)[c][c][c][C](=O)[O,H]'`) seems to misrepresent the para-substitution pattern and the electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). Modify the pattern to accurately capture para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with EWGs:

  - Updated Pattern: `'c1cc([F,Cl,Br,I,$(N(=O)=O)])ccc1C(=O)[OX2H1]'`
  
  This pattern ensures that the EWG is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Enhance Rule 3 SMARTS Pattern to Include Pyridine Rings**

  The existing pattern for Rule 3 (`'c1ccc([nH2,nH,n])cc1C(=O)[O,H]'`) may not capture pyridine-containing compounds adequately. Modify the pattern to include heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating to metals:

  - Updated Pattern: `'[cH]1[cH][cH][n][cH][cH]1C(=O)[OX2H1]'`
  
  Alternatively, to generalize:
  
  - Updated Pattern: `'c1nccc([cH])c1C(=O)[OX2H1]'`
  
  This pattern captures pyridine rings with a carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Adjust Rule 4 Pattern to Match Long-Chain Aliphatic Acids Correctly**

  The pattern for Rule 4 (`'C(=O)[O,H][CH2]{7,}'`) may not match molecules where the carboxylic acid is at the end of a long aliphatic chain (eight carbons or more). Revise the pattern to include the chain length correctly:

  - Updated Pattern: `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH3]'`
  
  This pattern represents an eight-carbon chain terminating in a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Refine Rule 5 Pattern for Heavily Fluorinated Aliphatic Acids**

  The current pattern (`'C(=O)[O,H][C,F]([F])([F])[C,F]'`) may not capture all heavily fluorinated aliphatic acids. Modify the pattern to detect multiple fluorine atoms on the aliphatic chain:

  - Updated Pattern: `'C(=O)[OX1H1][CX4]([FX1])([FX1])[CX4][FX1]'`
  
  This pattern matches a carboxylic acid attached to a carbon with multiple fluorine atoms.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Ensure Rule 6 Pattern Specifically Matches Ethylene Glycol Units**

  The pattern for Rule 6 (`'[OX2][CH2][CH2][OX2]'`) may generate false positives. Specify that the ethylene glycol unit is part of the modifier:

  - Updated Pattern: `'[OX2H][CH2][CH2][OX2H]'`
  
  This pattern emphasizes that both oxygen atoms are hydroxyl groups, matching ethylene glycol chains.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Update Rule 7 Pattern to Match Amino Acids with Acidic Side Chains**

  The current pattern (`'[NX3H2][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`) may not fully represent amino acids with additional carboxyl groups on the side chain. Modify the pattern:

  - Updated Pattern: `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`
  
  This pattern matches amino acids with side chains containing carboxyl groups, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Revise Rule 8 Pattern for Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains**

  The existing pattern (`'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][c]'`) may not encompass all relevant amino acids. Modify the pattern to include aromatic side chains more generally:

  - Updated Pattern: `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1][CX4][c]'`
  
  This pattern matches amino acids like phenylalanine, where the aromatic ring is part of the side chain.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Correct Rule 9 Pattern to Accurately Identify Aromatic Thiols**

  The pattern (`'[c][SX2H]'`) may not match thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings with a carboxylic acid group. Improve the pattern:

  - Updated Pattern: `'c1cc([SX2H])ccc1C(=O)[OX2H1]'`
  
  This pattern targets aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly attached to the ring.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Modify Rule 10 Pattern to Include Extended Aliphatic Chains**

  The current pattern (`'[c][C][C][C][OX2H,OX2][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`) may be too restrictive. Adjust it to allow varying chain lengths:

  - Updated Pattern: `'c1ccc(cc1)[CX4][CX4][CX4][OX2H,OX2][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`
  
  This pattern captures an aromatic ring connected to an extended aliphatic chain with hydroxy or methoxy groups and terminating with a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Ensure Rule 11 Pattern Matches Aldehyde or Ketone Groups on Aromatics**

  The pattern (`'[c][CX3H0](=O)[#6]'`) may not match all relevant structures. Revise it for accuracy:

  - Updated Pattern: `'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[#6])cc1'`
  
  This pattern matches aromatic rings with aldehyde or ketone groups attached.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Revise Rule 12 Pattern for Amino Groups at Delta Position or Beyond**

  The current pattern (`'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`) may not fully capture amino groups four or more carbons from the carboxyl group. Modify it to include longer chains:

  - Updated Pattern: `'[NX3H2][CX4]([CX4])[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`
  
  This pattern matches molecules with amino groups at the delta position or further away.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Enhance Rule 13 Pattern to Include Various Heterocyclic Rings**

  The existing pattern (`'c1nccc1C(=O)[O,H]'`) may be too specific. Broaden the pattern to include different heterocycles:

  - Updated Pattern: `'c1n[cH]cn1C(=O)[OX2H1]'`
  
  Alternatively, use a more general pattern:

  - Updated Pattern: `'[cH]1[n,o,s][cH][cH][cH][cH]1C(=O)[OX2H1]'`
  
  This approach captures various heterocyclic carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Adjust Rule 14 Pattern for Sulfur-Containing Amino Acids**

  The pattern (`'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][SX2][CX4]'`) might not match all sulfur-containing amino acids. Modify it for precise matching:

  - Updated Pattern: `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][CX4][SX2][CX4]'`
  
  This pattern includes sulfur atoms within the side chain at appropriate positions.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Refine Rule 15 Pattern for Sugar Acids with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups**

  The current pattern (`'[CX4]([OX2H])[OX2H][CX4]([OX2H])[OX2H][CX4](=O)[OX1H1]'`) may not capture the entire sugar backbone. Update the pattern:

  - Updated Pattern: `'[CX4]([OX2H])([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[OX2H][CX4](=O)[OX1H1]'`
  
  This pattern represents sugar acids with multiple hydroxyl groups leading to a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 16**: **Ensure Proper Compilation and Error Handling in the Code**

  Add error handling for SMARTS pattern compilation to catch and report any invalid patterns. For example:

  ```python
  for rule in rules:
      try:
          rule['compiled_pattern'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts(rule['pattern'])
          if rule['compiled_pattern'] is None:
              print(f"Error compiling pattern for Rule {rule['number']}: '{rule['pattern']}'")
      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Exception compiling pattern for Rule {rule['number']}: {e}")
          rule['compiled_pattern'] = None
  ```

- **Suggestion 17**: **Include Aromaticity and Tautomeric Considerations**

  Ensure that the SMILES parsing considers aromaticity and possible tautomeric forms, which might affect substructure matching.

- **Suggestion 18**: **Test Patterns Individually with Known Compounds**

  Before applying the patterns to the entire dataset, test each SMARTS pattern with known compounds (both positive and negative examples) to validate their accuracy.

- **Suggestion 19**: **Use Recursive SMARTS or Logical Operators for Complex Patterns**

  For rules requiring complex pattern matching, utilize recursive SMARTS or logical operators to capture the structural nuances accurately.

- **Suggestion 20**: **Document Patterns Within the Code for Clarity**

  Add comments or documentation within the code explaining each SMARTS pattern to improve readability and maintainability.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Transform Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Structural Features**

  - *Explanation*: Convert the current qualitative rules into specific structural features that can be numerically encoded. For example, create binary or count features for the presence of amino groups, carboxyl groups, aromatic rings, electron-withdrawing groups, chain lengths, and heteroatoms.

  - *Implementation*:
    - Encode functional groups as binary variables (1 if present, 0 if absent).
    - Quantify chain lengths by counting the number of carbons in aliphatic chains.
    - Assign numerical values to the positions of functional groups relative to the carboxylic acid group (e.g., alpha = 1, beta = 2, gamma = 3, etc.).

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints for Feature Generation**

  - *Explanation*: Use cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit, ChemAxon) to calculate molecular descriptors and fingerprints for each modifier. These descriptors numerically represent molecular properties and can serve as features for modeling.

  - *Implementation*:
    - Calculate descriptors such as molecular weight, LogP, topological polar surface area (TPSA), hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and rotatable bonds.
    - Generate structural fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) to capture substructure information.

- **Advice 3**: **Simplify and Generalize Rules to Reduce Complexity**

  - *Explanation*: Review the current rules to identify and eliminate redundancy or overly specific conditions. Simplify rules by focusing on key functional groups and structural motifs that significantly impact yield.

  - *Implementation*:
    - Merge rules that address similar structural features (e.g., combine Rules 1 and 7 regarding amino acids with additional carboxyl groups).
    - Remove exceptions unless strongly supported by data.
    - Focus on broad categories like "presence of coordinating groups" or "length of aliphatic chains."

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Modeling**

  - *Explanation*: Apply QSAR techniques to correlate molecular descriptors with reaction yield quantitatively. This statistical modeling approach can identify the most relevant features affecting the yield.

  - *Implementation*:
    - Use regression or classification algorithms to build predictive models.
    - Perform feature selection to identify descriptors with the highest correlation to yield.
    - Validate models using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness.

- **Advice 5**: **Define Numerical Thresholds for Key Structural Features**

  - *Explanation*: Establish numerical cutoffs for features like chain length, distance of functional groups, and electronic effects to facilitate numerical encoding and feature matrix generation.

  - *Implementation*:
    - Set thresholds (e.g., chain length ≥ 8 carbons leads to high yield).
    - Quantify electronic effects using parameters like Hammett sigma constants for substituents.
    - Use distance counts for functional group positions relative to the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 6**: **Prioritize Easily Measurable and Relevant Molecular Properties**

  - *Explanation*: Focus on molecular properties that are both impactful on yield and straightforward to calculate or measure. This approach enhances the practicality of feature generation.

  - *Implementation*:
    - Emphasize properties like hydrophobicity (LogP), hydrogen bonding capacity, and molecular size.
    - Avoid features that are difficult to quantify or have minimal impact on yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Apply Statistical Analysis to Refine Rule Significance**

  - *Explanation*: Use statistical methods to assess the significance of each rule and feature. This analysis can highlight which rules are most predictive and should be retained or adjusted.

  - *Implementation*:
    - Calculate p-values or confidence intervals for the correlation between features and yield.
    - Use techniques like chi-square tests for categorical features or ANOVA for continuous features.
    - Retain rules with strong statistical support and revise or discard weaker ones.

- **Advice 8**: **Consider Electronic and Steric Effects in Numerical Form**

  - *Explanation*: Quantify electronic effects (e.g., electron-donating or withdrawing capacity) and steric hindrance to include in the feature matrix.

  - *Implementation*:
    - Assign numerical values to substituents based on their electron-withdrawing/donating strength.
    - Use steric parameters like Taft steric constants.
    - Incorporate these values into the descriptor set for modeling.

- **Advice 9**: **Integrate Multivariate Techniques to Identify Hidden Patterns**

  - *Explanation*: Use multivariate statistical methods like principal component analysis (PCA) to uncover underlying patterns in the data that may not be evident from individual rules.

  - *Implementation*:
    - Perform PCA on the molecular descriptors to reduce dimensionality and identify key factors.
    - Use cluster analysis to group modifiers with similar properties and yields.
    - Adjust rules based on insights gained from these analyses.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Iterate on the Improved Rules with Expanded Data**

  - *Explanation*: Test the revised rules on additional modifiers not included in the original dataset to assess their predictive power and generalizability.

  - *Implementation*:
    - Gather more experimental data or use existing databases to find additional examples.
    - Apply the improved rules to predict yields for these new modifiers.
    - Adjust rules as necessary based on validation results to enhance their accuracy.

      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(True)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with functionalized aliphatic side chains containing hydroxy (–OH) or methoxy (–OCH₃) groups, especially when the chain is extended (three carbons or more), lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: The extended side chain allows the functional group to interact effectively with the catalyst, and polar groups enhance solubility and binding affinity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid *(True)*
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid *(True)*

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with amino groups (–NH₂) at the beta (β) or gamma (γ) position (within three carbons of the carboxyl group) lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group allows effective chelation with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity and stabilizing intermediates.
  - *Supporting Examples*: 
    - **High Yield**: 
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid *(True)*
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(True)*
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(False)*
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position lead to high yield, unless the group interferes with metal coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group and can facilitate stronger interactions with the catalyst's metal centers.
  - *Supporting Examples*: 
    - **High Yield**:
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid *(True)*
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid *(False)* *(The aldehyde may form unfavorable interactions or chelate the metal center differently.)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of coordinating to metal centers (e.g., amino (–NH₂), hydroxy (–OH), pyridinyl nitrogen) directly attached to the ring lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: These groups provide additional coordination sites, strengthening binding to the catalyst and enhancing catalytic activity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid *(True)*
      - pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(True)*
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid *(False)* *(Methyl groups do not coordinate with metal centers.)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with non-coordinating electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl (–CH₃)) at the para position lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups without coordinating ability may reduce the acidity of the carboxyl group and weaken interactions with the metal catalyst.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a chain length of six carbons or more and no additional functional groups lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Longer hydrophobic chains can favor interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing adsorption without introducing steric hindrance or electronic interference.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - Octanoic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid *(False)* *(The hydroxy group may interfere with optimal binding.)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether chains, such as ethylene glycol units (–O–CH₂–CH₂–O–), lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Flexible ether chains may prevent optimal positioning of the functional groups for effective interaction with the catalyst, reducing activity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid *(False)*
      - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains (additional carboxyl groups) lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Extra carboxyl groups can enhance chelation with metal centers, increasing catalyst stability and reactivity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(Aspartic acid, True)*
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(Glutamic acid, True)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains lead to variable yield depending on the sulfur's ability to coordinate; methionine derivatives lead to low yield, while thiol-containing modifiers may lead to high yield if the thiol is not directly attached to an aromatic ring.**

  - *Explanation*: Sulfur atoms can coordinate with metal centers, but steric and electronic factors affect this interaction. Free thiol groups (–SH) can act as good ligands if appropriately positioned.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid *(True)* *(Thiol is accessible for coordination.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid *(False)* *(Methionine derivative where sulfur is less available for coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups attached directly to the ring lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxyl group for coordination sites on the catalyst or form inactive complexes, reducing catalytic efficiency.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid *(False)*
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid *(Despite being a cyclic ketone, the carbonyl groups may interfere; however, note that this example was actually reported as high yield, so exceptions may exist.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heteroatoms capable of coordinating with metal centers lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as strong ligands, enhancing coordination with the catalyst's metal centers and promoting reactivity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(True)*
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid *(True)*
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(False)* *(Possible steric hindrance or lack of effective coordination due to the substituent's position.)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aliphatic amino groups at the delta (δ) position or further from the carboxyl group (four or more carbons away) lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Distant amino groups may not effectively participate in coordination with the catalyst, reducing their positive impact on yield.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(False)*
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with fluorinated aliphatic chains lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms can create strong electron-withdrawing effects, destabilizing interactions with the catalyst and possibly leading to unfavorable binding.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid *(False)*
      - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are sugar acids or sugar derivatives with multiple hydroxyl groups attached to a carboxylic acid lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and provide additional hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst, potentially stabilizing reactive intermediates.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(True)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with functionalized aliphatic side chains containing hydroxy (–OH) or methoxy (–OCH₃) groups, especially when the chain is extended (three carbons or more), lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: The extended side chain allows the functional group to interact effectively with the catalyst, and polar groups enhance solubility and binding affinity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid *(True)*
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid *(False)* *(Shorter chain may limit effective interaction.)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing flexible chains with ether linkages (e.g., ethylene glycol units) lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Such flexible chains may not hold functional groups in the optimal position for catalyst interaction and could introduce conformational dynamics that reduce binding efficiency.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid *(False)*
      - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid *(False)*

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **For Rule 2**, the current code does not correctly identify electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) attached directly to the para position of the aromatic ring. Modify the code to specifically check whether the para position atom has a direct substituent that matches the EWG pattern. Here's how you can adjust the code:

  ```python

          matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(aromatic_c_acid)
          if matches:
              # Define EWG SMARTS pattern
              ewg = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[$([F,Cl,Br,I]),$([N+](=O)[O-])]')

              for match in matches:
                  para_atom_idx = match[3]  # Correct index for para position
                  para_atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(para_atom_idx)
                  # Check if the para atom has a substituent matching EWG
                  for bond in para_atom.GetBonds():
                      neighbor = bond.GetOtherAtom(para_atom)
                      if neighbor.GetIdx() not in match:
                          if neighbor.HasSubstructMatch(ewg):
                              return 1
              return 0
          return 0
      except:
          return 0
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: **For Rule 3**, the code currently checks for nitrogen or oxygen atoms anywhere in the molecule, not specifically attached to the aromatic ring. Modify the code to identify coordinating functional groups (e.g., –NH₂, –OH) directly attached to the ring carbons:

  ```python
  def rule3(mol):
      try:
          aromatic_c_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc([C](=O)[O;H1])cc1')
          matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(aromatic_c_acid)
          if matches:
              coordinating_group = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3H2,OX2H]')
              ring_atoms = set()
              for match in matches:
                  ring_atoms.update(match[:6])  # First six atoms are the ring
              for atom_idx in ring_atoms:
                  atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(atom_idx)
                  for neighbor in atom.GetNeighbors():
                      if neighbor.GetIdx() not in ring_atoms:
                          if neighbor.HasSubstructMatch(coordinating_group):
                              return 1
              return 0
          return 0
      except:
          return 0
  ```

- **Suggestion 3**: **For Rule 4**, the code incorrectly checks for any carbon atom instead of a methyl group attached at the para position. Update the code to specifically detect a methyl group at the para position:

  ```python
  def rule4(mol):
      try:
          aromatic_c_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc([C](=O)[O;H1])cc1')
          matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(aromatic_c_acid)
          if matches:
              methyl = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CH3]')
              for match in matches:
                  para_atom_idx = match[3]
                  para_atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(para_atom_idx)
                  for bond in para_atom.GetBonds():
                      neighbor = bond.GetOtherAtom(para_atom)
                      if neighbor.GetIdx() not in match:
                          if neighbor.HasSubstructMatch(methyl):
                              return -1
              return 0
          return 0
      except:
          return 0
  ```

- **Suggestion 4**: **For Rule 5**, the SMARTS pattern is too specific and may miss valid molecules. Generalize the pattern to match any aliphatic chain of six or more carbons ending with a carboxylic acid:

  ```python
  def rule5(mol):
      try:
          # Match aliphatic carboxylic acid with chain length ≥6
          pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CH3][CH2]{4,}[CH2][C](=O)[O;H1]')
          if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern):
              fg = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[!#6;!#1]')
              if not mol.HasSubstructMatch(fg):
                  return 1
          return 0
      except:
          return 0
  ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **For Rule 6 and Rule 15**, both rules aim to capture modifiers containing flexible ether chains but are treated separately. Combine them to avoid redundancy and ensure consistency in detecting ether linkages:

  ```python
  def rule6_and_15(mol):
      try:
          ether_linkage = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[OD2]([#6])[#6]')
          if mol.HasSubstructMatch(ether_linkage):
              return -1
          return 0
      except:
          return 0
  ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **For Rule 8**, the code needs clarity on handling the 'variable' prediction. Since methionine derivatives lead to low yield and thiol-containing modifiers may lead to high yield, split the rule into two separate functions for clarity:

  ```python
  def rule8a(mol):
      # Methionine derivatives leading to low yield
      try:
          methionine_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts('CSCC[C@H](N)C(=O)O')
          if mol.HasSubstructMatch(methionine_pattern):
              return -1
          return 0
      except:
          return 0

  def rule8b(mol):
      # Thiol-containing modifiers leading to high yield
      try:
          thiol = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX4][SX1H]')
          if mol.HasSubstructMatch(thiol):
              return 1
          return 0
      except:
          return 0
  ```

- **Suggestion 7**: **For positional checks in all rules (e.g., para position in aromatic rings)**, ensure the code accurately identifies substituents at specific positions by correctly mapping atom indices and using precise SMARTS patterns for positions.

- **Suggestion 8**: **For all SMARTS patterns**, use well-defined and specific SMARTS that represent the intended functional groups precisely. This reduces false positives/negatives and improves the accuracy of substructure searches.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Implement Unit Tests** for each rule function using known molecules (both positive and negative examples) to verify that the code behaves as expected.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Metrics Compared to Reference Metrics**

Thank you for providing the current rule metrics and the reference metrics from previous iterations. Below is a detailed analysis focusing on confidence and lift, along with comments on how to improve the current rules.

---

**1. Comparison of Metrics**

**a. Support**

- **Current Train Support:** 0.0514
- **Previous Train Support:** [0.1667, 0.1845]

*Interpretation:* The current support is significantly lower than the previous averages. This means that the current set of rules applies to approximately 5.14% of the training data, whereas previous rules applied to around 16.67% to 18.45% of the data.

**b. Confidence**

- **Current Train Confidence:** 0.7114
- **Previous Train Confidence:** [0.6352, 0.5396]

*Interpretation:* The current confidence is higher than the previous averages. A confidence of 71.14% indicates that when the rule conditions are met, there is a 71.14% chance that the prediction (e.g., high yield) is correct. This is an improvement over previous confidences of approximately 63.52% and 53.96%.

**c. Lift**

- **Current Train Lift:** 1.4199
- **Previous Train Lift:** [1.2048, 1.0559]

*Interpretation:* The current lift is noticeably higher than the previous values. A lift of 1.4199 suggests that the rules are 41.99% better at predicting the outcome compared to random chance, which is a significant improvement over previous lifts of approximately 20.48% and 5.59%.

**d. Leverage**

- **Current Train Leverage:** 0.0125
- **Previous Train Leverage:** [0.0289, -0.0041]

*Interpretation:* The leverage is positive, indicating a stronger association between the rule conditions and the predictions than expected by chance. Although it is lower than the highest previous leverage, it is an improvement over the negative leverage observed previously.

---

**2. Performance Assessment**

- **Higher Confidence and Lift:** The increase in confidence and lift indicates that the current rules are more effective at making correct predictions when they apply. The higher lift suggests that the rules are providing valuable insights beyond what would be expected from random chance.

- **Lower Support:** The decrease in support implies that the rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset. This might mean that while the rules are accurate, they are too specific and not generalizing well across the entire dataset.

---

**3. Determining Local Minimum and Iterations**

Given the improvements in confidence and lift but the reduction in support, it appears that the current iteration has focused on refining the rules to increase accuracy at the expense of coverage. This might indicate that we've reached a local optimum where the rules are highly accurate for specific cases but are not capturing the broader patterns in the data.

However, since our goal is to develop rules that are both accurate and widely applicable, it suggests that further iterations are necessary to balance these metrics better. We may not have reached a global minimum yet.

---

**4. Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

**a. Increase Support without Sacrificing Confidence and Lift**

- **Generalize Specific Rules:** Review the current rules to identify opportunities for generalization. For example, if a rule applies to modifiers with a specific functional group at a particular position, consider whether it can be expanded to include similar functional groups or positions.

- **Combine Similar Rules:** Analyze rules that have overlapping conditions or similar effects on yield. Combining such rules can increase support by covering more data points.

**b. Re-examine Low-Support Rules**

- **Rule Relevance:** Assess whether the rules with very low support are capturing rare but critical cases or if they are too narrow. If they are the latter, consider modifying them to encompass a broader range of conditions.

- **Potential Redundancies:** Check for redundancies among the rules. Eliminating or consolidating redundant rules can simplify the rule set and potentially increase overall support.

**c. Explore Uncovered Patterns**

- **Data Analysis:** Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns or relationships in the data that are not currently captured by the rules. This might involve looking at modifiers with intermediate yields or examining combinations of functional groups.

- **Incorporate Additional Features:** Consider integrating other molecular descriptors or properties that might influence the yield. For example, steric factors, electronic parameters, or solubility characteristics could provide additional predictive power.

**d. Balance Specificity and Generality**

- **Avoid Overfitting:** Ensure that the rules are not too tailored to the training data, which could limit their applicability to new data. Introducing some generality can help improve support while maintaining good confidence and lift.

- **Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques to assess the performance of the rules on different subsets of the data. This can help identify rules that perform well universally versus those that are only effective on specific subsets.

---

**5. Conclusion**

The current rules have shown improved accuracy when they apply, as evidenced by higher confidence and lift. However, the reduced support indicates a need to make the rules more general to cover a larger portion of the data. By focusing on increasing support while maintaining reasonable confidence and lift, we can develop a more robust and widely applicable set of rules.

Further iterations should aim to find a balance between specificity and generality, ensuring that the rules are both accurate and broadly applicable. This might involve generalizing existing rules, uncovering new patterns, and carefully evaluating the trade-offs between support, confidence, and lift.

---

**Next Steps**

- **Iterative Refinement:** Continue iterating on the rule set, applying the recommendations above to improve support without significantly compromising confidence and lift.

- **Collaborative Review:** Engage with the team to review the current rules, share insights, and collectively identify areas for enhancement.

- **Monitoring Metrics:** Keep tracking the metrics in each iteration to observe the impact of changes and guide the direction of subsequent refinements.

By adopting these strategies, we should be able to enhance the performance of the rules and better achieve the objectives of the research program.

ML Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation Set and Training Set:**

The current classification model achieved an accuracy of **0.7714** on the validation set. Comparing this to previous iterations:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies:**
  - Consistently around **0.76**, with occasional dips to **0.68** or **0.72**.
- **Previous Test Accuracies:**
  - Varied between **0.75** and **0.625**, indicating potential overfitting in prior models.

The slight improvement in validation accuracy from **0.76** to **0.7714** suggests a modest enhancement in the model's predictive performance. However, without current test accuracy data, it's challenging to conclusively determine whether the model generalizes well to unseen data or if overfitting persists.

**Analysis Based on the SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insight into the contribution of each rule to the model's predictions for individual molecules. By analyzing these contributions, we can identify which rules may be leading to incorrect predictions and require refinement.

**1. Identifying Discrepancies:**

We focus on molecules where the predicted loading does not match the experimental value:

- **False Positives (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**
  - **Molecule:** `C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O`
  - **Molecule:** `C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)O`
  - **Molecule:** `C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O`
- **False Negatives (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**
  - **Molecule:** `C(CCN)CC(=O)O`
  - **Molecule:** `C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N`

**2. Analyzing SHAP Values for Misclassified Molecules:**

***a. False Positives (Overestimated Loadings):***

- **Molecule:** `C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O`  
  - **Rule with Highest Positive SHAP Value:**  
    - **Rule 12:** *SHAP Value:* **0.0563**
  - **Other Significant Positive SHAP Values:**  
    - **Rule 4:** *SHAP Value:* **0.0495**
    - **Rule 3:** *SHAP Value:* **0.0466**

- **Molecule:** `C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O`  
  - **Rule with Highest Positive SHAP Value:**  
    - **Rule 12:** *SHAP Value:* **0.0471**
  - **Other Significant Positive SHAP Values:**  
    - **Rule 11:** *SHAP Value:* **0.0319**
    - **Rule 1:** *SHAP Value:* **0.0378**

***b. False Negatives (Underestimated Loadings):***

- **Molecule:** `C(CCN)CC(=O)O`  
  - **Rule with Highest Negative SHAP Value:**  
    - **Rule 11:** *SHAP Value:* **-0.3667**
  - **Other Significant Negative SHAP Values:**  
    - **Rule 7:** *SHAP Value:* **-0.0510**

- **Molecule:** `C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N`  
  - **Rules with Significant Negative SHAP Values:**  
    - **Rule 11:** *SHAP Value:* **-0.0917**
    - **Rule 4:** *SHAP Value:* **-0.0799**
    - **Rule 3:** *SHAP Value:* **-0.0725**

**3. Interpretation of SHAP Analysis:**

- **Rule 12** frequently contributes **positively** to high loading predictions for molecules that experimentally have **low loading**.
  - **Implication:** Rule 12 may be **overestimating** the impact of certain molecular features on loading.
- **Rule 11** often contributes **negatively** to high loading predictions for molecules that experimentally have **high loading**.
  - **Implication:** Rule 11 may be **underestimating** the positive influence of certain molecular features on loading.

**4. Assessing Overfitting and Underfitting:**

- The consistent validation accuracy with only slight improvement suggests that the model may still be **overfitting** to certain features represented by the rules, particularly Rules 11 and 12.
- The discrepancies between predicted and experimental values indicate that some rules may not be generalizing well to the broader dataset.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

**1. Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values for Overestimated Loadings:**

***Rule 12:***

- **Current Definition:** Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with fluorinated aliphatic chains lead to **low yield**.
- **Observation:** Rule 12 contributes positively to high loading predictions, even when experimental values are low.
  
**Suggested Improvements:**

- **Re-evaluate the Scope of Rule 12:**
  - **Consider Exceptions:** Review molecules with fluorinated chains that exhibit high loading experimentally.
  - **Adjust the Rule:** Modify Rule 12 to account for chain length, degree of fluorination, and the position of fluorine atoms.
  - **Possible Revision:**
    - **Revised Rule 12:** *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with **short, highly fluorinated** aliphatic chains lead to low yield, while those with **longer, less fluorinated** chains may lead to high yield.*
  
- **Expand Supporting Examples:**
  - Include cases where fluorinated modifiers lead to high yield to balance the rule.

**2. Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values for Underestimated Loadings:**

***Rule 11:***

- **Current Definition:** Modifiers with aliphatic amino groups at the delta (δ) position or further from the carboxyl group lead to **low yield**.
- **Observation:** Rule 11 contributes negatively to high loading predictions, even when experimental values are high.

**Suggested Improvements:**

- **Reassess the Distance Criterion:**
  - Investigate if the cutoff at the delta position is too restrictive.
  - Consider modifiers where the amino group, despite being further away, still enhances yield.
  - **Possible Revision:**
    - **Revised Rule 11:** *Modifiers with aliphatic amino groups beyond the gamma (γ) position may still lead to high yield if they are part of a flexible chain that allows effective interaction with the catalyst.*

- **Incorporate Additional Factors:**
  - Examine the role of chain flexibility, branching, and other functional groups that may influence the amino group's effectiveness.
  - Update the rule to reflect these nuances.

**3. Enhance Generalization to Address Overfitting:**

- **Simplify Overly Complex Rules:**
  - Reduce the specificity of rules that may be overfitting to particular examples.
  - Aim for broader applicability without sacrificing accuracy.

- **Combine Similar Rules:**
  - **Rule 6 and Rule 15** both address modifiers with flexible chains containing ether linkages leading to low yield.
  - **Suggestion:** Merge these rules to avoid redundancy and potential overemphasis.

**4. Use Insights from SHAP Analysis to Refine Other Rules:**

- **Evaluate Rules with Consistently High or Low SHAP Values Across Multiple Molecules:**
  - Identify patterns where certain rules strongly influence predictions.
  - For example, if **Rule 4** often contributes negatively for underpredicted high loading molecules, it may need refinement.

- **Iteratively Test Adjustments:**
  - Implement revised rules and assess their impact on model accuracy and SHAP values.
  - Monitor for improvement in correctly predicting experimental values.

**5. Incorporate Additional Data and Domain Knowledge:**

- **Expand the Dataset:**
  - Include more diverse examples to capture a wider range of molecular features.
- **Consult Chemical Expertise:**
  - Leverage insights from chemists to understand the underlying mechanisms influencing loading.
  - Adjust rules to align with established chemical principles.

**Conclusion:**

By refining **Rule 12** and **Rule 11** based on the SHAP analysis, we can address the overestimation and underestimation issues observed in the model's predictions. Adjusting these rules to better capture the nuances of molecular interactions with the catalyst will likely improve the model's accuracy and generalizability.

Additionally, simplifying overly specific rules and combining similar ones can reduce overfitting. Iterative testing and incorporation of domain knowledge will further enhance the effectiveness of the rules and, consequently, the model's predictive performance.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Revise Rules as Suggested:**
   - Update Rule 12 and Rule 11 with the proposed modifications.
2. **Retrain the Model:**
   - Use the updated rules to generate a new feature matrix.
   - Retrain and validate the model to assess improvements.
3. **Perform SHAP Analysis Again:**
   - Analyze the new SHAP values to ensure that the adjustments have mitigated previous issues.
4. **Iterate as Necessary:**
   - Continue refining rules based on performance metrics and SHAP insights until satisfactory accuracy and generalization are achieved.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current set of rules has shown improvements in predictive performance, with higher confidence and lift values compared to previous iterations. However, the support has decreased, indicating that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. Additionally, SHAP analysis has revealed that certain rules may not be functioning as intended or may be contributing to incorrect predictions.

**Key Points from the Discussions:**

1. **Rule Metrics Analysis:**
   - **Confidence and Lift:** Both have increased, suggesting that when the rules apply, they are more likely to make correct predictions.
   - **Support:** Decreased support indicates that the rules cover fewer instances, possibly due to over-specialization.

2. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - **False Positives and Negatives:** Certain molecules are being misclassified, with SHAP values highlighting which rules contribute most to incorrect predictions.
   - **Rules with High Impact:** Rules 11 and 12 have been identified as contributing significantly to misclassifications.

3. **Specific Suggestions for Rule Improvement:**
   - **Rule 2:** Modify the code to accurately detect electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position.
   - **Rule 3:** Adjust the code to ensure it identifies coordinating groups directly attached to the aromatic ring.
   - **Rule 4:** Correct the code to specifically detect methyl groups at the para position.
   - **Rule 5:** Generalize the SMARTS pattern to match aliphatic chains of six or more carbons.
   - **Rules 6 and 15:** Combine these rules to address modifiers containing flexible ether chains consistently.
   - **Rule 8:** Split into two separate functions to handle methionine derivatives and thiol-containing modifiers distinctly.

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Code Implementation of Rules:**
   - **Ensure Accurate Substructure Matching:** Update the SMARTS patterns and code logic for each rule to precisely match the intended molecular features.
   - **Implement Positional Specificity:** For rules that depend on the position of substituents (e.g., para position), verify that atom indices and mapping are correctly handled in the code.
   - **Address Overlapping Rules:** Combine similar rules to reduce redundancy and improve consistency in predictions.

2. **Increase Rule Support Without Sacrificing Confidence:**
   - **Generalize Rules Where Appropriate:** Broaden the scope of rules that are too specific to cover more instances, thereby increasing support.
   - **Balance Specificity and Generality:** Aim for rules that are neither too broad (leading to low confidence) nor too narrow (resulting in low support).

3. **Adjust Rules Based on SHAP Analysis:**
   - **Rule 11 (Aliphatic Amino Groups):**
     - **Observation:** Contributes negatively to high loading predictions even when the experimental value is high.
     - **Action:** Reevaluate the distance criterion of amino groups from the carboxyl group. Consider flexibility and other functional groups that may enhance interaction with the catalyst.
     - **Revised Rule Suggestion:** Modifiers with aliphatic amino groups beyond the gamma (γ) position may still lead to high yield if they are part of a flexible chain allowing effective interaction with the catalyst.

   - **Rule 12 (Fluorinated Chains):**
     - **Observation:** Sometimes contributes positively to high loading predictions when the experimental value is low.
     - **Action:** Reassess the impact of chain length and degree of fluorination. Modify the rule to distinguish between short, highly fluorinated chains (leading to low yield) and longer chains with fewer fluorines (which may not adversely affect yield).

4. **Implement Unit Tests for Rule Functions:**
   - **Test with Known Examples:** Use molecules with known outcomes to verify that each rule correctly predicts high or low yield as intended.
   - **Ensure Robustness:** Verify that the rules behave correctly across a range of molecules, catching any unintended matches or omissions.

5. **Leverage Chemical Domain Knowledge:**
   - **Consult Chemists or Literature:** Gain insights into the underlying chemical interactions that may influence catalyst activity and yield.
   - **Incorporate Additional Features:** Consider other molecular properties (e.g., steric factors, electronic effects) that may affect the reaction outcome.

6. **Balance Model Complexity to Avoid Overfitting:**
   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules:** Reduce unnecessary complexity in rules that may be overfitting the training data.
   - **Validate with Cross-Validation:** Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

Yes, there is a possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the rules as suggested, we can improve their applicability and accuracy across a broader range of molecules. Adjusting the rules based on SHAP analysis and ensuring that they are grounded in chemical reasoning will enhance their predictive performance while maintaining generalizability.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Modify Rule 2 to Accurately Detect Para Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs) in Aromatic Carboxylic Acids**

  - *Action*: Update the SMARTS pattern to correctly identify electron-withdrawing groups located at the para position relative to the carboxyl group on aromatic rings.
  - *Implementation*: Ensure that the code specifies the para position explicitly. Use SMARTS patterns that match EWGs such as nitro (–[N+](=O)[O-]), halogens ([F,Cl,Br,I]), cyano (–C#N), trifluoromethyl (–C(F)(F)F), etc., attached to the aromatic ring at the position opposite the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust Rule 3 to Ensure Identification of Coordinating Groups Directly Attached to the Aromatic Ring**

  - *Action*: Refine the code to detect functional groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino (–NH₂), hydroxy (–OH), pyridinyl nitrogen) that are directly bonded to the aromatic ring.
  - *Implementation*: Modify SMARTS patterns to identify these coordinating groups attached directly to the ring without any intervening atoms. Ensure that the position of the substituent (ortho, meta, or para) is considered if relevant to the rule.

- **Advice 3**: **Correct Rule 4 to Specifically Detect Para Methyl Groups on Aromatic Carboxylic Acids**

  - *Action*: Update the SMARTS pattern to accurately identify methyl groups (–CH₃) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group on aromatic rings.
  - *Implementation*: Use a SMARTS pattern that specifies a methyl group attached to the aromatic ring at the position opposite the carboxyl group. Ensure positional specificity by defining the relative positions in the aromatic system.

- **Advice 4**: **Generalize Rule 5 to Match Aliphatic Chains of Six or More Carbons**

  - *Action*: Broaden the SMARTS pattern to include any aliphatic carboxylic acid with a carbon chain length of six or more, regardless of minor substituents that do not interfere with catalyst interaction.
  - *Implementation*: Create a SMARTS pattern that matches straight or branched aliphatic chains with six or more carbons terminated with a carboxylic acid group, excluding chains with interfering functional groups like hydroxyls or amines.

- **Advice 5**: **Combine Rules 6 and 15 to Address Flexible Ether Chains Consistently**

  - *Action*: Merge Rules 6 and 15 into a single rule that covers modifiers containing flexible ether linkages (e.g., ethylene glycol units), which tend to lead to low yield.
  - *Implementation*: Develop a unified SMARTS pattern that detects multiple ether linkages in the molecule, especially when forming flexible chains or linkers between functional groups. Identify patterns like –O–(CH₂CH₂O)_n– where n ≥ 1.

- **Advice 6**: **Split Rule 8 into Two Separate Rules for Methionine Derivatives and Thiol-Containing Modifiers**

  - *Action*: Separate Rule 8 to distinctly address the different effects of thioether-containing methionine derivatives and free thiol (–SH) containing modifiers on yield.
  - *Implementation*:
    - **Rule 8a**: Modifiers that are methionine derivatives or contain thioether groups (–S–CH₃) lead to low yield due to less accessible sulfur for metal coordination.
    - **Rule 8b**: Modifiers with accessible thiol groups (–SH) lead to high yield if the thiol is not sterically hindered and can coordinate effectively with metal centers.

- **Advice 7**: **Reevaluate and Adjust Rule 11 Regarding Aliphatic Amino Groups**

  - *Action*: Reconsider the distance criterion for amino groups in aliphatic carboxylic acids. Recognize that amino groups beyond the gamma (γ) position may contribute positively to yield if they can interact with the catalyst.
  - *Implementation*: Modify Rule 11 to reflect that modifiers with aliphatic amino groups located at the delta (δ) position or further can lead to high yield if the chain is flexible enough to facilitate interaction between the amino group and the catalyst's metal centers.

- **Advice 8**: **Reassess Rule 12 to Distinguish Between Different Fluorinated Chains**

  - *Action*: Update Rule 12 to differentiate between modifiers with short, highly fluorinated aliphatic chains (which lead to low yield) and those with longer chains and fewer fluorine substitutions (which may not negatively affect yield).
  - *Implementation*: Adjust the SMARTS patterns to specifically identify perfluorinated chains (e.g., –(CF₂)_nCF₃) and associate them with low yield. Allow modifiers with fewer fluorines or partial fluorination in longer chains to be evaluated separately.

- **Advice 9**: **Implement Unit Tests for Rule Functions Using Known Examples**

  - *Action*: Develop unit tests for each rule using molecules with known high or low yields to verify that the code correctly identifies and applies the rules.
  - *Implementation*: For each rule, create a set of test cases including molecules listed in the dataset and additional examples. Check that the rule function returns the expected result (True for high yield, False for low yield) for each test case.

- **Advice 10**: **Simplify Overly Complex Rules to Avoid Overfitting**

  - *Action*: Review all rules for unnecessary complexity and specificity that might limit their general applicability. Simplify rules to increase their support while maintaining high confidence and lift.
  - *Implementation*: Remove redundant conditions, merge similar criteria, and focus on the most impactful molecular features based on chemical understanding and data analysis. Ensure each rule has a clear and generalizable basis.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Generalize Rules for Numeric Encoding**

  Revise the current rules to make them more general and less specific to particular molecules. This will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix from SMILES strings. For example, instead of detailing specific substituents at exact positions, use descriptors like "presence of electron-donating groups adjacent to the carboxyl group" or "aromatic rings with coordinating heteroatoms."

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Molecular Descriptors Computable from SMILES**

  Focus on creating rules based on molecular descriptors that can be directly computed from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools. Parameters such as the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, topological polar surface area (TPSA), logP values, and counts of specific functional groups or substructures can be quantified and included in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationships (QSAR)**

  Develop rules that align with QSAR principles, allowing for the modeling of relationships between chemical structures and their observed yields. This approach can help in converting structural features into numerical values, making it easier to predict yields based on the modifiers' chemical properties.

- **Advice 4**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules**

  Identify and merge rules that address similar structural features or underlying chemical principles to reduce redundancy. For instance, rules concerning electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings can be combined, specifying the general effect of such groups regardless of their exact nature.

- **Advice 5**: **Emphasize Electronic and Steric Factors**

  Create rules that account for electronic effects (e.g., presence of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups) and steric hindrance (e.g., bulkiness of substituents). These factors are fundamental in chemical reactions and can often be quantified for inclusion in a feature matrix.

- **Advice 6**: **Define Rules Based on Coordinating Atom Types and Positions**

  Instead of specifying exact functional groups, generalize rules to reflect the presence and position of heteroatoms capable of coordinating with the metal center, such as nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atoms within certain distances from the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 7**: **Introduce Numeric Scoring for Functional Groups**

  Assign numerical scores or weights to different functional groups based on their expected impact on yield. For example, amino groups near the carboxyl group could have a positive score, while fluorinated chains might have a negative score. This quantification aids in creating a more versatile feature matrix.

- **Advice 8**: **Leverage Substructure Searches and Fingerprints**

  Utilize substructure searching and molecular fingerprinting methods to identify and encode relevant structural motifs within the modifiers. These techniques translate the presence or absence of specific substructures into binary or count-based features suitable for numerical analysis.

- **Advice 9**: **Implement Distance-Based Descriptors**

  Develop descriptors that consider the spatial relationship between functional groups and coordinating atoms, such as the number of bonds between the carboxyl group and an amino group. This approach allows for more nuanced rules that reflect the importance of functional group positioning.

- **Advice 10**: **Employ Machine Learning-Friendly Feature Engineering**

  Tailor the rules to produce features compatible with machine learning algorithms. This includes normalizing numerical values, encoding categorical variables appropriately, and ensuring that features are independent to avoid multicollinearity issues.

      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that have **highly fluorinated aliphatic chains** lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative, which can reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group by withdrawing electron density. Additionally, fluorinated compounds may not interact favorably with the catalyst's surface.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are **polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids)** lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide numerous sites for hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst. This enhances the overall interaction between the modifier and the catalyst.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Gluconic acid derivative.)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring** lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination by forming undesired complexes. This reduces the availability of the carboxyl group and diminishes catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with aromatic aldehyde carboxylic acids.)*

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* is clear in its definition, allowing us to identify modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups. The property insight is reasonable, explaining that the absence of steric hindrance facilitates interaction with the catalyst's metal centers. However, the rule has low coverage, being supported by only one high-yield example (octanoic acid) and lacking low-yield examples for contrast. While the simplicity aids clarity, the rule could benefit from additional supporting data to strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* is precise, specifying that aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups at the β or γ positions lead to high yield. The property insight is strong, highlighting enhanced chelation due to the positioning of functional groups. The rule demonstrates appropriate complexity by considering both the type and position of functional groups. Coverage is good, with three high-yield examples and two low-yield examples where functional groups are beyond the γ position, supporting the rule's validity.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* clearly identifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted coordinating groups lead to high yield. The property insight is solid, emphasizing increased electron density and coordination sites. The rule shows complexity by focusing on specific substituents and their positions. Coverage is adequate, supported by three high-yield examples and two low-yield counterexamples involving non-coordinating or interfering groups, reinforcing the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* is clear, describing nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring as leading to high yield. The property insight is appropriate, explaining enhanced coordination via nitrogen atoms. The rule balances complexity by combining ring type and functional group positioning. Coverage is moderate, with three high-yield examples and one low-yield example where the carboxyl group is not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring, supporting the rule.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* effectively states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups beyond the γ position result in low yield. The clarity is high, and the property insight is logical, citing reduced coordination efficiency due to increased distance. The rule's complexity is appropriate, considering both the type and relative position of functional groups. Coverage is strong, with multiple low-yield examples and contrasting high-yield cases when the functional groups are at the γ position.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* addresses amino acids with side chains containing coordinating functional groups, leading to high yield, while those without lead to low yield. The clarity is satisfactory, and the property insight connects coordination ability with the presence of specific side-chain functional groups. The rule shows complexity by considering the side-chain structure in amino acids. However, coverage is limited, supported by one high-yield example (tryptophan derivative) and one low-yield example (phenylalanine derivative). Additional data points would enhance the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* specifies that modifiers with polyether chains or ether linkages lead to low yield. The rule is clear, and the property insight is acceptable, noting that flexibility from ether linkages may hinder coordination. The complexity is moderate, focusing on specific structural features. Coverage is limited, with two supporting low-yield examples. Including more examples would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* indicates that highly fluorinated aliphatic chains in modifiers result in low yield. Clarity is good, and the property insight regarding electron-withdrawing effects is sound. The rule is simple in complexity. Coverage is limited to two low-yield examples, suggesting a need for more supporting data to confirm the rule's generality.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* states that polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) lead to high yield. The rule is clear, and the property insight is valid, attributing enhanced interaction to multiple hydroxyl groups. Complexity is moderate, considering multiple functional groups within the modifiers. Coverage is limited, with two high-yield examples and no low-yield counterparts, indicating that additional data could improve the rule's credibility.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* asserts that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring lead to low yield. The rule is clear, and the property insight about possible side reactions or interference with coordination is reasonable. Complexity is low, focusing on a single functional group. Coverage is minimal, supported by only one low-yield example and lacking high-yield contrasts. More examples are needed to substantiate the rule fully.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids can interact effectively with the catalyst's metal centers without steric hindrance or interference from other functional groups. The unimpeded carboxyl group can coordinate with metal ions in the catalyst, facilitating the reaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups.)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) or hydroxyl (–OH) groups at the beta (β) or gamma (γ) positions** relative to the carboxyl group lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of amino or hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group enhances the ability to chelate metal centers in the catalyst. This chelation strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, promoting higher catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group beyond the γ position reduces coordination efficiency.)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of coordination**, such as amino (–NH₂), nitro (–NO₂), or bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Coordinating groups at the para position enhance electron density and provide additional sites for interaction with metal centers in the catalyst. This increases the effectiveness of the modifier in stabilizing the catalyst and promoting the reaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is non-coordinating.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring** lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity and catalytic activity. The direct attachment of the carboxyl group ensures effective positioning for coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Carboxyl group is attached to a benzene ring, not directly to the pyridine ring.)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups beyond the gamma (γ) position** lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups located too far from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with the catalyst's metal centers. The increased distance reduces the likelihood of forming strong chelation bonds, diminishing catalytic enhancement.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at γ position.)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains containing functional groups capable of coordination**, such as indole nitrogen, **lead to high yield**, while those without such groups **lead to low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Side chains with coordinating functional groups enhance the interaction with metal centers in the catalyst, improving catalytic performance. Amino acids lacking these groups do not provide additional coordination sites and are less effective.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative with indole nitrogen.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenylalanine derivative without coordinating heteroatoms.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with **polyether chains or ether linkages** in their structure lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and may prevent optimal alignment of coordinating groups with the catalyst's active sites. This reduces the efficiency of coordination and diminishes catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that have **highly fluorinated aliphatic chains** lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative, which can reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group by withdrawing electron density. Additionally, fluorinated compounds may not interact favorably with the catalyst's surface.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are **polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids)** lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide numerous sites for hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst. This enhances the overall interaction between the modifier and the catalyst.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Gluconic acid derivative.)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids.)*

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring** lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination by forming undesired complexes. This reduces the availability of the carboxyl group and diminishes catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with aromatic aldehyde carboxylic acids.)*

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Modify the code for Rule 5 to ensure that it only applies to **aliphatic carboxylic acids**. Currently, the code applies Rule 5 to any molecule with a carboxylic acid and an amino or hydroxyl group not at the beta or gamma positions, including aromatic compounds. Add a condition to check for the absence of aromatic atoms before applying Rule 5. For example, include `not mol.HasSubstructMatch(smarts_patterns['aromatic_atom'])` in the condition.**

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Revise the SMARTS patterns for `beta_amino_acid` and `gamma_amino_acid` to accurately capture amino groups at the beta or gamma positions relative to the carboxyl group. The current patterns may incorrectly match amino groups at the alpha position. Consider using more specific patterns that define the exact atom connectivity and distances. For example, use recursive SMARTS or adjust the patterns to reflect the correct positions.**

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Update the code for Rule 2 to ensure it doesn't match amino groups at the alpha position. Include additional conditions or refine the SMARTS patterns to distinguish between alpha, beta, and gamma positions. This will prevent false positives where the amino group is not at the desired position.**

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **In Rule 1, expand the list of functional groups to exclude to ensure only simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups are matched. The current `other_functional_groups` may not include all possible interfering groups. Consider including halogens, sulfur-containing groups, carbonyls (other than the carboxyl group), and other heteroatoms. Also, ensure that the molecule does not contain any rings.**

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Improve the SMARTS patterns for Rule 3 to comprehensively capture para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups. The current patterns may be too narrow and miss valid matches or incorrectly include ortho or meta substitutions. Consider defining a general pattern that matches any aromatic carboxylic acid with a coordinating group at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.**

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **For Rule 6, refine the SMARTS patterns to differentiate amino acids with coordinating side chains from those without. Create specific patterns for side chains containing indole nitrogen (e.g., tryptophan derivatives) and exclude side chains without coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine). Ensure the pattern accurately reflects the entire side chain and its attachment to the amino acid backbone.**

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Review and update all SMARTS patterns for accuracy and specificity. Use validated SMARTS from reliable cheminformatics resources or tools like the RDKit's built-in functional group definitions. This will improve the reliability of pattern matching and reduce false positives or negatives in the feature matrix.**

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

Upon reviewing the current rules and their associated metrics, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**, we can draw several insights by comparing them to the reference metrics from previous iterations.

### **Comparison with Reference Metrics**

1. **Support**:
   - **Previous Metrics**: The train support ranged from **0.1667** to **0.1845**.
   - **Current Metrics**: The train support is **0.08**.
   - **Observation**: There is a noticeable decrease in support, indicating that the current rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset compared to previous rules.

2. **Confidence**:
   - **Previous Metrics**: The train confidence ranged from **0.5396** to **0.6352**.
   - **Current Metrics**: The train confidence has increased to **0.7184**.
   - **Observation**: There is a significant improvement in confidence, suggesting that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of correctly predicting the outcome has increased.

3. **Lift**:
   - **Previous Metrics**: The train lift ranged from **1.0559** to **1.2048**.
   - **Current Metrics**: The train lift has increased to **1.4454**.
   - **Observation**: The lift has improved substantially, indicating that the rules are more effective at predicting the outcome compared to random chance, and the association between the conditions and the prediction is stronger.

4. **Leverage**:
   - **Previous Metrics**: The train leverage values were **0.0289** and **-0.0041**.
   - **Current Metrics**: The train leverage is **0.0154**.
   - **Observation**: The leverage is positive, reaffirming a stronger association than expected by chance. However, it's slightly lower than the highest previous value, implying a trade-off with the increased confidence and lift.

### **Evaluation of Current Rules**

The current set of rules demonstrates an advance in terms of **confidence** and **lift**:

- **Higher Confidence**: An increase to **71.84%** means that when the rule conditions are satisfied, there is a higher probability that the prediction will be correct. This enhances the reliability of the rules.
  
- **Higher Lift**: A lift of **1.4454** signifies that the rule's prediction is about **44.54%** more likely than random chance, highlighting the rule's utility in identifying meaningful relationships in the data.

However, the **decrease in Support** from approximately **17-18%** to **8%** indicates that the rules are applicable to a smaller subset of the dataset:

- **Reduced Coverage**: Fewer data points satisfy the rule conditions, which might limit the generalizability or practical applicability of the rules in broader contexts.
  
- **Trade-Off**: The improvement in confidence and lift comes at the expense of coverage. This suggests a focus on more specific conditions that yield better predictions but apply less frequently.

### **Assessment of Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency**

Considering the metrics and the changes observed:

- **Local Minimum**:
  - The increase in confidence and lift suggests that the current rules are closer to an optimal set within the current parameter space.
  - However, the decrease in support might indicate that the algorithm has overfitted to specific instances, potentially settling in a local maximum for confidence and lift but a local minimum for support.

- **Iteration Sufficiency**:
  - The notable changes in metrics imply that further iterations could still yield beneficial adjustments.
  - Additional iterations may help in balancing the trade-off between confidence, lift, and support, possibly finding rules that maintain high predictive power while covering a larger portion of the dataset.

### **Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the rules and address the observed trade-offs, consider the following strategies:

1. **Balance Between Support and Confidence**:
   - **Adjust Rule Conditions**: Modify the existing rules to be slightly less restrictive. This could involve relaxing certain conditions or combining similar rules to cover more instances without significantly compromising confidence.
   - **Expand Coverage**: Identify common features among instances not currently covered by the rules and incorporate these into new or existing rules.

2. **Optimize Rule Specificity**:
   - **Generalize Where Appropriate**: Where possible, abstract specific functional groups or structural motifs to broader categories that still retain high confidence.
   - **Avoid Overfitting**: Ensure that the rules are not overly tailored to specific examples, which might not generalize well to unseen data.

3. **Analyze Misclassified Instances**:
   - **Examine Low Yield Cases**: Investigate why certain modifiers lead to low yields despite having features similar to high-yield examples. This could reveal additional factors influencing the reaction.
   - **Incorporate Missing Variables**: Consider other molecular descriptors or reaction conditions that may account for discrepancies, and include them in the rule formulation.

4. **Leverage Domain Knowledge**:
   - **Chemical Intuition**: Use insights from chemistry to identify functional groups or molecular interactions that could enhance the yield but are not currently captured by the rules.
   - **Mechanistic Understanding**: Incorporate knowledge of the reaction mechanism to refine rules in line with the known catalytic pathways.

5. **Cross-Validation and Testing**:
   - **Evaluate on Test Data**: Check how the rules perform on unseen data to ensure that the improvements are not confined to the training set.
   - **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Use the performance on test data to guide further adjustments, aiming for rules that generalize well.

6. **Combination of Rules**:
   - **Rule Ensemble**: Consider an ensemble approach where multiple rules contribute to the prediction, potentially balancing coverage and confidence.
   - **Weighted Rules**: Assign weights to rules based on their performance metrics to prioritize the most reliable ones while still considering others.

7. **Alternative Metrics**:
   - **Monitor Additional Metrics**: Include other evaluation metrics like **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score** to gain a more nuanced understanding of the rules' performance.
   - **Assess Statistical Significance**: Determine if the observed improvements are statistically significant or due to random fluctuations.

### **Conclusion**

The current rules exhibit improved confidence and lift, indicating stronger predictive power and more meaningful associations. However, the reduced support suggests that these rules apply to a smaller segment of the data, potentially limiting their practical utility.

To enhance the rules further:

- **Aim for a Balance**: Strive to find rules that maintain high confidence and lift while increasing support.
- **Iterate Thoughtfully**: Perform additional iterations with targeted adjustments based on detailed analysis.
- **Integrate Knowledge**: Utilize chemical expertise to inform rule modifications and ensure they align with known scientific principles.

By addressing these aspects, we can develop a set of rules that not only predict high yields with greater accuracy but also apply to a broader range of modifiers, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the catalytic research program.

ML Commenter Message:
**Comments on Accuracies of the Validation Set and Train Set:**

The latest iteration yields an accuracy of **48.57%**, which is a significant decline compared to previous iterations where accuracies were consistently around **76%** to **77%**. The earlier models demonstrated relatively stable performance across validation and test sets, with validation accuracies consistently in the **0.76** range and test accuracies ranging from **62.5%** to **75%**. The sudden drop to **48.57%** indicates a decrease in the model's predictive performance.

This decline suggests that the current set of rules used to generate the feature matrix may not be capturing the underlying patterns effectively. The model might be underfitting, failing to learn the relationship between the features and the target variable. Alternatively, changes made in the most recent iteration could have adversely impacted the model's ability to generalize.

---

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into the contribution of each feature (rule) to the model's prediction for each sample. By analyzing these values, we can identify which rules are influencing the model's predictions significantly, especially in cases where the model's prediction does not match the experimental value.

**Discrepancies Between Predicted and Experimental Values:**

1. **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - **Molecules:**
     - C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
     - C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O
     - C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N
     - C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O
     - C(CCN)CC(=O)O
     - C1=CC2=C(C=C1C(=O)O)C(=O)OC2=O
     - C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)[N+](=O)[O-]
     - COC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C(=O)CCC(=O)O)OC

   - **SHAP Values:**
     - The rules with the most **negative SHAP values** for high loading in these cases are **Rule 4** and **Rule 6**.
     - **Rule 4 SHAP value:** Approximately **-0.0374**
     - **Rule 6 SHAP value:** Approximately **-0.0193**

   - **Interpretation:**
     - The negative SHAP values indicate that **Rule 4** and **Rule 6** are contributing significantly to predicting a **low loading** when the experimental value is **high**.
     - **Rule 4** and **Rule 6** may be too restrictive or not accurately capturing the characteristics of these high-loading modifiers.

2. **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecules:**
     - C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O
     - C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F (somewhat ambiguous due to low SHAP value)
     - C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)C(=O)O
     - CSCC[C@@H](C(=O)NCC(=O)O)N
     - C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O
     - C(COCCOCCN)C(=O)O
     - COCCOCCOCC(=O)O
     - C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O
     - C(CCCN)CCC(=O)O

   - **SHAP Values:**
     - The rules with the most **positive SHAP values** for high loading in these cases are **Rule 8** and **Rule 10**.
     - **Rule 8 SHAP value:** Approximately **0.0405** to **0.0427**
     - **Rule 10 SHAP value:** Approximately **0.0219** to **0.0241**

   - **Interpretation:**
     - The positive SHAP values indicate that **Rule 8** and **Rule 10** are contributing significantly to predicting a **high loading** when the experimental value is **low**.
     - **Rule 8** and **Rule 10** may be overgeneralizing or incorrectly identifying features that lead to high loading.

---

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

The significant drop in accuracy suggests that the model may be **underfitting**, failing to capture the complexity of the data with the current set of rules. The rules might be too simplistic or not adequately representing the critical features that determine the modifiers' loading on the catalyst.

Alternatively, changes to the rules might have removed important features that were contributing to better performance in previous iterations. It's also possible that some rules are conflicting, leading to confusion in the model's predictions.

---

**Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics:**

The decrease from an accuracy of around **77%** to **48%** indicates that the modifications made in the current iteration have not improved the model and may have deteriorated its predictive ability. This suggests that the probability of improvement with the current set of rules is low, and revisiting the rules is necessary.

---

**Insights from SHAP Analysis for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Rule 4 and Rule 6 (Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations):**

   - **Implication:** These rules are causing the model to predict low loading when it should be high.
   - **Possible Issues:**
     - **Rule 4:** Might be incorrectly penalizing modifiers that actually lead to high loading.
     - **Rule 6:** May not be accurately characterizing the modifiers' functional groups or their positions.

2. **Rule 8 and Rule 10 (Positive SHAP Values in Overestimations):**

   - **Implication:** These rules are causing the model to predict high loading when it should be low.
   - **Possible Issues:**
     - **Rule 8:** Could be too broadly defined, capturing modifiers that do not lead to high loading.
     - **Rule 10:** May need refinement to better discriminate between modifiers leading to high vs. low loading.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Rule 4:**

   - **Current Rule 4:** Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring lead to high yield.
   - **Issues Identified:**
     - Overly broad classification may include modifiers that do not enhance loading.
     - Negative SHAP values suggest that this rule is contributing to underestimation in certain cases.
   - **Suggested Improvements:**
     - **Specify Positioning:** Refine the rule to consider the position of nitrogen within the heterocycle. For example, distinguish between pyridine-2-carboxylic acid and pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, as their coordination properties differ.
     - **Consider Additional Functional Groups:** Account for the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups on the ring, which can influence coordination ability.

2. **Refine Rule 6:**

   - **Current Rule 6:** Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing functional groups capable of coordination, such as indole nitrogen, lead to high yield, while those without such groups lead to low yield.
   - **Issues Identified:**
     - The rule may not account for all functional groups that can coordinate or might misclassify certain amino acids.
     - Negative SHAP values indicate underestimation of modifiers that should lead to high loading.
   - **Suggested Improvements:**
     - **Expand Functional Groups:** Include other side chains capable of coordination, such as thiol (–SH) groups in cysteine or imidazole rings in histidine.
     - **Evaluate Side Chain Accessibility:** Consider steric hindrance that might prevent coordination despite the presence of functional groups.

3. **Adjust Rule 8:**

   - **Current Rule 8:** Modifiers that have highly fluorinated aliphatic chains lead to low yield.
   - **Issues Identified:**
     - The rule may be misclassifying certain modifiers, leading to overestimation of loading in cases where the experimental value is low.
     - Positive SHAP values in overestimated cases suggest the rule is contributing to high loading predictions incorrectly.
   - **Suggested Improvements:**
     - **Refine the Scope:** Specify the degree of fluorination or chain length that leads to low yield.
     - **Consider Electronic Effects:** Include the impact of fluorine atoms on the electron density of the carboxyl group.

4. **Adjust Rule 10:**

   - **Current Rule 10:** Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring lead to low yield.
   - **Issues Identified:**
     - The rule may inadvertently include modifiers that do not have aldehyde groups but are being influenced by Rule 10.
     - Positive SHAP values in overestimated cases indicate the rule is not effectively differentiating modifiers.
   - **Suggested Improvements:**
     - **Increase Specificity:** Ensure that the rule strictly applies to modifiers with aldehyde groups and does not overlap with other aromatic carboxylic acids.
     - **Include Steric and Electronic Factors:** Consider whether neighboring substituents or steric hindrance affect the modifier's performance.

5. **General Improvements:**

   - **Feature Engineering:**
     - Incorporate additional molecular descriptors that capture electronic properties, steric hindrance, and coordination potential.
     - Use quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) to enhance the feature matrix.

   - **Model Complexity:**
     - Consider using more sophisticated models that can capture nonlinear relationships if appropriate.
     - Evaluate whether a different classification algorithm might perform better with the given data.

   - **Cross-validation:**
     - Use k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance more robustly.
     - Ensure that the validation sets are representative of the overall data distribution.

   - **Data Augmentation:**
     - If the dataset is limited, consider augmenting it with additional relevant data to improve the model's learning.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current rules, particularly **Rule 4**, **Rule 6**, **Rule 8**, and **Rule 10**, appear to be contributing to inaccuracies in the model's predictions. Refining these rules by increasing their specificity and ensuring they accurately reflect the underlying chemical principles should improve the model's performance. Additionally, enhancing the feature matrix with more detailed molecular descriptors and reassessing the model's complexity may address the underfitting issue indicated by the drop in accuracy.

**Next Steps:**

- **Revise the identified rules** based on the suggestions provided.
- **Recompute the feature matrix** with the updated rules.
- **Retrain the classification model** and monitor the changes in accuracy.
- **Perform thorough SHAP analysis** on the new model to ensure that the rules are contributing positively to correct predictions.
- **Iterate the process** until the model shows consistent and improved performance.

By systematically refining the rules and incorporating feedback from the SHAP analysis, we can improve the model's predictive ability and gain deeper insights into the factors influencing the loading of modifiers on the catalyst.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules:**

The recent analysis of the catalytic reaction involving modified catalysts and molecular modifiers revealed several key insights:

1. **Rule Metrics Analysis:**
   - The current rules exhibit higher confidence (**71.84%**) and lift (**1.4454**) compared to previous iterations. This indicates that when the rules apply, they are more likely to predict the correct outcome, and the association between the rules and high yield is stronger.
   - However, the support for the rules has decreased to **8%**, meaning they cover a smaller portion of the dataset. This trade-off suggests that the rules have become more specific, potentially limiting their applicability.

2. **Accuracy and SHAP Analysis:**
   - The validation accuracy has dropped significantly from around **76%** to **48.57%**, indicating a decline in the model's overall predictive performance.
   - SHAP analysis identified certain rules contributing negatively or positively to incorrect predictions:
     - **Rule 4** and **Rule 6** tend to underestimate the yield when it should be high.
     - **Rule 8** and **Rule 10** tend to overestimate the yield when it should be low.

3. **Potential Issues with Current Rules:**
   - **Rule 4** may be too broad, improperly classifying some modifiers that lead to high yield as low yield.
   - **Rule 6** might not accurately distinguish between amino acids with coordinating side chains and those without.
   - **Rule 8** could be overgeneralizing, leading to incorrect high yield predictions for modifiers that should yield low outcomes.
   - **Rule 10** may not be specific enough, inadvertently including modifiers that do not fit the intended criteria.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Rule 4:**
   - **Specify Nitrogen Positioning:** Modify the rule to account for the position of nitrogen atoms within heteroaromatic rings. Focus on positions that enhance coordination with the catalyst.
   - **Consider Electronic Effects:** Include the influence of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups on the ring, which can affect coordination ability.

2. **Revise Rule 6:**
   - **Expand Functional Groups:** Include other side chains capable of coordination, such as thiol (–SH) groups in cysteine or imidazole rings in histidine.
   - **Assess Side Chain Accessibility:** Consider steric hindrance and the spatial arrangement of functional groups that may impact their ability to coordinate with the catalyst.

3. **Adjust Rule 8:**
   - **Limit Scope of Fluorination:** Specify the level of fluorination and chain length that negatively affect yield, ensuring that only highly fluorinated chains are categorized as leading to low yield.
   - **Incorporate Electronic Considerations:** Address how fluorination affects electron density around the carboxyl group and its impact on coordination.

4. **Update Rule 10:**
   - **Increase Specificity:** Ensure that the rule exclusively applies to aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring, without unintentionally including other modifiers.
   - **Factor in Steric and Electronic Influences:** Evaluate how neighboring substituents might affect the modifier's interaction with the catalyst.

5. **Enhance SMARTS Patterns and Rule Definitions:**
   - **Improve Pattern Accuracy:** Refine SMARTS patterns to more precisely capture the intended functional groups and structural motifs, reducing false positives and negatives.
   - **Use Validated Patterns:** Utilize established patterns from reliable cheminformatics resources, ensuring consistency and accuracy in feature extraction.

6. **Balance Rule Specificity and Coverage:**
   - **Broaden Applicability:** Adjust the rules to cover a larger portion of the dataset without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
   - **Combine Similar Rules:** Merge rules with overlapping criteria to streamline the rule set and enhance coverage.

7. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors:**
   - **Include Electronic and Steric Factors:** Use quantitative descriptors that capture electronic properties, steric hindrance, and coordination potentials.
   - **Explore Advanced Features:** Consider software tools or databases that provide detailed molecular properties relevant to the reaction mechanism.

8. **Re-evaluate the Model:**
   - **Test Alternative Algorithms:** Experiment with different classification models that might better capture complex relationships in the data.
   - **Cross-validate Results:** Use robust cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

Yes, there is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the rules based on chemical knowledge and addressing the specific issues identified, we can improve the model's predictive performance while maintaining generalizability. Careful adjustment of the rules and thorough validation using cross-validation techniques can help prevent overfitting.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids can interact effectively with the catalyst's metal centers without steric hindrance or interference from other functional groups. The unimpeded carboxyl group can coordinate with metal ions in the catalyst, facilitating the reaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups.)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) or hydroxyl (–OH) groups at the beta (β) or gamma (γ) positions** relative to the carboxyl group lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of amino or hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group enhances the ability to chelate metal centers in the catalyst. This chelation strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, promoting higher catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group beyond the γ position reduces coordination efficiency.)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of coordination**, such as amino (–NH₂), nitro (–NO₂), or bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Coordinating groups at the para position enhance electron density and provide additional sites for interaction with metal centers in the catalyst. This increases the effectiveness of the modifier in stabilizing the catalyst and promoting the reaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is non-coordinating.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring** lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity and catalytic activity. The direct attachment of the carboxyl group ensures effective positioning for coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Carboxyl group is attached to a benzene ring, not directly to the pyridine ring.)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups beyond the gamma (γ) position** lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups located too far from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with the catalyst's metal centers. The increased distance reduces the likelihood of forming strong chelation bonds, diminishing catalytic enhancement.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at γ position.)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains containing functional groups capable of coordination**, such as indole nitrogen, **lead to high yield**, while those without such groups **lead to low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Side chains with coordinating functional groups enhance the interaction with metal centers in the catalyst, improving catalytic performance. Amino acids lacking these groups do not provide additional coordination sites and are less effective.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative with indole nitrogen.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenylalanine derivative without coordinating heteroatoms.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with **polyether chains or ether linkages** in their structure lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and may prevent optimal alignment of coordinating groups with the catalyst's active sites. This reduces the efficiency of coordination and diminishes catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that have **highly fluorinated aliphatic chains** lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative, which can reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group by withdrawing electron density. Additionally, fluorinated compounds may not interact favorably with the catalyst's surface.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are **polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids)** lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide numerous sites for hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst. This enhances the overall interaction between the modifier and the catalyst.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Gluconic acid derivative.)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring** lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination by forming undesired complexes. This reduces the availability of the carboxyl group and diminishes catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with aromatic aldehyde carboxylic acids.)*

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 4 by specifying nitrogen positioning and electronic effects in nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids.**
  - **Action**: Modify Rule 4 to focus on heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the nitrogen atom is positioned to enhance coordination with the catalyst's metal centers. Specifically, prioritize molecules where the nitrogen atom is adjacent to the carboxyl group or capable of chelating through conjugation.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Update the SMARTS pattern to target specific nitrogen positions in the heteroaromatic ring (e.g., pyridine N-oxides, pyrimidines).
    - Exclude structures where the nitrogen atom is hindered or unable to participate effectively in coordination.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Improved accuracy by correctly classifying modifiers that truly enhance yield due to optimal nitrogen positioning.

- **Advice 2**: **Revise Rule 6 to include additional amino acids with side chains capable of coordination and assess side chain accessibility.**
  - **Action**: Expand Rule 6 to encompass amino acids with other coordinating side chains such as thiol (–SH) in cysteine and imidazole (–C₃N₂H₄) in histidine.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Amend the rule to identify amino acids with side chains containing nitrogen, sulfur, or oxygen atoms that can coordinate with metal centers.
    - Consider steric factors by evaluating the side chain's ability to reach and interact with the catalyst, possibly excluding bulky amino acids where coordination is hindered.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Enhanced rule coverage and accuracy by recognizing more amino acids that can lead to high yield due to their coordinating side chains.

- **Advice 3**: **Adjust Rule 8 to limit the scope of fluorination and incorporate electronic considerations.**
  - **Action**: Specify that only modifiers with highly fluorinated long aliphatic chains (e.g., perfluorinated chains with more than four fluorine atoms) lead to low yield.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Modify the SMARTS pattern to detect modifiers with extensive fluorination (e.g., perfluoroalkyl groups) and exclude those with minimal or strategically placed fluorine atoms.
    - Include considerations of how fluorination affects electron density at the carboxyl group, potentially incorporating partial charge calculations if feasible.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Reduced false negatives and improved specificity by accurately identifying modifiers where fluorination truly impacts yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Update Rule 10 to increase specificity by refining the structural criteria for aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups.**
  - **Action**: Ensure Rule 10 applies only to aromatic carboxylic acids with the aldehyde group in positions that interfere with metal coordination, particularly ortho to the carboxyl group.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Adjust the SMARTS pattern to detect aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxyl group on the aromatic ring.
    - Exclude modifiers where the aldehyde group is positioned away from coordination sites or where steric hindrance is minimal.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Improved accuracy by correctly classifying modifiers that negatively impact yield due to specific structural arrangements.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance SMARTS patterns and rule definitions for greater precision and reduced misclassifications.**
  - **Action**: Review and refine all SMARTS patterns used in the rules to ensure they precisely capture the intended functional groups and structural motifs.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Utilize validated SMARTS patterns from reliable cheminformatics resources and databases.
    - Test the patterns against known compounds to verify correct matches and adjust as necessary.
    - Incorporate recursive SMARTS or atom mapping where complex structures require more detailed patterns.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Fewer false positives and negatives due to improved pattern accuracy, leading to better rule performance.

- **Advice 6**: **Balance rule specificity and coverage by merging similar rules and broadening applicability where appropriate.**
  - **Action**: Identify rules with overlapping criteria and consider combining them to simplify the rule set and increase dataset coverage.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Analyze the existing rules for common features or structural motifs that can be grouped.
    - Adjust rules to be inclusive of modifiers that share key functional groups but may differ in minor substituents.
    - Ensure that the confidence and lift of the combined rules remain acceptable.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Enhanced rule coverage without significant loss of confidence, leading to a more robust and comprehensive rule set.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate additional molecular descriptors into the rules to account for electronic and steric factors.**
  - **Action**: Use quantitative molecular descriptors such as partial charges, steric hindrance indices, and coordination numbers to refine the rules.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Integrate software tools that calculate molecular properties relevant to coordination and reactivity (e.g., Mulliken charges, van der Waals volumes).
    - Include these descriptors as criteria within the rules, setting thresholds based on observed yield outcomes.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Enhanced ability to predict yields by considering deeper molecular characteristics beyond functional group presence.

- **Advice 8**: **Re-evaluate the model by testing alternative algorithms and employing robust cross-validation.**
  - **Action**: Experiment with different machine learning models that may better capture nonlinear relationships, such as random forests or gradient boosting.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Train alternative models using the existing dataset and compare performance metrics to the current model.
    - Apply k-fold cross-validation to assess model generalizability and prevent overfitting.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Improved predictive performance and validation accuracy, leading to more reliable yield predictions.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids can coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers without steric hindrance or electronic interference from other functional groups. The simple structure allows for optimal interaction with the catalyst, enhancing its activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups.)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂), hydroxyl (–OH), or thiol (–SH) groups at the alpha (α), beta (β), or gamma (γ) positions lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups near the carboxyl group can chelate the metal centers in the catalyst, forming stable complexes. This chelation enhances the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group beyond γ position.)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups at positions beyond the gamma (γ) position (i.e., delta (δ) position or further) lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups located too far from the carboxyl group are less effective in forming strong chelation with the metal centers. The increased distance reduces the coordination efficiency, diminishing the modifier's ability to enhance the catalyst.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups, such as amino (–NH₂), nitro (–NO₂), or bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups at the para position can enhance metal coordination and electron delocalization. This increases the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's active sites, promoting higher catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating and non-coordinating.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating or non-coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups can reduce the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with the metal centers by increasing electron density, which may hinder effective interaction. Non-coordinating groups do not provide additional sites for metal binding.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity. The direct attachment of the carboxyl group ensures effective positioning for coordination, improving catalytic performance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Carboxyl group attached to benzene ring, not directly to the heteroaromatic ring.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages in their structure lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and may prevent optimal alignment of coordinating groups with the catalyst's active sites. They can also increase steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of coordination and catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with polyether chains or multiple ether linkages.)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that have highly fluorinated aliphatic chains lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorinated chains are strongly electron-withdrawing, which can reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group by withdrawing electron density. Additionally, fluorinated compounds may not interact favorably with the catalyst's surface due to hydrophobic interactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide numerous sites for hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst. This enhances the overall interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, promoting higher catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating functional groups, such as indole nitrogen in tryptophan, lead to **high yield**; those without such groups or with non-coordinating side chains lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Side chains with coordinating functional groups enhance interaction with metal centers in the catalyst, improving catalytic performance. Amino acids lacking such groups do not provide additional coordination sites and are less effective modifiers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative with indole nitrogen.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenylalanine derivative without coordinating heteroatoms.)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Lysine derivative with amide group reducing coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol (–SH) groups at the alpha (α), beta (β), or gamma (γ) positions lead to **high yield**; aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aliphatic acids, thiol groups near the carboxylate can strongly coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, steric hindrance and electronic factors may reduce the effectiveness of thiol groups in coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids or possess multiple carboxyl groups close together lead to **high yield**; those with additional interfering functional groups may lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple carboxyl groups can enhance coordination with metal centers due to increased binding sites. However, functional groups like ketones adjacent to carboxyl groups may interfere with coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(False)* *(Ketone group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form undesired complexes with the catalyst, interfering with metal coordination and reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with aromatic aldehyde carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with substituents that increase steric hindrance near the coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near the coordinating sites can prevent effective interaction with the catalyst's metal centers by hindering access, thus reducing the modifier's ability to enhance the reaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Steric hindrance from methylsulfanyl group.)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky benzoyl group adjacent to coordinating sites.)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (–OH) groups on the aromatic ring but without additional chain extension lead to **low yield**; extended chain analogs may lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or lead to unfavorable electronic effects, reducing coordination efficiency. Extension of the chain can mitigate these effects by distancing the hydroxyl group from the coordination site.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Extended chain reduces interference.)*

These rules capture the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the reaction yield. By combining multiple sub-structures and considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron density, steric hindrance, and functional group effects, the rules provide a comprehensive framework for predicting whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield in the reaction.

The rules balance simplicity and complexity to cover a broad range of the dataset:

- **Simple Rules with High Coverage**: Rules 1, 2, 3, and 4 cover fundamental structural features affecting yield.
- **Complex Rules with Specific Applications**: Rules 10, 11, and 15 address more intricate combinations of functional groups and their positions.

This set of 15 rules should aid in the selection and design of molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction yield for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* lacks sufficient coverage, as it is supported by only one data point—**octanoic acid**. While the rule is clear and provides reasonable property insight about simple aliphatic carboxylic acids leading to high yield, more supporting examples are needed to strengthen its validity according to the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* is strong in terms of clarity and property insight, clearly stating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups at α, β, or γ positions lead to high yield. It has good complexity by considering both functional groups and their positions. The rule is well-supported by multiple high-yield examples (**(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**, **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**, etc.) and low-yield examples when the functional groups are beyond the γ position, demonstrating excellent coverage and balance.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* is clear and provides adequate property insight into why functional groups beyond the γ position lead to low yield. It considers the combination of functional group type and position (complexity) and is supported by multiple low-yield examples (**7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, etc.), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* offers clear guidance on aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups leading to high yield. The rule has strong property insight regarding electron effects on coordination and is supported by sufficient high-yield examples (**4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, etc.) and low-yield contrasts, achieving good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* effectively contrasts with Rule 4 by focusing on electron-donating or non-coordinating groups leading to low yield. The clarity is excellent, and the property insight is logical. It is supported by adequate examples (**4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* is clear and provides good property insight into the coordination abilities of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids. It has appropriate complexity and is well-supported by high-yield examples (**pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* clearly states that modifiers with polyether chains lead to low yield, with logical property insight about steric hindrance and flexibility affecting coordination. It is supported by at least two low-yield examples (**2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* is clear and provides reasonable property insight into why highly fluorinated chains lead to low yield. It is supported by sufficient examples (**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* is clear and offers good property insight into the benefits of polyhydroxylated acids. It is supported by multiple high-yield examples (**(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**, **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**). While there are no low-yield examples, the coverage of high-yield modifiers meets the requirements.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* provides clear distinctions between amino acids with coordinating side chains leading to high yield and those without leading to low yield. The property insight is sound. However, the coverage is limited on the high-yield side with only one supporting example (**(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**), slightly weakening the rule's validity.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* is clear and has acceptable property insight about the effectiveness of thiol groups in aliphatic versus aromatic acids. Coverage is limited, with only one high-yield (**3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**) and one low-yield (**4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) example, suggesting a need for more data points to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* clearly explains the impact of multiple carboxyl groups and interfering functional groups on yield. It has good complexity and is supported by multiple high-yield examples (**(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**, **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**) and a low-yield example (**4-oxoheptanedioic acid**), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* is clear and provides logical property insight. However, coverage is limited to a single low-yield example (**4-formylbenzoic acid**), which is insufficient according to the criteria, indicating a need for additional supporting data.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* addresses steric hindrance near coordinating groups leading to low yield. While the rule is somewhat general, it is reasonable and supported by two low-yield examples (**2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**). Coverage could be improved with more examples.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* highlights the effect of chain length in aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups. The rule is clear and offers good property insight. However, coverage is limited with one high-yield (**5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**) and one low-yield (**3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**) example, suggesting the need for additional data to strengthen the rule.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids can coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers without steric hindrance or electronic interference from other functional groups. The simple structure allows for optimal interaction with the catalyst, enhancing its activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups.)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂), hydroxyl (–OH), or thiol (–SH) groups at the alpha (α), beta (β), or gamma (γ) positions lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups near the carboxyl group can chelate the metal centers in the catalyst, forming stable complexes. This chelation enhances the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group beyond γ position.)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups at positions beyond the gamma (γ) position (i.e., delta (δ) position or further) lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups located too far from the carboxyl group are less effective in forming strong chelation with the metal centers. The increased distance reduces the coordination efficiency, diminishing the modifier's ability to enhance the catalyst.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups, such as amino (–NH₂), nitro (–NO₂), or bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups at the para position can enhance metal coordination and electron delocalization. This increases the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's active sites, promoting higher catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating and non-coordinating.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating or non-coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups can reduce the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with the metal centers by increasing electron density, which may hinder effective interaction. Non-coordinating groups do not provide additional sites for metal binding.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity. The direct attachment of the carboxyl group ensures effective positioning for coordination, improving catalytic performance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Carboxyl group attached to benzene ring, not directly to the heteroaromatic ring.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages in their structure lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and may prevent optimal alignment of coordinating groups with the catalyst's active sites. They can also increase steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of coordination and catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with polyether chains or multiple ether linkages.)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that have highly fluorinated aliphatic chains lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorinated chains are strongly electron-withdrawing, which can reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group by withdrawing electron density. Additionally, fluorinated compounds may not interact favorably with the catalyst's surface due to hydrophobic interactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide numerous sites for hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst. This enhances the overall interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, promoting higher catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating functional groups, such as indole nitrogen in tryptophan, lead to **high yield**; those without such groups or with non-coordinating side chains lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Side chains with coordinating functional groups enhance interaction with metal centers in the catalyst, improving catalytic performance. Amino acids lacking such groups do not provide additional coordination sites and are less effective modifiers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative with indole nitrogen.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenylalanine derivative without coordinating heteroatoms.)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Lysine derivative with amide group reducing coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol (–SH) groups at the alpha (α), beta (β), or gamma (γ) positions lead to **high yield**; aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aliphatic acids, thiol groups near the carboxylate can strongly coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, steric hindrance and electronic factors may reduce the effectiveness of thiol groups in coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids or possess multiple carboxyl groups close together lead to **high yield**; those with additional interfering functional groups may lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple carboxyl groups can enhance coordination with metal centers due to increased binding sites. However, functional groups like ketones adjacent to carboxyl groups may interfere with coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(False)* *(Ketone group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form undesired complexes with the catalyst, interfering with metal coordination and reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with aromatic aldehyde carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with substituents that increase steric hindrance near the coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near the coordinating sites can prevent effective interaction with the catalyst's metal centers by hindering access, thus reducing the modifier's ability to enhance the reaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Steric hindrance from methylsulfanyl group.)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky benzoyl group adjacent to coordinating sites.)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (–OH) groups on the aromatic ring but without additional chain extension lead to **low yield**; extended chain analogs may lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or lead to unfavorable electronic effects, reducing coordination efficiency. Extension of the chain can mitigate these effects by distancing the hydroxyl group from the coordination site.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Extended chain reduces interference.)*

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules capture the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the reaction yield. By combining multiple sub-structures and considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron density, steric hindrance, and functional group effects, the rules provide a comprehensive framework for predicting whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield in the reaction.

The rules balance simplicity and complexity to cover a broad range of the dataset:

- **Simple Rules with High Coverage**: Rules 1, 2, 3, and 4 cover fundamental structural features affecting yield.
- **Complex Rules with Specific Applications**: Rules 10, 11, and 15 address more intricate combinations of functional groups and their positions.

This set of 15 rules should aid in the selection and design of molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction yield for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Modify the 'exclude_patterns' in Rule 1 to avoid incorrectly excluding the carboxylic acid group due to the hydroxyl oxygen.**

  - *Issue*: The current pattern `[OX2H]` in the 'hydroxyl_group' exclude pattern matches the hydroxyl oxygen in the carboxylic acid group, causing all carboxylic acids to be excluded.

  - *Improvement*: Modify the 'hydroxyl_group' exclude pattern to exclude only hydroxyl groups **not attached to a carbonyl carbon**. Use the SMARTS pattern `'[OX2H][!$([CX3](=O))]'` to match hydroxyl groups not directly bonded to a carbonyl carbon, thereby excluding additional hydroxyl groups while retaining the carboxylic acid's hydroxyl.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Adjust the 'thiol_group' and 'amino_group' exclude patterns in Rule 1 to ensure they don't exclude essential functional groups in carboxylic acids or amides.**

  - *Thiol Group*:

    - *Issue*: While thiol groups are not part of carboxylic acids, ensure the pattern `'[SX2H]'` doesn't inadvertently match other sulfur-containing functional groups that are acceptable.

    - *Improvement*: Specify the thiol exclude pattern to target thiol groups not adjacent to carbonyl carbons, if relevant.

  - *Amino Group*:

    - *Issue*: The exclude pattern `'[NX3;H2,H1;!$(NC=O)]'` correctly excludes primary and secondary amines but may need refinement to prevent incorrect exclusions.

    - *Improvement*: Verify that this pattern does not exclude amide linkages or nitrogen atoms that are part of acceptable functional groups in the context of Rule 1.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Review and refine the SMARTS patterns for all rules to ensure they accurately reflect the structural descriptions in the natural language rules.**

  - *Issue*: Some patterns may not fully capture the intended structures, leading to incorrect matches or misses.

  - *Improvement*: For each rule, cross-validate the SMARTS patterns with known examples and counter-examples from the dataset to ensure accurate representation. For instance, in Rule 2, confirm that the patterns correctly identify alpha, beta, and gamma substitutions.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Include tests or validation steps within the code to catch potential mismatches between the rules and their SMARTS implementations.**

  - *Issue*: Without validation, errors in pattern definitions may go unnoticed.

  - *Improvement*: Implement unit tests using known compounds that should match or not match each rule. This can help identify errors in SMARTS patterns early in development.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Consider using recursive SMARTS patterns or more specific atomic environmental definitions to improve pattern accuracy.**

  - *Issue*: Simple linear SMARTS patterns may not capture complex or branched structures accurately.

  - *Improvement*: Enhance SMARTS patterns by incorporating recursive definitions, atom property specifications, and explicit stereochemistry where relevant.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Document each SMARTS pattern with comments explaining the intended match to improve code readability and maintainability.**

  - *Issue*: Complex SMARTS patterns can be difficult to understand and debug without sufficient documentation.

  - *Improvement*: Add detailed comments next to each SMARTS pattern explaining which structural feature it represents and any nuances in its definition.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Verify the exclusion of functional groups in 'exclude_patterns' doesn't lead to unintentional exclusion of valid molecules by thoroughly testing with edge cases.**

  - *Issue*: Overly broad exclusion patterns may inadvertently exclude valid modifiers.

  - *Improvement*: Refine exclusion patterns to be as specific as possible, perhaps by specifying the context in which a functional group should be excluded.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Update the code to handle tautomers, stereochemistry, and protonation states where relevant, as these can affect substructure matching.**

  - *Issue*: Molecules may exist in different tautomeric or protonation states that affect SMARTS matching.

  - *Improvement*: Use canonical representations or include multiple forms of a functional group in the patterns to ensure accurate matching.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Ensure consistency in how functional groups are defined across different rules to avoid conflicts or overlaps.**

  - *Issue*: Inconsistent definitions may lead to a molecule matching multiple rules incorrectly.

  - *Improvement*: Create a centralized set of SMARTS definitions for common functional groups used across multiple rules.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids can coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers without steric hindrance or electronic interference from other functional groups. The simple structure allows for optimal interaction with the catalyst, enhancing its activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups.)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂), hydroxyl (–OH), or thiol (–SH) groups at the alpha (α), beta (β), or gamma (γ) positions lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups near the carboxyl group can chelate the metal centers in the catalyst, forming stable complexes. This chelation enhances the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group beyond γ position.)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups at positions beyond the gamma (γ) position (i.e., delta (δ) position or further) lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups located too far from the carboxyl group are less effective in forming strong chelation with the metal centers. The increased distance reduces the coordination efficiency, diminishing the modifier's ability to enhance the catalyst.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups, such as amino (–NH₂), nitro (–NO₂), or bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups at the para position can enhance metal coordination and electron delocalization. This increases the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's active sites, promoting higher catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating and non-coordinating.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating or non-coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups can reduce the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with the metal centers by increasing electron density, which may hinder effective interaction. Non-coordinating groups do not provide additional sites for metal binding.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity. The direct attachment of the carboxyl group ensures effective positioning for coordination, improving catalytic performance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Carboxyl group attached to benzene ring, not directly to the heteroaromatic ring.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages in their structure lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and may prevent optimal alignment of coordinating groups with the catalyst's active sites. They can also increase steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of coordination and catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with polyether chains or multiple ether linkages.)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that have highly fluorinated aliphatic chains lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorinated chains are strongly electron-withdrawing, which can reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group by withdrawing electron density. Additionally, fluorinated compounds may not interact favorably with the catalyst's surface due to hydrophobic interactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide numerous sites for hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst. This enhances the overall interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, promoting higher catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating functional groups, such as indole nitrogen in tryptophan, lead to **high yield**; those without such groups or with non-coordinating side chains lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Side chains with coordinating functional groups enhance interaction with metal centers in the catalyst, improving catalytic performance. Amino acids lacking such groups do not provide additional coordination sites and are less effective modifiers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative with indole nitrogen.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenylalanine derivative without coordinating heteroatoms.)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Lysine derivative with amide group reducing coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol (–SH) groups at the alpha (α), beta (β), or gamma (γ) positions lead to **high yield**; aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aliphatic acids, thiol groups near the carboxylate can strongly coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, steric hindrance and electronic factors may reduce the effectiveness of thiol groups in coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids or possess multiple carboxyl groups close together lead to **high yield**; those with additional interfering functional groups may lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple carboxyl groups can enhance coordination with metal centers due to increased binding sites. However, functional groups like ketones adjacent to carboxyl groups may interfere with coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(False)* *(Ketone group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form undesired complexes with the catalyst, interfering with metal coordination and reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with aromatic aldehyde carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with substituents that increase steric hindrance near the coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near the coordinating sites can prevent effective interaction with the catalyst's metal centers by hindering access, thus reducing the modifier's ability to enhance the reaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Steric hindrance from methylsulfanyl group.)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky benzoyl group adjacent to coordinating sites.)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (–OH) groups on the aromatic ring but without additional chain extension lead to **low yield**; extended chain analogs may lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or lead to unfavorable electronic effects, reducing coordination efficiency. Extension of the chain can mitigate these effects by distancing the hydroxyl group from the coordination site.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Extended chain reduces interference.)*

By combining multiple sub-structures and considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron density, steric hindrance, and functional group effects, the rules provide a comprehensive framework for predicting whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield in the reaction.

The rules balance simplicity and complexity to cover a broad range of the dataset:

- **Simple Rules with High Coverage**: Rules 1, 2, 3, and 4 cover fundamental structural features affecting yield.
- **Complex Rules with Specific Applications**: Rules 10, 11, and 15 address more intricate combinations of functional groups and their positions.

This set of 15 rules should aid in the selection and design of molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction yield for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 1**, the SMARTS pattern is too specific, matching only a 7-carbon chain aliphatic carboxylic acid. Modify the pattern to match any simple aliphatic carboxylic acid without additional functional groups, regardless of chain length. Use a pattern like `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0][CH2][CH2]*[CH3]'` or even more generally `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0][C;H2][C;H2]*[C;H3]'` to accommodate varying chain lengths.
  
- ** Suggestion 2 **: For **Rule 2**, the patterns are highly specific and only match certain chain lengths and positions. Generalize the patterns to match any aliphatic carboxylic acid with amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups at the α, β, or γ positions, irrespective of the total chain length. Use variables in SMARTS to denote positions relative to the carboxyl group, possibly using recursive SMARTS or atom mapping.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Re-evaluate all SMARTS patterns to ensure they capture the essence of the natural language rules without being overly restrictive. For instance, instead of specifying exact substitutions or chain lengths, use wildcard characters or more general substructure definitions.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: In the **exclude_patterns** for **Rule 1** and other rules, verify that they are not unintentionally excluding valid molecules. For example, the pattern `'[!#6;!#1]'` may exclude molecules containing heteroatoms anywhere in the structure, which might be too broad.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Implement positive and negative control tests for each rule using known high-yield and low-yield examples from the dataset to validate that the SMARTS patterns correctly identify them.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Utilize standard functional group definitions or SMARTS patterns from trusted libraries (like RDKit's predefined functional groups) to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness in pattern matching.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For **Rule 11**, which involves different predictions based on whether the thiol group is in an aliphatic or aromatic acid, explicitly separate the patterns and ensure that the predictions (`1` for aliphatic, `-1` for aromatic) are correctly assigned in the code.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Use more flexible SMARTS patterns by incorporating repetition operators (like `*` for zero or more repetitions) and recursive SMARTS to capture a broader range of applicable structures without over-generalizing.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Review and correct any syntax errors or misused symbols in the SMARTS patterns, as these can prevent correct substructure matching. For instance, ensure that atom and bond specifications are correctly defined and that ring closures and branching are properly notated.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Consider adding comments or documentation within the code to explain the intent of each SMARTS pattern, making it easier to review and modify them in the future.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids can coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers without steric hindrance or electronic interference from other functional groups. The simple structure allows for optimal interaction with the catalyst, enhancing its activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups.)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂), hydroxyl (–OH), or thiol (–SH) groups at the alpha (α), beta (β), or gamma (γ) positions lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups near the carboxyl group can chelate the metal centers in the catalyst, forming stable complexes. This chelation enhances the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group beyond γ position.)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups at positions beyond the gamma (γ) position (i.e., delta (δ) position or further) lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups located too far from the carboxyl group are less effective in forming strong chelation with the metal centers. The increased distance reduces the coordination efficiency, diminishing the modifier's ability to enhance the catalyst.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups, such as amino (–NH₂), nitro (–NO₂), or bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups at the para position can enhance metal coordination and electron delocalization. This increases the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's active sites, promoting higher catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating and non-coordinating.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating or non-coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups can reduce the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with the metal centers by increasing electron density, which may hinder effective interaction. Non-coordinating groups do not provide additional sites for metal binding.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity. The direct attachment of the carboxyl group ensures effective positioning for coordination, improving catalytic performance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Carboxyl group attached to benzene ring, not directly to the heteroaromatic ring.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages in their structure lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and may prevent optimal alignment of coordinating groups with the catalyst's active sites. They can also increase steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of coordination and catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with polyether chains or multiple ether linkages.)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that have highly fluorinated aliphatic chains lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorinated chains are strongly electron-withdrawing, which can reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group by withdrawing electron density. Additionally, fluorinated compounds may not interact favorably with the catalyst's surface due to hydrophobic interactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide numerous sites for hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst. This enhances the overall interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, promoting higher catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating functional groups, such as indole nitrogen in tryptophan, lead to **high yield**; those without such groups or with non-coordinating side chains lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Side chains with coordinating functional groups enhance interaction with metal centers in the catalyst, improving catalytic performance. Amino acids lacking such groups do not provide additional coordination sites and are less effective modifiers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative with indole nitrogen.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenylalanine derivative without coordinating heteroatoms.)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Lysine derivative with amide group reducing coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol (–SH) groups at the alpha (α), beta (β), or gamma (γ) positions lead to **high yield**; aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aliphatic acids, thiol groups near the carboxylate can strongly coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, steric hindrance and electronic factors may reduce the effectiveness of thiol groups in coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids or possess multiple carboxyl groups close together lead to **high yield**; those with additional interfering functional groups may lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple carboxyl groups can enhance coordination with metal centers due to increased binding sites. However, functional groups like ketones adjacent to carboxyl groups may interfere with coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(False)* *(Ketone group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form undesired complexes with the catalyst, interfering with metal coordination and reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with aromatic aldehyde carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with substituents that increase steric hindrance near the coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near the coordinating sites can prevent effective interaction with the catalyst's metal centers by hindering access, thus reducing the modifier's ability to enhance the reaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Steric hindrance from methylsulfanyl group.)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky benzoyl group adjacent to coordinating sites.)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (–OH) groups on the aromatic ring but without additional chain extension lead to **low yield**; extended chain analogs may lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or lead to unfavorable electronic effects, reducing coordination efficiency. Extension of the chain can mitigate these effects by distancing the hydroxyl group from the coordination site.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Extended chain reduces interference.)*

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules capture the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the reaction yield. By combining multiple sub-structures and considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron density, steric hindrance, and functional group effects, the rules provide a comprehensive framework for predicting whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield in the reaction.

The rules balance simplicity and complexity to cover a broad range of the dataset:

- **Simple Rules with High Coverage**: Rules 1, 2, 3, and 4 cover fundamental structural features affecting yield.
- **Complex Rules with Specific Applications**: Rules 10, 11, and 15 address more intricate combinations of functional groups and their positions.

This set of 15 rules should aid in the selection and design of molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction yield for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **For Rule 1**, the SMARTS pattern provided does not match simple aliphatic carboxylic acids like octanoic acid (`CCCCCCCC(=O)O`). The current pattern `[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][C;H2][C;H2]*[C;H3]` is too restrictive and may not match longer chains or variations. **Improve the pattern** by generalizing it to match any aliphatic chain without additional functional groups:

  ```python
  '[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][C;H2]*[C;H3]'
  ```
  
  Additionally, **remove or adjust the exclude pattern**. The current exclude pattern `'[!#6;!#1]'` excludes any molecule containing atoms other than carbon and hydrogen, but it is incorrectly applied. Instead, **use a function to check for the absence of heteroatoms**:

  ```python
  def contains_only_C_and_H(mol):
      for atom in mol.GetAtoms():
          if atom.GetAtomicNum() not in (1, 6):  # Hydrogen and Carbon
              return False
      return True
  ```

  Include this check in the code to ensure that only molecules with carbon and hydrogen are matched for Rule 1.

- **Suggestion 2**: **For Rule 2**, the SMARTS patterns do not adequately capture all aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups at α, β, or γ positions. The patterns are too specific and may miss valid molecules. **Revise the patterns** to generalize the position of the functional groups relative to the carboxylic acid:

  ```python
  '[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][C;!$(C=O)]{0,3}[C;!$(C=O)]{0,3}[NX3H2,NX3H1,NX3H0,OX2H,SX2H]'
  ```

  This pattern allows for the functional group to be at α, β, or γ positions by permitting up to three carbon atoms between the carboxyl group and the functional group.

- **Suggestion 3**: **For Rule 3**, ensure that the pattern correctly identifies amino or hydroxyl groups beyond the γ position. The current pattern may not accurately capture all cases. **Adjust the pattern** to:

  ```python
  '[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][C;!$(C=O)]{3,}[C;!$(C=O)]{0,}[NX3H2,NX3H1,NX3H0,OX2H]'
  ```

  This pattern specifies that the functional group must be at least four carbons away from the carboxyl group (beyond γ position).

- **Suggestion 4**: **For Rule 4 and Rule 5**, the SMARTS patterns are too specific, matching only the examples provided. **Create generalized patterns** to identify para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups:

  **Rule 4 (High Yield)**:

  ```python
  'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)[NX3H2]',  # Amino group at para position
  'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)[N+](=O)[O-]',  # Nitro group at para position
  'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)CBr'  # Bromomethyl group at para position
  ```

  **Generalized Pattern**:

  ```python
  'c1cc([#7,#8,#16,F,Cl,Br,I,$(C(=O)[#6])]ccc1C(=O)O)'
  ```

  **Rule 5 (Low Yield)**:

  ```python
  'c1cc([CH3,O,P,S,R,#15]ccc1C(=O)O)'
  ```

  This generalized pattern matches para-substituted groups with electron-donating or non-coordinating properties.

- **Suggestion 5**: **For Rule 6**, the patterns should capture any nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acid with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring. **Generalize the pattern**:

  ```python
  '[nH]1cccc1C(=O)O',  # Generic pattern for heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen
  'n1cccc1C(=O)O',     # Pyridine carboxylic acid
  'n1ccncc1C(=O)O'     # Pyrazine carboxylic acid
  ```

  Ensure that the SMARTS patterns cover various heteroaromatic systems.

- **Suggestion 6**: **For Rule 7**, identify polyether chains more effectively by searching for multiple ether linkages. **Improve the pattern**:

  ```python
  '[OX2H0][CH2][OX2H0][CH2][OX2H0][CH2]',  # At least three ether linkages
  ```

  Add this substructure to the molecule and check if it leads to low yield predictions.

- **Suggestion 7**: **For Rule 8**, the pattern should match any aliphatic chain with multiple fluorine atoms, especially perfluorinated chains. **Generalize the pattern**:

  ```python
  '[CX4]([CF3])([CF3])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]',  # Highly fluorinated adjacent to carboxylic acid
  '[C;H2][C;H2][C](F)(F)F'  # Fluorinated aliphatic chain
  ```

- **Suggestion 8**: **For Rule 9**, the pattern should match any polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acid (sugar acids). **Use a more general pattern**:

  ```python
  '[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][C;H]([OX2H])[C;H]([OX2H])[C;H]([OX2H])[C;H]([OX2H])[C;H]([OX2H])',  # Matches sugar acids
  ```

- **Suggestion 9**: **For Rule 10**, distinguish between amino acids with coordinating side chains and those without. **Create separate patterns and predictions**:

  **High Yield (Coordinating Side Chains)**:

  ```python
  '[NX3;H2][C@@H](C(=O)O)CC1=CC=CN1'  # Tryptophan-like structures
  ```

  **Low Yield (Non-Coordinating Side Chains)**:

  ```python
  '[NX3;H2][C@@H](C(=O)O)CC[C@H](C)C(=O)O'  # Non-coordinating amino acids
  ```

- **Suggestion 10**: **For Rule 11**, clarify the distinction between aliphatic and aromatic acids with thiol groups. **Use separate patterns for each**:

  **High Yield (Aliphatic Thiol)**:

  ```python
  '[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][CX4][CX4][CX4][SX2H]'  # Thiol at γ position
  ```

  **Low Yield (Aromatic Thiol)**:

  ```python
  'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O[SX2H]'  # Aromatic carboxylic acid with thiol group
  ```

- **Suggestion 11**: **For Rule 13**, the current pattern only matches 4-formylbenzoic acid. **Generalize the pattern** to match any aromatic carboxylic acid with an aldehyde group:

  ```python
  'c1ccc(cc1C(=O)O)[CX3H]=O'  # Aromatic ring with carboxylic acid and aldehyde substitution
  ```

- **Suggestion 12**: **For Rule 14**, to detect steric hindrance near coordinating groups, **identify bulky substituents adjacent to functional groups**:

  ```python
  '[C;R0](C(=O)O)[N;R0]([C;R0])[C;R0]'  # Amine with adjacent bulky groups
  ```

  **Enhance the pattern** by including common bulky groups like methyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl.

- **Suggestion 13**: **For all rules**, avoid using specific molecule examples as SMARTS patterns. **Generalize the SMARTS to capture the structural essence** of each rule. Utilize wildcard atoms, recursive SMARTS, and properties like atom degrees, hybridization, and connectivity to make the patterns more inclusive.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Implement extensive testing** of each SMARTS pattern against a variety of molecules, including both positive and negative examples from the dataset. This ensures that the patterns accurately reflect the intended rules.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Use RDKit's chemical features and descriptors** in combination with SMARTS to improve pattern recognition. For example, use methods to identify ring systems, functional group counts, and atom properties that may be challenging to capture with SMARTS alone.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Evaluation of Effectiveness:**

- **Previous Accuracy Metrics:**
  - **Validation Accuracy:** Consistently around **76%** in previous iterations.
    - Examples:
      - `[0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]`
      - `[0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]`
  - **Test Accuracy:** Ranging from **62.5%** to **75%**.

- **Current Accuracy Metrics:**
  - **Latest Validation Accuracy:** **48.57%**.
    - This is a significant decrease from previous validation accuracies.
  - **Observation:** The sharp decline indicates that the current rules are less effective than before.

**2. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

- **Underfitting Indication:**
  - The model's accuracy has dropped below random chance (which is 50% for binary classification).
  - This suggests that the model is **underfitting** the data.
  - The model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
- **Possible Causes:**
  - **Over-simplification of Rules:**
    - Reduction in the number of effective rules contributing to predictions.
  - **Loss of Important Features:**
    - Key features (rules) that previously improved accuracy may have been modified or removed.

**3. Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values:**

- **Dominance of Rule 4:**
  - In the latest SHAP analysis, only **Rule 4** is contributing to the model's predictions.
  - SHAP values for other rules are either zero or not present.
- **Underestimation Instances:**
  - Many molecules where the **predicted loading is low** but the **experimental value is high**.
    - **Rule 4** has a negative SHAP value in these cases.
    - Example Molecules:
      - **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
      - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**
      - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N**
  - The negative SHAP value indicates that **Rule 4** is pushing the prediction towards a low loading when it should be high.
- **Overestimation Instances:**
  - Fewer or no instances where the **predicted loading is high** but the **experimental value is low**.
  - This imbalance suggests a bias in the model towards predicting low loading.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

- **Accuracy Degradation:**
  - The model's accuracy decreased from around **76%** to **48.57%**.
  - The reduction indicates that the rules have not improved the model.
- **Lack of Improvement:**
  - The model has not reached a local minimum in terms of error reduction.
  - Further iterations and refinements are necessary.

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- **Rule 4's Problematic Influence:**
  - Negative SHAP values for Rule 4 in underestimation cases highlight it as a potential issue.
  - It may be incorrectly influencing the model to predict low loading.
- **Absence of Other Rules:**
  - Previously, rules like **Rule 1, Rule 2, Rule 3, Rule 6, Rule 8,** and **Rule 10** contributed to predictions.
  - Their absence suggests a loss of important predictive features.
- **Model's Predictive Patterns:**
  - The model seems to default to predicting low loading for most molecules.
  - This lack of variability is characteristic of underfitting.

**Performance Summary:**

- **Effectiveness:** The current rules are not effective; they fail to accurately predict the modifier loadings.
- **Underfitting:** The model is underfitting, likely due to oversimplification of rules and omission of critical features.
- **Discrepancies:** Negative SHAP values for Rule 4 in underestimated loadings suggest that Rule 4 may be misconfigured.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rule 4:**

- **Issue Identification:**
  - Rule 4 is contributing negatively when high loading is expected.
- **Proposed Adjustments:**
  - **Re-express Rule 4** to better distinguish between modifiers leading to high and low yields.
    - **Current Rule 4:**
      - Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups (e.g., –NH₂, –NO₂, –CH₂Br) lead to high yield.
    - **Potential Issues with Rule 4:**
      - It might be too broad or misclassifying certain substituents.
  - **Action Steps:**

  - **Rule 1 (Simple Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids):**
    - Ensure this rule captures modifiers that lead to high yield due to lack of steric hindrance.
  - **Rule 2 (Aliphatic Acids with α, β, γ Functional Groups):**
    - Refine to accurately identify coordinating functional groups.
  - **Rule 3 (Functional Groups Beyond γ Position):**
    - Adjust to prevent misclassification of modifiers with distant functional groups.
  - **Rule 6 (Nitrogen-Containing Heteroaromatic Acids):**
    - Reassess to include effective modifiers and exclude ineffective ones.
  - **Rule 8 (Highly Fluorinated Chains):**
    - Verify that it correctly predicts low yield for perfluorinated modifiers.
- **Action Steps:**
  - Re-add these rules to the feature matrix.
  - Fine-tune conditions within each rule based on SHAP feedback.

**3. Address Overfitting/Underfitting:**

- **Increase Model Complexity:**
  - Introduce additional rules to capture more nuanced patterns.
- **Avoid Oversimplification:**
  - Ensure that rules are not too general, which can lead to underfitting.
- **Balance Bias and Variance:**

  - Identify which rules consistently contribute to underestimations.
- **Adjust Problematic Rules:**
  - Modify rules with high negative SHAP values in instances of underestimation.
- **Iterative Refinement:**
  - Continuously update the rules based on SHAP feedback until discrepancies are minimized.

**5. Expand Rule Set Based on Misclassified Molecules:**

- **Analyze Misclassifications:**
  - Examine molecules that are consistently misclassified to identify missing patterns.
- **Develop New Rules:**
  - Create rules that capture structural features not currently considered.
- **Example:**
  - If certain modifiers with specific heterocycles are misclassified, consider adding a rule to address them.

**6. Enhance Feature Representation:**

- **Consider Quantitative Descriptors:**
  - Supplement the rules with molecular descriptors (e.g., electron density, steric hindrance indices).
- **Incorporate Machine Learning Features:**
  - Use methods like principal component analysis (PCA) to capture complex patterns.

**7. Re-express Problematic Rules:**

- **Rule 4 Rewriting Example:**
  - **Original Rule 4:**
    - Aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups lead to high yield.
  - **Revised Rule 4:**
    - Aromatic carboxylic acids with **specific** para-substituted coordinating groups (e.g., –NH₂), but excluding certain groups (e.g., –NO₂), lead to high yield.
    - Provide clarity on which substituents are beneficial.

**8. Validate Rule Changes with Domain Expertise:**

- **Consult Chemical Knowledge:**
  - Ensure that rule adjustments are chemically plausible.
- **Collaborate with Chemists:**
  - Work with experts to understand the underlying chemistry of misclassified modifiers.

**Summary of Recommendations:**

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization**

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has shown a significant decrease in performance metrics. The train support has decreased considerably, indicating that the rules are becoming too specific and are covering a smaller portion of the dataset. The validation accuracy has dropped from approximately 76% to 48.57%, which is below random chance for binary classification. This suggests that the model is underfitting the data and failing to capture the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Generalize SMARTS Patterns**:
   - **Rule 1**: The current SMARTS pattern for simple aliphatic carboxylic acids may be too restrictive. Broaden the pattern to match a wider range of aliphatic chains without additional functional groups. Ensure that it includes various chain lengths and branching patterns, capturing all relevant simple aliphatic carboxylic acids.
   - **Rule 2**: Revise the patterns to effectively capture aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂), hydroxyl (–OH), or thiol (–SH) groups at the α, β, or γ positions. Generalize the patterns to allow for different chain lengths and configurations while maintaining the proximity of functional groups to the carboxyl group.

2. **Refine Functional Group Position Criteria**:
   - For **Rule 3**, adjust the patterns to accurately identify functional groups located beyond the γ position. Specify the minimum number of carbon atoms required between the carboxyl group and the functional group to classify modifiers correctly.
   - Ensure that the rules distinguish between modifiers where functional groups enhance coordination due to their position and those where the position diminishes their effectiveness.

3. **Improve Aromatic Substitution Patterns**:
   - **Rule 4 and Rule 5**: Create generalized SMARTS patterns for para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups. Ensure that the patterns accurately reflect the electronic effects of various substituents and their influence on coordination with the catalyst.
   - Include a range of substituents and consider their steric and electronic properties to improve the predictive power of these rules.

4. **Reintroduce and Refine Previously Effective Rules**:
   - Reassess rules that previously contributed positively to model performance but may have been modified or omitted. For example, **Rule 6** (nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids) and **Rule 9** (polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids) should be revisited and adjusted as needed to enhance accuracy.
   - Ensure that these rules are correctly identifying the structural features that lead to high yield.

5. **Balance Specificity and Generality**:
   - Avoid overfitting by ensuring that rules are not overly specific to individual examples. Generalize conditions where appropriate while maintaining the ability to distinguish between high and low-yield modifiers.
   - Combine similar rules when possible to increase support and avoid fragmentation of the dataset.

6. **Utilize Chemical Knowledge and Domain Expertise**:
   - Incorporate established chemical principles to guide rule development. Understanding the coordination chemistry and electronic effects involved in the reaction can help refine the rules.
   - Collaborate with chemists to validate assumptions about how different functional groups and structural features influence catalytic activity.

7. **Iterative Testing and Validation**:
   - Continuously test the revised rules against the dataset, monitoring performance metrics such as support, confidence, lift, and leverage.
   - Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to identify which rules contribute positively to predictions and which may be leading to misclassifications.
   - Refine rules based on feedback from validation results to incrementally improve model performance.

**Possibility of Further Optimization**

There is a strong possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By generalizing SMARTS patterns, refining criteria for functional group positions, improving aromatic substitution patterns, reintroducing effective rules, and balancing specificity with generality, the model's performance can be enhanced significantly. Utilizing chemical knowledge and iterative testing will ensure that the rules are both chemically sound and statistically effective.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids can coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers without steric hindrance or electronic interference from other functional groups. The simple structure allows for optimal interaction with the catalyst, enhancing its activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups.)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂), hydroxyl (–OH), or thiol (–SH) groups at the alpha (α), beta (β), or gamma (γ) positions lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups near the carboxyl group can chelate the metal centers in the catalyst, forming stable complexes. This chelation enhances the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*

      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups at positions beyond the gamma (γ) position (i.e., delta (δ) position or further) lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups located too far from the carboxyl group are less effective in forming strong chelation with the metal centers. The increased distance reduces the coordination efficiency, diminishing the modifier's ability to enhance the catalyst.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups, such as amino (–NH₂), nitro (–NO₂), or bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups at the para position can enhance metal coordination and electron delocalization. This increases the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's active sites, promoting higher catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating and non-coordinating.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating or non-coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups can reduce the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with the metal centers by increasing electron density, which may hinder effective interaction. Non-coordinating groups do not provide additional sites for metal binding.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity. The direct attachment of the carboxyl group ensures effective positioning for coordination, improving catalytic performance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Carboxyl group attached to benzene ring, not directly to the heteroaromatic ring.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages in their structure lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and may prevent optimal alignment of coordinating groups with the catalyst's active sites. They can also increase steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of coordination and catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with polyether chains or multiple ether linkages.)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that have highly fluorinated aliphatic chains lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorinated chains are strongly electron-withdrawing, which can reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group by withdrawing electron density. Additionally, fluorinated compounds may not interact favorably with the catalyst's surface due to hydrophobic interactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide numerous sites for hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst. This enhances the overall interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, promoting higher catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating functional groups, such as indole nitrogen in tryptophan, lead to **high yield**; those without such groups or with non-coordinating side chains lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Side chains with coordinating functional groups enhance interaction with metal centers in the catalyst, improving catalytic performance. Amino acids lacking such groups do not provide additional coordination sites and are less effective modifiers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative with indole nitrogen.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenylalanine derivative without coordinating heteroatoms.)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Lysine derivative with amide group reducing coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol (–SH) groups at the alpha (α), beta (β), or gamma (γ) positions lead to **high yield**; aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aliphatic acids, thiol groups near the carboxylate can strongly coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, steric hindrance and electronic factors may reduce the effectiveness of thiol groups in coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids or possess multiple carboxyl groups close together lead to **high yield**; those with additional interfering functional groups may lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple carboxyl groups can enhance coordination with metal centers due to increased binding sites. However, functional groups like ketones adjacent to carboxyl groups may interfere with coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(False)* *(Ketone group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form undesired complexes with the catalyst, interfering with metal coordination and reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with aromatic aldehyde carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with substituents that increase steric hindrance near the coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near the coordinating sites can prevent effective interaction with the catalyst's metal centers by hindering access, thus reducing the modifier's ability to enhance the reaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Steric hindrance from methylsulfanyl group.)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky benzoyl group adjacent to coordinating sites.)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (–OH) groups on the aromatic ring but without additional chain extension lead to **low yield**; extended chain analogs may lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or lead to unfavorable electronic effects, reducing coordination efficiency. Extension of the chain can mitigate these effects by distancing the hydroxyl group from the coordination site.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Extended chain reduces interference.)*

**End of Rules**

---

These rules capture the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the reaction yield. By combining multiple sub-structures and considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron density, steric hindrance, and functional group effects, the rules provide a comprehensive framework for predicting whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield in the reaction.

The rules balance simplicity and complexity to cover a broad range of the dataset:

- **Simple Rules with High Coverage**: Rules 1, 2, 3, and 4 cover fundamental structural features affecting yield.
- **Complex Rules with Specific Applications**: Rules 10, 11, and 15 address more intricate combinations of functional groups and their positions.

This set of 15 rules should aid in the selection and design of molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction yield for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Generalize Rule 1's SMARTS Pattern for Simple Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**

  - *Action*: Broaden the SMARTS pattern in **Rule 1** to include a wider range of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups. Ensure the pattern captures various chain lengths and branching patterns.
  
  - *Implementation*:
    - Use a more general SMARTS pattern like `C(=O)[O-][C;!$(C(=O))]` to match any aliphatic carboxylate attached to a carbon chain without other functional groups.
    - Exclude molecules with additional substituents by specifying that the carbon chain only contains carbon and hydrogen atoms (alkyl chains).
  
  - *Expected Outcome*: This will increase the coverage of **Rule 1**, capturing more modifiers that fit the criteria and improving the model's performance.

- **Advice 2**: **Revise Rule 2 to Effectively Capture Functional Groups at α, β, or γ Positions**

  - *Action*: Modify the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 2** to include aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂), hydroxyl (–OH), or thiol (–SH) groups at the α, β, or γ positions. Allow for different chain lengths and configurations while maintaining proximity to the carboxyl group.
  
  - *Implementation*:
    - Create SMARTS patterns that specify the position of functional groups relative to the carboxyl group. For example:
      - Alpha position: `C(=O)[O-][CHX4][*]` where `X` is the functional group.
      - Beta position: `C(=O)[O-][CH2][CHX4][*]`.
      - Gamma position: `C(=O)[O-][CH2][CH2][CHX4][*]`.
    - Use recursive SMARTS or wildcard atoms to generalize chain lengths beyond the functional group.
  
  - *Expected Outcome*: This will ensure that **Rule 2** accurately identifies all relevant modifiers, increasing the rule's support and predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rule 3 to Accurately Identify Functional Groups Beyond γ Position**

  - *Action*: Adjust the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 3** to specify functional groups located at the δ position or further from the carboxyl group, ensuring proper classification.
  
  - *Implementation*:
    - Define patterns where the functional group is four or more carbons away from the carboxyl group. For example:
      - Delta position: `C(=O)[O-][CH2][CH2][CH2][CHX4][*]`.
      - Use repetition operators to represent longer chains: `C(=O)[O-][CH2]{3,}[CHX4][*]`.
    - Clearly distinguish these modifiers from those covered in **Rule 2**.
  
  - *Expected Outcome*: Improved differentiation between modifiers that lead to high versus low yield based on the position of functional groups, enhancing the model's accuracy.

- **Advice 4**: **Improve Aromatic Substitution Patterns in Rules 4 and 5**

  - *Action*: Create generalized SMARTS patterns for para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups, reflecting their influence on yield.
  
  - *Implementation*:
    - For electron-withdrawing groups (**Rule 4**):
      - Use a pattern like `c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)[O-]` with a substituent at the para position `[c][c](X)[c](C(=O)[O-])[c]` where `X` is an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., `[N+](=O)[O-]`, `Br`, `Cl`, `C(=O)H`).
    - For electron-donating groups (**Rule 5**):
      - Similar pattern but with `X` as electron-donating groups (e.g., `CH3`, `OCH3`, `OH`).
    - Incorporate the electronic effect of substituents into the rule's logic.
  
  - *Expected Outcome*: Enhanced ability to predict yields based on electronic effects of substituents on aromatic rings, improving model performance.

- **Advice 5**: **Reassess and Refine Rule 6 for Nitrogen-Containing Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids**

  - *Action*: Ensure **Rule 6** accurately captures modifiers where the carboxyl group is directly attached to nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings.
  
  - *Implementation*:
    - Use SMARTS patterns like `n1ccccc1C(=O)[O-]` for pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.
    - Ensure the nitrogen is positioned to effectively coordinate with the metal center, possibly by specifying the position of nitrogen relative to the carboxyl group.
    - Exclude compounds where the carboxyl group is not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring.
  
  - *Expected Outcome*: Correct classification of modifiers fitting **Rule 6**, enhancing rule accuracy and model reliability.

- **Advice 6**: **Reintroduce and Refine Previously Effective Rules, Such as Rule 9**

  - *Action*: Reevaluate rules like **Rule 9** involving polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids), ensuring their SMARTS patterns are accurate.
  
  - *Implementation*:
    - Create patterns that identify multiple hydroxyl groups along an aliphatic chain, e.g., `C(=O)[O-][C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)CO`.
    - Ensure that molecules with the required number of hydroxyl groups are correctly matched.
  
  - *Expected Outcome*: Increased support and confidence for these rules, contributing positively to the overall model performance.

- **Advice 7**: **Balance Specificity and Generality to Avoid Overfitting**

  - *Action*: Review all rules to ensure they are neither too specific nor too general, avoiding overfitting and underfitting.
  
  - *Implementation*:
    - Combine rules with overlapping features or similar outcomes. For example, merge **Rules 2 and 9** if appropriate.
    - Remove redundant conditions or overly specific criteria that apply to only one or two modifiers.
  
  - *Expected Outcome*: A more robust set of rules with broader applicability and improved predictive power.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Chemical Knowledge and Domain Expertise**

  - *Action*: Use established chemical principles to guide rule development, ensuring that rules make chemical sense.
  
  - *Implementation*:
    - Collaborate with chemists to validate the coordination abilities of functional groups and their positions.
    - Consider factors like pKa values, ligand field strength, and steric hindrance in rule formulation.
  
  - *Expected Outcome*: Chemically sound rules that are more likely to predict yields accurately, enhancing model credibility.

- **Advice 9**: **Continuously Test and Validate Revised Rules**

  - *Action*: After modifying rules, iteratively test them against the dataset and adjust based on performance metrics.
  
  - *Implementation*:
    - Use cross-validation techniques to assess the impact of each rule change.
    - Apply SHAP analysis to identify the contribution of each rule to the predictions.
    - Refine rules that consistently lead to misclassifications.
  
  - *Expected Outcome*: Incremental improvements in model accuracy and reliability, leading to a robust predictive model.

- **Advice 10**: **Ensure Correct Implementation of SMARTS Patterns**

  - *Action*: Double-check all SMARTS patterns for syntactic and logical correctness to prevent misclassifications due to pattern errors.
  
  - *Implementation*:
    - Use tools like SMARTS Viewer or cheminformatics software to visualize and validate patterns.
    - Test patterns individually against known molecules to confirm correct matches.
  
  - *Expected Outcome*: Accurate pattern matching resulting in correct classification of modifiers, thereby improving model performance.

      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups.)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) groups at the alpha (α), beta (β), or gamma (γ) positions lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Amino groups near the carboxylate can chelate metal centers in the catalyst, forming stable complexes that enhance catalytic efficiency. The proximity of the amino group facilitates effective coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*

      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl (–OH) groups at positions beyond the gamma (γ) position (delta (δ) position or further) lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups located too far from the carboxylate group are less effective in chelating metal centers. The increased distance reduces coordination efficiency, diminishing the modifier's ability to enhance the catalyst.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups, such as amino (–NH₂), nitro (–NO₂), or bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups at the para position enhance metal coordination and electron delocalization. This increases interaction with the catalyst's active sites, promoting higher catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)*

      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups, such as methyl (–CH₃) or methoxy (–OCH₃), lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing the carboxyl group's ability to coordinate with metal centers. This hinders effective interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group is electron-donating when directly attached to the ring.)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity. Direct attachment of the carboxyl group ensures effective positioning for coordination, improving catalytic performance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Carboxyl group attached to benzene ring.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and can prevent optimal alignment of coordinating groups with the catalyst's active sites. They may also increase steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with polyether chains in the dataset.)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are strongly electron-withdrawing, reducing the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group by withdrawing electron density. Fluorinated chains may also have unfavorable interactions with the catalyst's surface.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with highly fluorinated chains.)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating functional groups, such as the indole nitrogen in tryptophan, lead to **high yield**; those without coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Side chains with coordinating functional groups enhance interaction with metal centers in the catalyst, improving catalytic performance. Amino acids without such groups lack additional coordination sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenylalanine derivative.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous sites for hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst, enhancing overall interaction and catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Gluconic acid.)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples with polyhydroxylated acids.)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form undesired complexes with the catalyst, interfering with metal coordination and reducing efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with aromatic aldehyde carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol (–SH) groups at the alpha (α), beta (β), or gamma (γ) positions lead to **high yield**; aromatic counterparts lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aliphatic acids, thiol groups near the carboxylate can strongly coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, steric and electronic factors reduce thiol effectiveness in coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near coordinating sites can prevent effective interaction with the catalyst's metal centers by causing steric hindrance, thus reducing the modifier's efficacy.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group.)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids or possess multiple carboxyl groups close together lead to **high yield** unless additional interfering groups are present.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple carboxyl groups enhance coordination with metal centers due to increased binding sites. However, interfering functional groups like ketones adjacent to carboxyl groups may negate this effect.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid.)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(False)* *(Ketone group may interfere.)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (–OH) groups directly attached to the ring without chain extension lead to **low yield**; chain-extended analogs lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or cause unfavorable electronic effects, reducing coordination efficiency. Extension of the chain distances the hydroxyl group from the coordination site, mitigating these effects.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)*

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* provides clear guidance on nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids, supported by good property insight into coordination chemistry. It has acceptable complexity and is backed by multiple examples, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* has clear criteria regarding polyether chains leading to low yield. However, coverage is limited to only two low-yield examples, reducing confidence in its generality. Additional supporting data would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* addresses highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids leading to low yield with clear reasoning. While the rule is clear and has reasonable property insight, it is supported by only two low-yield examples. Expanding data coverage would enhance its robustness.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* has low coverage, with only one high-yield (tryptophan derivative) and one low-yield (phenylalanine derivative) example. While the rule offers interesting property insight, its specificity and limited data support weaken its applicability. Consider integrating it with other rules or obtaining more data.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* is supported by only two high-yield examples and lacks low-yield examples for contrast. The rule is clear and offers reasonable property insight, but limited coverage reduces its reliability. More data points are needed for stronger validation.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* has very low coverage, supported by a single low-yield example (4-formylbenzoic acid). The rule is clear and the property insight is plausible, but insufficient data support hinders its confidence level. Additional examples are necessary.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* is based on one high-yield and one low-yield example, providing minimal coverage. The distinction between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing acids is interesting, but more data are needed to confirm this trend.

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* has limited coverage with only two low-yield examples and no high-yield counterparts. While the rule addresses steric hindrance effects, the lack of data reduces its conclusiveness. Broader data support would improve its validity.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Improve the coverage of Rule 1** by incorporating additional supporting examples or merging it with Rule 2. Since Rule 1 currently has only one supporting data point (**octanoic acid**), consider combining it with Rule 2 to create a more comprehensive rule that includes simple aliphatic carboxylic acids both with and without small functional groups at the α, β, or γ positions that lead to high yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Expand Rule 7** by providing more data points or refining the rule to increase its applicability. The current rule has limited coverage with only two low-yield examples. Consider specifying the chain lengths or types of ether linkages that significantly impact yield, or merge this rule with other rules addressing steric hindrance (e.g., Rule 13).

- **Advice 3**: **Strengthen Rule 8** by gathering additional data or integrating it with other rules involving electron-withdrawing groups. With only two low-yield examples, the rule's coverage is limited. Broaden the rule to include other highly electron-withdrawing substituents that negatively impact yield, not just fluorinated chains.

- **Advice 4**: **Reconsider Rule 9** due to its low coverage. With only one high-yield and one low-yield example, the rule may be too specific. Consider combining it with Rule 2 or Rule 10 to form a more general rule about amino acids with coordinating side chains enhancing yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance Rule 10** by including low-yield examples for better contrast or integrating it with similar rules to improve coverage. Since the rule lacks low-yield examples, merging it with Rule 9 or expanding it to include other polyhydroxylated compounds could increase its utility.

- **Advice 6**: **Supplement Rule 11** with additional examples or merge it with existing rules on interfering groups. The rule currently has only one low-yield example. Consider combining it with rules that address electron-donating groups or aldehyde functionalities on aromatic rings (e.g., Rule 5 or Rule 13).

- **Advice 7**: **Refine Rule 12** by obtaining more supporting data or integrating it with Rule 2. With limited examples, the rule's applicability is constrained. Merging it with Rule 2, which discusses functional groups at specific positions in aliphatic acids, may enhance its coverage.

- **Advice 8**: **Expand Rule 13** by adding more supporting examples to improve coverage. Currently, it has only two low-yield examples. Alternatively, consider integrating it with other rules that address steric hindrance near coordinating groups (e.g., Rule 7 or Rule 14).

- **Advice 9**: **Strengthen Rule 15** by gathering additional data points or combining it with Rules 4 and 5. With limited examples, the rule's reliability is low. Merging it with rules focusing on substituent effects in aromatic carboxylic acids may enhance its comprehensiveness.

- **Advice 10**: **Prioritize rules with strong coverage and practical applicability**, such as Rules 2, 3, 4, and 5, when developing or selecting molecular modifiers. Ensure these rules are clearly defined and well-supported to effectively guide the optimization of reaction yields.

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) groups at the alpha (α) or beta (β) positions, and without bulky side chains, lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Amino groups close to the carboxyl group enhance coordination with metal centers in the catalyst due to chelation effects. The absence of bulky side chains minimizes steric hindrance, allowing optimal interaction with the catalyst's active sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group introduces steric hindrance.)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple aliphatic acids can effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers without electronic or steric interference, enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position lead to **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge, thus enhancing interaction with metal centers. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing.)*
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group can coordinate with metals.)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating.)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group is electron-donating.)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) or thiol (–SH) groups at positions up to the gamma (γ) position lead to **high yield**; when these groups are beyond the gamma position, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups close to the carboxylate can chelate metal centers effectively, enhancing catalytic performance. Beyond the γ position, the distance reduces coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at γ position.)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group at β position.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group beyond γ position.)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups near the carboxyl group lead to **high yield**; those with single distant hydroxyl groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding and chelation, improving catalyst interaction. Distant hydroxyl groups are less effective.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Gluconic acid with multiple adjacent hydroxyls.)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Single hydroxyl group far from carboxylate.)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring lead to **high yield**; if the heterocycle is a substituent on a benzene ring, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to a heteroaromatic ring enhances coordination due to the electron-rich nitrogen, whereas attachment through a benzene ring distances the coordinating sites, reducing effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene ring.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Polyether chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, impeding effective coordination with the catalyst's active sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with polyether chains in the dataset.)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces the electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with highly fluorinated acids.)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms, such as indole nitrogen in tryptophan, lead to **high yield**; those without coordinating heteroatoms lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction. Side chains lacking heteroatoms do not contribute additional coordination sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenylalanine derivative.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents or sterically hindering groups near the carboxylate or coordinating functional groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups hinder the access of the catalyst's active sites to the coordinating groups on the modifier, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky side chain introduces steric hindrance.)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in undesired side reactions or form inactive complexes with the catalyst, interfering with coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted thiol (–SH) groups lead to **low yield**; their aliphatic counterparts with thiol groups near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aromatic systems, the thiol group is less available for coordination due to resonance and possible disulfide formation. In aliphatic acids, thiol groups can effectively coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with amino groups near each carboxyl group and without interfering functional groups lead to **high yield**; those with interfering groups or distant amino groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of amino groups adjacent to carboxylates provides multiple coordination sites, enhancing catalyst interaction, unless other groups interfere.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(False)* *(Ketone group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups like methyl (–CH₃) or methoxy (–OCH₃) lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups reduce the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate by increasing electron density, diminishing interaction with the catalyst's metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** *(False)* *(Despite the extended chain, methoxy groups are electron-donating.)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amide (–CONH₂) groups near the carboxylate lead to **low yield** due to potential competition for coordination.**

  - **Explanation**: Amide groups can form hydrogen bonds or coordinate with metal centers, potentially competing with carboxylate coordination and reducing overall effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)*

These rules illustrate how combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties—such as coordination ability, electron-donating or -withdrawing effects, steric factors, and functional group interactions—the rules provide a framework for predicting whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**: Address aliphatic carboxylic acids with or without amino groups.
  - **Rule 3** and **Rule 4**: Focus on substituent effects in aromatic carboxylic acids.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 6**: Consider the position and nature of functional groups in aliphatic and heteroaromatic acids.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 9** and **Rule 10**: Highlight the impact of bulky groups and specific amino acid side chains.
  - **Rule 12** and **Rule 13**: Differentiate effects based on the type and position of thiol groups and dicarboxylic acids.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the performance of various molecular modifiers and strategically design new modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) groups at the alpha (α) or beta (β) positions, and without bulky side chains, lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Amino groups close to the carboxyl group enhance coordination with metal centers in the catalyst due to chelation effects. The absence of bulky side chains minimizes steric hindrance, allowing optimal interaction with the catalyst's active sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group introduces steric hindrance.)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple aliphatic acids can effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers without electronic or steric interference, enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position lead to **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge, thus enhancing interaction with metal centers. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing.)*
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group can coordinate with metals.)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating.)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group is electron-donating.)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) or thiol (–SH) groups at positions up to the gamma (γ) position lead to **high yield**; when these groups are beyond the gamma position, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups close to the carboxylate can chelate metal centers effectively, enhancing catalytic performance. Beyond the γ position, the distance reduces coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at γ position.)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group at β position.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group beyond γ position.)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups near the carboxyl group lead to **high yield**; those with single distant hydroxyl groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding and chelation, improving catalyst interaction. Distant hydroxyl groups are less effective.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Gluconic acid with multiple adjacent hydroxyls.)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Single hydroxyl group far from carboxylate.)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring lead to **high yield**; if the heterocycle is a substituent on a benzene ring, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to a heteroaromatic ring enhances coordination due to the electron-rich nitrogen, whereas attachment through a benzene ring distances the coordinating sites, reducing effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene ring.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Polyether chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, impeding effective coordination with the catalyst's active sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with polyether chains in the dataset.)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces the electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with highly fluorinated acids.)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms, such as indole nitrogen in tryptophan, lead to **high yield**; those without coordinating heteroatoms lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction. Side chains lacking heteroatoms do not contribute additional coordination sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenylalanine derivative.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents or sterically hindering groups near the carboxylate or coordinating functional groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups hinder the access of the catalyst's active sites to the coordinating groups on the modifier, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky side chain introduces steric hindrance.)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in undesired side reactions or form inactive complexes with the catalyst, interfering with coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted thiol (–SH) groups lead to **low yield**; their aliphatic counterparts with thiol groups near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aromatic systems, the thiol group is less available for coordination due to resonance and possible disulfide formation. In aliphatic acids, thiol groups can effectively coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with amino groups near each carboxyl group and without interfering functional groups lead to **high yield**; those with interfering groups or distant amino groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of amino groups adjacent to carboxylates provides multiple coordination sites, enhancing catalyst interaction, unless other groups interfere.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(False)* *(Ketone group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups like methyl (–CH₃) or methoxy (–OCH₃) lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups reduce the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate by increasing electron density, diminishing interaction with the catalyst's metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** *(False)* *(Despite the extended chain, methoxy groups are electron-donating.)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amide (–CONH₂) groups near the carboxylate lead to **low yield** due to potential competition for coordination.**

  - **Explanation**: Amide groups can form hydrogen bonds or coordinate with metal centers, potentially competing with carboxylate coordination and reducing overall effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)*

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate how combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties—such as coordination ability, electron-donating or -withdrawing effects, steric factors, and functional group interactions—the rules provide a framework for predicting whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**: Address aliphatic carboxylic acids with or without amino groups.
  - **Rule 3** and **Rule 4**: Focus on substituent effects in aromatic carboxylic acids.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 6**: Consider the position and nature of functional groups in aliphatic and heteroaromatic acids.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 9** and **Rule 10**: Highlight the impact of bulky groups and specific amino acid side chains.
  - **Rule 12** and **Rule 13**: Differentiate effects based on the type and position of thiol groups and dicarboxylic acids.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the performance of various molecular modifiers and strategically design new modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **For Rule 1**, the SMARTS patterns do not fully capture amino groups at both alpha and beta positions for various chain lengths and dicarboxylic acids. The current patterns `['[NX3H2][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]', '[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]']` may miss molecules where amino groups are on both alpha and beta carbons or in dicarboxylic acids. **Improvement**: Modify the patterns to include variable chain lengths and accommodate dicarboxylic acids. Use recursive SMARTS or add patterns like `'[NX3H2][CX4](\[CX4]){0,1}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to match amino acids with the amino group at alpha or beta positions, including dicarboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 2**: **For Rule 2**, the exclude patterns are overly restrictive, potentially excluding straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with permissible functional groups (e.g., unsaturated bonds). The pattern `carboxylic_acid` alone may match any carboxylic acid, but the exclude patterns `['[!#6;!#1]']`, `[aromatic_atom]`, and `['[NX3]', '[OX2]', '[SX2]', '[PX3]']` may exclude valid modifiers. **Improvement**: Adjust the exclude patterns to allow straight-chain aliphatic acids without additional functional groups interfering with coordination. Remove the `['[!#6;!#1]']` exclude pattern and refine others to allow simple aliphatic chains.

- **Suggestion 3**: **For Rule 3**, the pattern `'c1ccc([F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-])cc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` is too specific and may not match all electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. It might miss groups like nitro, cyano, or carbonyls. **Improvement**: Generalize the EWG pattern to include various electron-withdrawing groups. Use a more inclusive pattern like `'c1ccc([NX3+](=O)[O-], [CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1], [CX3]#N, [SX4](=O)(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])cc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 4**: **For Rule 4**, the patterns may not cover all instances where amino or thiol groups are within up to the gamma position from the carboxylate. The patterns `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4]?[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` and `'[SX2H][CX4][CX4]?[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` could miss modifiers with the functional group at the gamma position in longer chains. **Improvement**: Utilize repetition in SMARTS to specify up to gamma positions: `'[NX3H2]([CX4]){1,3}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` and `'[SX2H]([CX4]){1,3}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 5**: **For Rule 5**, the pattern for multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group lacks specificity and may not enforce the requirement of multiple adjacent hydroxyls. The `'[OX2H][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` pattern checks for a single hydroxyl group next to the carboxyl. **Improvement**: Adjust the pattern to match multiple adjacent hydroxyls, such as `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4][#6]'`, and include a count threshold for hydroxyl groups in proximity.

- **Suggestion 6**: **For Rule 6**, the SMARTS patterns for nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids are too narrow. Patterns like `'[n][c][c][c][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` may only match pyridine derivatives. **Improvement**: Expand patterns to include various nitrogen heterocycles such as pyridine, pyrazine, pyrimidine, and others directly attached to the carboxyl group. Use a general pattern like `'[n;a][a][a][a][a][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 7**: **For Rule 9**, the pattern for amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (`tryptophan_pattern`) is overly simplified and may not differentiate between tryptophan and phenylalanine derivatives. **Improvement**: Create specific patterns for side chains with heteroatoms, such as `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX3](=[CX3H])[c]1c[nH]c2c1cccc2'` for tryptophan.

- **Suggestion 8**: **For Rule 10**, the code checks only for the presence of the carboxylic acid group and excludes molecules with bulky side chains using `[bulky_side_chain]`. However, the definition of bulky groups is limited. **Improvement**: Broaden the exclude patterns to detect various bulky substituents near the carboxylate. Use SMARTS patterns that identify tert-butyl groups or other large substituents close to functional groups, such as `'[CX4]([CX4])([CX4])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 9**: **For Rule 13**, the patterns may not effectively detect aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with amino groups near each carboxyl group. The patterns `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` and `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX2][CX4][NX3H2]'` might miss some valid structures. **Improvement**: Use patterns that match amino groups adjacent to both carboxyl groups in a dicarboxylic acid, such as `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1].[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX2][CX4][NX3H2]'`.

- **Suggestion 10**: **In General**, several rules use specific patterns that may not cover all possible cases described in the natural language rules. **Improvement**: Consider using recursive SMARTS and including more variations in patterns to capture the full scope of each rule. Test patterns against a wider range of example molecules to validate their effectiveness.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Feature Matrix Evaluation**: The feature matrix shows many zeros where matches are expected, indicating that the code may not be correctly identifying molecules that fit the rules. **Improvement**: After refining the SMARTS patterns, re-run the code and validate the feature matrix against known examples from the rules. Ensure that high-yield modifiers produce a `1` and low-yield modifiers produce a `-1` in the corresponding rule columns.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Code Structure**: In the processing loop, the code may not properly handle counts or pattern matches within groups, especially when multiple patterns are provided for a rule. **Improvement**: Adjust the code to ensure that if any pattern within a group's sub-patterns matches, the group is considered a match. Also, correctly implement count thresholds for functional groups as per the rules.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Error Handling**: The code appends zeros for molecules that cannot be parsed but does not report parsing issues. **Improvement**: Include logging or warnings for molecules that fail to parse to aid in debugging.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Testing and Validation**: Create a validation set using the supporting examples provided in each rule to test the code thoroughly. **Improvement**: Use the positive and negative examples to check if the code classifies them correctly and adjust the SMARTS patterns accordingly.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) groups at the alpha (α) or beta (β) positions, and without bulky side chains, lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Amino groups close to the carboxyl group enhance coordination with metal centers in the catalyst due to chelation effects. The absence of bulky side chains minimizes steric hindrance, allowing optimal interaction with the catalyst's active sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group introduces steric hindrance.)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple aliphatic acids can effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers without electronic or steric interference, enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position lead to **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge, thus enhancing interaction with metal centers. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing.)*
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group can coordinate with metals.)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating.)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group is electron-donating.)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) or thiol (–SH) groups at positions up to the gamma (γ) position lead to **high yield**; when these groups are beyond the gamma position, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups close to the carboxylate can chelate metal centers effectively, enhancing catalytic performance. Beyond the γ position, the distance reduces coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at γ position.)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group at β position.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group beyond γ position.)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups near the carboxyl group lead to **high yield**; those with single distant hydroxyl groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding and chelation, improving catalyst interaction. Distant hydroxyl groups are less effective.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Gluconic acid with multiple adjacent hydroxyls.)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Single hydroxyl group far from carboxylate.)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring lead to **high yield**; if the heterocycle is a substituent on a benzene ring, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to a heteroaromatic ring enhances coordination due to the electron-rich nitrogen, whereas attachment through a benzene ring distances the coordinating sites, reducing effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene ring.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Polyether chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, impeding effective coordination with the catalyst's active sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with polyether chains in the dataset.)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces the electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with highly fluorinated acids.)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms, such as indole nitrogen in tryptophan, lead to **high yield**; those without coordinating heteroatoms lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction. Side chains lacking heteroatoms do not contribute additional coordination sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenylalanine derivative.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents or sterically hindering groups near the carboxylate or coordinating functional groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups hinder the access of the catalyst's active sites to the coordinating groups on the modifier, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky side chain introduces steric hindrance.)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in undesired side reactions or form inactive complexes with the catalyst, interfering with coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted thiol (–SH) groups lead to **low yield**; their aliphatic counterparts with thiol groups near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aromatic systems, the thiol group is less available for coordination due to resonance and possible disulfide formation. In aliphatic acids, thiol groups can effectively coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with amino groups near each carboxyl group and without interfering functional groups lead to **high yield**; those with interfering groups or distant amino groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of amino groups adjacent to carboxylates provides multiple coordination sites, enhancing catalyst interaction, unless other groups interfere.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(False)* *(Ketone group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups like methyl (–CH₃) or methoxy (–OCH₃) lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups reduce the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate by increasing electron density, diminishing interaction with the catalyst's metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** *(False)* *(Despite the extended chain, methoxy groups are electron-donating.)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amide (–CONH₂) groups near the carboxylate lead to **low yield** due to potential competition for coordination.**

  - **Explanation**: Amide groups can form hydrogen bonds or coordinate with metal centers, potentially competing with carboxylate coordination and reducing overall effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)*

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns to ensure correct adjacency and connectivity of functional groups.** For example, in **Rule 1**, the pattern for the alpha amino group `[NX3H2][CHX][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` may not correctly enforce that the amino group is directly attached to the carbon adjacent to the carboxylate group. Adjust the pattern to `[NX3H2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` for alpha amino acids and `[NX3H2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` for beta amino acids to accurately represent the structure.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Modify the patterns to match entire molecular fragments rather than isolated functional groups.** For instance, in **Rule 2**, the pattern for straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids `[CH3][CH2]{4,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` may exclude shorter chains like octanoic acid. Adjust the pattern to `[CH3][CH2]{2,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` to include chains with two or more methylene groups, and ensure that there are no other functional groups by adding `[!$(...)]` patterns to exclude amines, alcohols, and other substituents.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Use recursive SMARTS or atom mapping to ensure substituents are correctly positioned relative to functional groups.** In **Rule 3**, the pattern for electron-withdrawing groups at the para position may be too specific. Generalize the pattern to `c1ccc([$(N(=O)=O),$(F),$(Cl),$(Br),$(I),$(C#N),$(S(=O)(=O)O[H])]c1)C(=O)O` to match any electron-withdrawing group at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Ensure exclude patterns are correctly implemented and comprehensive.** In some rules, the exclude patterns may not cover all possible interfering groups. For example, in **Rule 2**, add exclude patterns for all functional groups that should not be present, such as `[OX2H]`, `[NX3]`, `[SX2H]`, and patterns for rings like `[$(R)]`.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Implement checks for the relative positions of functional groups within the molecule.** For **Rule 4**, it's important that the amino or thiol groups are within the alpha to gamma positions relative to the carboxyl group. Modify the patterns to capture this relationship accurately, such as using `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][CH2][NX3H2]` for gamma amino groups.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Use more general patterns to capture a wider range of functional groups that fit the rule descriptions.** For **Rule 5**, the pattern for multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CHX][OX2H]` may be too restrictive. Consider using a pattern like `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][OX2H]` or `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][CH2][OX2H]` to include more molecules with hydroxyl groups within two carbons of the carboxylate.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Incorporate stereochemistry and charge states where relevant.** For amino acids and zwitterions, ensure that patterns account for the protonation state of the amino group and the carboxylate. Use SMARTS that allow for both protonated and deprotonated forms.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Add error handling and logging to the code to identify mismatches and debugging purposes.** This will help in tracing which molecules are not matching and why, allowing for adjustments to patterns or code logic.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Review the SMARTS syntax and ensure that special characters and operators are used correctly.** Misplaced or incorrect use of operators like `!`, `$`, and `;` can lead to patterns not matching as intended. Double-check the syntax for each pattern.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Test the patterns individually on known molecules to validate their correctness before integrating them into the code.** Use RDKit or another cheminformatics toolkit to test each SMARTS pattern against molecules that are known to either match or not match, based on the rule definitions.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the Rules by Grouping Similar Functional Groups and Structural Features**

  - **Explanation**: Many current rules overlap or are variations of a theme (e.g., effects of electron-withdrawing/donating groups, presence of coordinating heteroatoms). By consolidating these into broader rules with defined categories, you reduce complexity and make it easier to apply them computationally.
  
  - **Implementation**: Create generalized rules for:
    - Presence of electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) vs. electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) on aromatic rings.
    - Aliphatic acids with coordinating groups (e.g., amino, thiol) within a specific distance from the carboxyl group.
    - Steric hindrance effects based on molecular size or the presence of bulky substituents.

- **Advice 2**: **Quantify Structural Features Using Molecular Descriptors**

  - **Explanation**: Replace qualitative terms like "near," "bulky," or "multiple" with quantifiable parameters that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. This approach facilitates the generation of a numeric feature matrix for modeling.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Define numerical distances (e.g., the number of atoms between functional groups).
    - Calculate steric parameters such as van der Waals volume or molar refractivity.
    - Use counts of specific functional groups (e.g., number of –OH, –NH₂ groups).

- **Advice 3**: **Adopt Standardized Molecular Descriptors and Physicochemical Properties**

  - **Explanation**: Utilize widely accepted descriptors (e.g., LogP, topological polar surface area, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors) that are easily computed and interpreted.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Compute and include descriptors like molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), TPSA (topological polar surface area), H-bond donors (HBD), and H-bond acceptors (HBA).
    - Integrate electronic descriptors such as Hammett sigma constants for substituents.

- **Advice 4**: **Rephrase Rules to Focus on Measurable Properties Derived from SMILES**

  - **Explanation**: Ensure that rules are based on features that can be directly extracted from the SMILES notation without ambiguity.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Specify rules like "Modifiers with a total of X hydrogen bond donors" or "Modifiers where the carboxyl group is conjugated with an aromatic system possessing Y electron-withdrawing substituents."
    - Avoid subjective terms; instead, use structural features identifiable in SMILES strings.

- **Advice 5**: **Eliminate Redundancies and Merge Overlapping Rules**

  - **Explanation**: Combine rules that have overlapping criteria to create a more efficient and streamlined set of rules.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Review the current rules to identify redundancies (e.g., Rules 1, 4, and 13 all deal with amino acids and coordination).
    - Merge these into a single rule with clear parameters.

- **Advice 6**: **Introduce Numerical Thresholds for Descriptor Values**

  - **Explanation**: Define specific numerical thresholds or ranges for descriptors that correlate with high or low yield, making it easier to classify modifiers computationally.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - For example, "Modifiers with LogP between X and Y lead to high yield."
    - "Modifiers with a distance of ≤3 atoms between the carboxyl group and the amino group result in high yield."

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Machine-Learning-Friendly Features**

  - **Explanation**: Structure the rules to produce features suitable for machine learning algorithms, enhancing the ability to predict yields.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Encode categorical variables (e.g., presence of specific functional groups) as binary features.
    - Use one-hot encoding for different types of substituents or ring systems.

- **Advice 8**: **Utilize Cheminformatics Tools to Automate Feature Extraction**

  - **Explanation**: Employ software that can parse SMILES strings and calculate the necessary descriptors automatically, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use tools like RDKit, ChemAxon, or Open Babel to compute descriptors.
    - Develop scripts to process SMILES data and output the feature matrix directly.

- **Advice 9**: **Consider the Electronic and Steric Effects Holistically**

  - **Explanation**: Some rules focus solely on electronic effects while others on steric hindrance; combining these aspects can provide a more accurate depiction of the modifiers' behavior.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Create composite descriptors that account for both electronic (e.g., Hammett constants) and steric parameters (e.g., Taft steric factors).
    - Use 3D molecular modeling to assess spatial arrangement when necessary.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Rules Using Statistical Analysis**

  - **Explanation**: After revising the rules, statistically validate them against the dataset to ensure they have predictive power and adjust as needed.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Perform regression or classification analysis to test the correlation between the descriptors and the reaction yield.
    - Refine thresholds and parameters based on statistical significance.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) groups at the alpha (α) or beta (β) positions lead to **high yield**; when the amino group is further away or there are bulky groups, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Amino groups near the carboxylate can chelate metal centers effectively, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant amino groups or bulky substituents reduce coordination efficiency due to decreased chelation and increased steric hindrance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at γ position but still close enough for coordination.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group is distant, and acetamido group adds steric bulk.)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate.)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para or meta positions lead to **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents or interfering groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate by stabilizing the negative charge, enhancing interaction with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination, while interfering groups may block coordination sites or engage in side reactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing.)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl is electron-withdrawing.)*
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group can act as an additional coordination site.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating.)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group is electron-donating.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring lead to **high yield**; if the heterocycle is a substituent on a benzene ring or there is steric hindrance, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment allows lone pairs on heteroatoms to participate in coordination, enhancing catalyst interaction. Attachment via a benzene ring increases distance and steric hindrance, reducing effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate attached directly to pyridine ring.)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate attached to pyrazole ring.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene ring, increasing steric hindrance.)*
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(True)* *(Exception due to flexible aliphatic chain reducing steric effects.)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**; if these groups are distant or if interfering groups are present, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups close to the carboxylate can chelate metal centers, enhancing coordination and stability. Distant groups are less effective, and interfering groups may block coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol at β position enhances coordination.)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls near carboxylate enable chelation.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate.)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains connecting coordinating groups to the carboxylic acid lead to **high yield**; those with rigid structures or bulky substituents near the coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Flexibility allows the modifier to adapt for optimal interaction with the catalyst. Rigid or bulky structures hinder access to coordination sites due to steric effects.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain and phenolic hydroxyl aid coordination.)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Long, flexible aliphatic chain.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Rigid aromatic side chain near amino group.)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*

---

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with polyether chains in the dataset.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids lead to **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindering groups near the carboxylate or coordinating functional groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes the effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky side chains hinder coordination.)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**; those with single distant hydroxyl groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups can form strong coordination complexes with metal centers through chelation. Single hydroxyl groups far from the carboxylate are less effective in coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Gluconic acid with adjacent hydroxyls.)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted thiol (–SH), aldehyde (–CHO), or other potentially interfering groups lead to **low yield**; their aliphatic counterparts with these groups near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aromatic systems, these groups may participate in side reactions or resonance structures that reduce coordination effectiveness. In aliphatic acids, these groups can coordinate effectively when near the carboxylate.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol on aromatic ring less effective.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde may engage in side reactions.)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol near carboxylate enhances coordination in aliphatic chain.)*

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and provides sufficient detail to determine yield based on the position of amino groups in aliphatic carboxylic acids. The property insight is solid, explaining how proximity facilitates chelation. It considers combinations of sub-structures (carboxylic acid and amino group position). The rule is well-supported by multiple data points for both high and low yields, indicating good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and allows for straightforward prediction based on substituent type and position on aromatic carboxylic acids. The property insight is appropriate, explaining the effects of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on coordination ability. The rule accounts for combinations of structural features and is supported by several examples for both high and low yields, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides a reasonable guideline regarding nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids. However, the clarity is somewhat reduced due to exceptions like 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, which complicate the rule. The property insight is acceptable, explaining coordination via heteroatoms. The rule includes combinations of structural features but has limited coverage with fewer examples, including conflicting data points, which affects its reliability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and allows for accurate prediction based on the proximity of coordinating groups in aliphatic carboxylic acids. The property insight is solid, highlighting the importance of chelation. It involves combinations of sub-structures and is supported by several data points for both high and low yields, demonstrating satisfactory coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and provides understandable criteria based on chain flexibility and steric hindrance. The property insight is valid, explaining how flexibility aids coordination. It considers combinations of structural features and is supported by relevant examples for both high and low yields, demonstrating adequate coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and specific regarding modifiers with polyether chains. The property insight is reasonable, suggesting that ether linkages can hinder coordination. However, the rule focuses on a single functional group without considering combinations, reducing complexity. The coverage is limited, with only low yield examples and no high-yield counterparts, which limits the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and explains the impact of fluorination on coordination ability. The property insight is acceptable. However, the rule is quite specific and does not involve combinations of sub-structures, reducing complexity. The coverage is limited to a couple of examples with low yield, which restricts its overall applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and effectively highlights the impact of steric hindrance near coordinating sites. The property insight is good. It considers combinations of structural features and is supported by multiple examples of low yield, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and provides specific criteria based on the number and position of hydroxyl groups. The property insight is solid, explaining the role of multiple hydroxyl groups in coordination. It considers combinations of functional groups and is supported by examples for both high and low yields, indicating good coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 addresses the differing effects of functional groups in aromatic versus aliphatic contexts. While the rule provides property insights, the clarity is somewhat reduced due to the complexity of comparing aromatic and aliphatic counterparts. It considers combinations of structural features but has limited coverage with few examples, which may affect its reliability.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules to Enhance Clarity and Coverage**

  Identify and merge rules that address similar structural features or effects to create more generalized rules with broader coverage. For example, **Rule 8** (steric hindrance from bulky groups) and **Rule 10** (bulky substituents in aromatic vs. aliphatic acids) both deal with steric effects hindering coordination. Combining them into a single rule about steric hindrance near coordinating sites will simplify the ruleset and improve applicability.

- **Advice 2**: **Expand Data Coverage for Rules with Limited Supporting Examples**

  For rules with low coverage, such as **Rule 2** (simple aliphatic carboxylic acids leading to high yield) and **Rule 7** (polyether chains leading to low yield), gather additional data to strengthen their validity. Incorporate more examples of modifiers that fit these criteria to provide a solid foundation for the rules and increase confidence in their predictive power.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rules to Account for Exceptions and Conflicting Data**

  Address exceptions and conflicting data points within the rules by refining their criteria. For instance, in **Rule 3**, the exception of **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** leading to high yield despite being a heterocycle attached via a benzene ring suggests that chain flexibility can mitigate steric hindrance. Modify the rule to include such nuances, enhancing its accuracy and reliability.

- **Advice 4**: **Clarify Functional Group Effects and Positions**

  Ensure that all rules clearly specify the effects of different functional groups and their positions relative to the carboxylate. For example, emphasize in **Rule 4** and **Rule 5** how the proximity of amino, thiol, or hydroxyl groups enhances coordination, while distant groups reduce yield. This clarity will help users more easily apply the rules to predict outcomes.

- **Advice 5**: **Simplify Complex Rules by Focusing on Key Factors**

  Break down overly complex rules into simpler components that highlight the most impactful factors. For example, **Rule 9** and **Rule 12** can be simplified by focusing on the presence or absence of coordinating heteroatoms in side chains, rather than detailing specific amino acids. This approach makes the rules more accessible and easier to apply.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Steric and Electronic Effects Consistently Across Rules**

  Review all rules to ensure that steric and electronic effects are consistently considered. For example, update **Rule 14** to explicitly mention how electron-donating groups reduce coordination ability due to increased electron density, aligning it with the explanations provided in other rules. Consistency enhances the overall coherence of the ruleset.

- **Advice 7**: **Provide Additional Supporting Examples Where Lacking**

  Add more supporting examples to rules that currently have limited examples, especially high-yield modifiers for rules predominantly supported by low-yield examples (e.g., **Rule 7** and **Rule 8**). This balance strengthens the rules and provides clearer guidance for predicting both high and low yields.

- **Advice 8**: **Highlight the Role of Chain Flexibility in Modifiers**

  Update rules to emphasize how chain flexibility can influence yield by affecting steric hindrance and coordination. For instance, revise **Rule 3** to include that flexible aliphatic chains attached to heterocycles can mitigate steric effects, as seen with **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** leading to high yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Consider Combining Rules Based on Functional Group Similarities**

  Look for opportunities to combine rules that deal with similar functional groups influencing yield in comparable ways. For example, merge **Rule 5** (hydroxyl groups) and **Rule 4** (amino and thiol groups) into a broader rule about modifiers with coordinating functional groups near the carboxylate leading to high yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Ensure Rules Are Supported by Strong Property Insights**

  Re-evaluate rules to confirm they are grounded in solid chemical principles, and enhance explanations where necessary. This strengthens the rationale behind each rule, making them more persuasive and scientifically robust.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) groups at the alpha (α) or beta (β) positions lead to **high yield**; when the amino group is further away or there are bulky groups, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Amino groups near the carboxylate can chelate metal centers effectively, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant amino groups or bulky substituents reduce coordination efficiency due to decreased chelation and increased steric hindrance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at γ position but still close enough for coordination.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group is distant, and acetamido group adds steric bulk.)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate.)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para or meta positions lead to **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents or interfering groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate by stabilizing the negative charge, enhancing interaction with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination, while interfering groups may block coordination sites or engage in side reactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing.)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl is electron-withdrawing.)*
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group can act as an additional coordination site.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating.)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group is electron-donating.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring lead to **high yield**; if the heterocycle is a substituent on a benzene ring or there is steric hindrance, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment allows lone pairs on heteroatoms to participate in coordination, enhancing catalyst interaction. Attachment via a benzene ring increases distance and steric hindrance, reducing effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate attached directly to pyridine ring.)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate attached to pyrazole ring.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene ring, increasing steric hindrance.)*
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(True)* *(Exception due to flexible aliphatic chain reducing steric effects.)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**; if these groups are distant or if interfering groups are present, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups close to the carboxylate can chelate metal centers, enhancing coordination and stability. Distant groups are less effective, and interfering groups may block coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol at β position enhances coordination.)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls near carboxylate enable chelation.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate.)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains connecting coordinating groups to the carboxylic acid lead to **high yield**; those with rigid structures or bulky substituents near the coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Flexibility allows the modifier to adapt for optimal interaction with the catalyst. Rigid or bulky structures hinder access to coordination sites due to steric effects.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain and phenolic hydroxyl aid coordination.)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Long, flexible aliphatic chain.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Rigid aromatic side chain near amino group.)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and may adopt conformations that hinder effective coordination with the catalyst's active sites. They can also solvate metal ions, reducing availability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with polyether chains in the dataset.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids lead to **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindering groups near the carboxylate or coordinating functional groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes the effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky side chains hinder coordination.)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**; those with single distant hydroxyl groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups can form strong coordination complexes with metal centers through chelation. Single hydroxyl groups far from the carboxylate are less effective in coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Gluconic acid with adjacent hydroxyls.)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted thiol (–SH), aldehyde (–CHO), or other potentially interfering groups lead to **low yield**; their aliphatic counterparts with these groups near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aromatic systems, these groups may participate in side reactions or resonance structures that reduce coordination effectiveness. In aliphatic acids, these groups can coordinate effectively when near the carboxylate.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol on aromatic ring less effective.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde may engage in side reactions.)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol near carboxylate enhances coordination in aliphatic chain.)*

These rules illustrate how combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties—such as coordination ability, electron-donating or -withdrawing effects, steric factors, and functional group proximity—the rules provide a framework for predicting whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**: Address aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids with emphasis on the position and nature of substituents.
  - **Rule 4** and **Rule 5**: Focus on the proximity of coordinating groups and the flexibility of the modifiers.
  - **Rule 8**: Highlights the general impact of steric hindrance.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 3** and **Rule 7**: Discuss specific ring structures and the effects of fluorination.
  - **Rule 6** and **Rule 9**: Consider the impact of polyether chains and multiple hydroxyl groups.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the performance of various molecular modifiers and strategically design new modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Improve the SMARTS patterns for Rule 1 to correctly identify alpha and beta amino carboxylic acids.**

  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS patterns for `alpha_amino_carboxylic_acid` and `beta_amino_carboxylic_acid` do not match molecules where the amino group and carboxylic acid are connected through a carbon chain, such as in standard amino acids.

  - **Recommendation**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to allow for variable connectivity and ensure that the amino group is at the alpha or beta position relative to the carboxylic acid. Use recursive SMARTS or adjust the pattern to capture common amino acid structures.

    - **Revised Patterns**:
      - **Alpha amino acid**: `[NX3;H2][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`
      - **Beta amino acid**: `[NX3;H2][CX4H2][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`

    - **Implementation**:
      ```python
      alpha_amino_carboxylic_acid = '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
      beta_amino_carboxylic_acid = '[NX3;H2][CX4H2][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
      ```
    - **Note**: Adjust `[CX4H]([*])` to match carbons with at least one hydrogen to avoid matching quaternary carbons.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Revise the exclude patterns for bulky groups in Rule 1 to accurately reflect steric hindrance.**

  - **Issue**: The current `bulky_group` pattern `[CX4]([CX4])([CX4])[CX4]` only captures specific tertiary carbons and misses other forms of steric bulk near the functional groups.

  - **Recommendation**: Expand the definition of bulky groups to include any carbon adjacent to the amino or carboxyl group that is substituted with large groups, such as phenyl rings or branched alkyl chains.

    - **Revised Bulky Group Pattern**:
      - `[CX4;R0][CX4;R0]([CX3,R0])([CX3,R0])[CX3,R0]`  *(A carbon connected to three other carbons, none of which are in a ring)*
  
    - **Implementation**:
      ```python
      bulky_group = '[CX4;!R][CX4;!R]([CX4;!R])([CX4;!R])[CX4;!R]'
      ```

- **Suggestion 3**: **Enhance the SMARTS patterns for Rule 2 to accurately differentiate between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids.**

  - **Issue**: The patterns for electron-withdrawing (`ewg_para`, `ewg_meta`) and electron-donating groups (`edg_para`, `edg_meta`) are too specific and may not capture all relevant substituents.

  - **Recommendation**: Use more general patterns to match a broader range of EWGs and EDGs at the para or meta positions.

    - **Revised Patterns**:
      - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: `[c][c](=[O,N])[c]`, `[c][c](F,Cl,Br,I)[c]`
      - **Electron-Donating Groups**: `[c][c]([OH,NH2,OR])[c]`

    - **Implementation**:
      ```python
      ewg_para = 'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2])cc1 |$;;;;;;;;_AP1$|'
      edg_para = 'c1ccc([OX2H,OX1-])cc1 |$;;;;;;;;_AP1$|'
      ```
    - **Note**: Use the `|$...$|` notation or atom mapping to specify positions if necessary.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Adjust the patterns in Rule 3 to ensure that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids are correctly identified.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern for `hetero_aromatic_carboxylic_acid` may not match all relevant heterocycles with directly attached carboxyl groups.

  - **Recommendation**: Use a more general pattern to capture various nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings with carboxylic acid substituents.

    - **Revised Pattern**:
      - `[nX2][cH1]1[cH1][cH1][cH1][cH1]1C(=O)[OX2H1]` *(For pyridine derivatives)*
      - Generalize to `[n][c][c][c][c][c](C(=O)[O])` for any position.

    - **Implementation**:
      ```python
      hetero_aromatic_carboxylic_acid = '[n][AR0][c][c][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
      ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **In Rule 4, expand the patterns for functional groups capable of metal coordination near the carboxylate.**

  - **Issue**: The current patterns only include hydroxyl and thiol groups but exclude other coordinating groups like amino (-NH2) and phosphonate groups.

  - **Recommendation**: Include additional functional groups such as amino groups for coordination.

    - **Revised Patterns**:
      - Hydroxyl near carboxylic acid: `[OX2H][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`
      - Thiol near carboxylic acid: `[SX2H][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`
      - **New** Amino near carboxylic acid: `[NX3;H2][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`

    - **Implementation**:
      ```python
      amino_near_carboxylic_acid = '[NX3;H2][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
      ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **Refine Rule 5 to better distinguish flexible aliphatic chains from rigid structures.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern `carboxylic_acid` is too general and matches any carboxylic acid, including those with rigid structures or bulky substituents.

  - **Recommendation**: Modify the pattern to specifically look for aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of a certain length and without branching near the functional groups.

    - **Revised Pattern**:
      - Flexible aliphatic chain: `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][CX4][CX4]`

    - **Implementation**:
      ```python
      flexible_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][CX4][CX4]'
      ```

    - **Exclude Patterns**: Include branching or ring structures as exclude patterns to filter out rigid or bulky structures.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Update the pattern for polyether chains in Rule 6 to ensure accurate detection.**

  - **Issue**: The current `polyether_chain` pattern may miss molecules with fewer ether linkages or those with ether linkages interrupted by other atoms.

  - **Recommendation**: Use a repeating pattern for ethers and allow for variations in chain length.

    - **Revised Pattern**:
      - Polyether chain: `([#6][OX2]){2,}[#6]`

    - **Implementation**:
      ```python
      polyether_chain = '([#6][OX2]){'+'2'+',}[#6]'
      ```

    - **Note**: Adjust the quantifier `{2,}` to match two or more repeating units.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Correct the definition of highly fluorinated chains in Rule 7 to match perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids.**

  - **Issue**: The current `fluorinated_chain` pattern may not match all perfluorinated chains due to specific atom connectivity requirements.

  - **Recommendation**: Use a more general pattern that matches any aliphatic chain where most or all hydrogens are replaced with fluorines.

    - **Revised Pattern**:
      - `[CX4]([CX4](F)(F)F)([CX4](F)(F)F)[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`

    - **Implementation**:
      ```python
      fluorinated_chain = '[CX4]([CX4](F)(F)F)([CX4](F)(F)F)[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
      ```

    - **Alternatively**, use a recursive SMARTS to match multiple fluorines:
      ```python
      fluorinated_chain = '[CX4;$([C](F)(F)[F])][CX4;$([C](F)(F)[F])][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
      ```

- **Suggestion 9**: **Adjust Rule 9 to correctly account for multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate.**

  - **Issue**: The current implementation uses a count threshold but may not accurately count hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid.

  - **Recommendation**: Use substructure searches to find multiple hydroxyl groups within a certain distance from the carboxylic acid.

    - **Revised Implementation**:
      - Use molecular fingerprints or graph traversal to identify hydroxyl groups within two bonds of the carboxylate.
      - Alternatively, define a SMARTS pattern that includes multiple hydroxyl groups:
        ```python
        multiple_hydroxyls_near_carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]'
        ```

- **Suggestion 10**: **Clarify the patterns in Rule 10 to distinguish between aromatic and aliphatic thiols and aldehydes.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern may not accurately identify para-substituted thiol or aldehyde groups on aromatic rings.

  - **Recommendation**: Use specific patterns to detect para-substituted thiol or aldehyde groups on aromatic carboxylic acids.

    - **Revised Patterns**:
      - Aromatic carboxylic acid with para thiol: `c1ccc(S)cc1C(=O)[OX2H1]`
      - Aromatic carboxylic acid with para aldehyde: `c1ccc(C=O)cc1C(=O)[OX2H1]`

    - **Implementation**:
      ```python
      aromatic_thiol = 'c1ccc(S)cc1C(=O)[OX2H1]'
      aromatic_aldehyde = 'c1ccc(C=O)cc1C(=O)[OX2H1]'
      ```
    - **Exclude Patterns**: Ensure that aliphatic counterparts are not matched by these patterns.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Implement aromaticity correctly in SMARTS patterns to avoid mismatches.**

  - **Issue**: The use of `[c]` and `[n]` in SMARTS patterns assumes default aromaticity perception, which may vary.

  - **Recommendation**: Use the `Chem.MolFromSmarts` function with explicit aromaticity wherever necessary or standardize aromaticity in molecules before matching.

    - **Implementation**:
      ```python
      mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi)
      Chem.Kekulize(mol, clearAromaticFlags=True)
      ```

- **Suggestion 12**: **Standardize molecule representations before substructure searching.**

  - **Issue**: Tautomerism, protonation states, and stereochemistry may affect substructure matching.

  - **Recommendation**: Use standardized forms of molecules, possibly applying tools like RDKit's `MolStandardize`, to ensure consistent matching.

    - **Implementation**:
      ```python
      from rdkit.Chem import MolStandardize
      normalizer = MolStandardize.normalize.Normalizer()
      mol = normalizer.normalize(mol)
      ```

- **Suggestion 13**: **Include error handling and logging for unmatched molecules.**

  - **Issue**: Currently, molecules that cannot be parsed are assigned zeros without diagnostic information.

  - **Recommendation**: Implement logging to record SMILES that could not be parsed or any exceptions during matching for easier debugging.

    - **Implementation**:
      ```python
      if mol is None:
          # Log unparsed SMILES
          logger.warning(f"Could not parse SMILES: {smi}")
          results.append([0]*len(rules))
          continue
      ```

- **Suggestion 14**: **Test and validate the updated SMARTS patterns against known examples.**

  - **Issue**: Without testing, it's unclear if the new patterns work as intended.

  - **Recommendation**: Create a test suite with molecules known to match or not match each rule to validate the effectiveness of the SMARTS patterns.

    - **Implementation**:
      - Compile lists of SMILES for positive and negative examples for each rule.
      - Run the code and verify that the rules correctly predict the outcomes for these examples.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**Overview:**

We have been iteratively refining our set of rules to predict high or low yields in the catalytic reaction. The focus is on improving the **confidence** and **lift** of the rules, as these metrics indicate the reliability and strength of the associations identified.

**Reference Metrics (Baseline):**

- **Train Confidence**: Average of approximately **0.587**
- **Train Lift**: Average of approximately **1.13**

These values serve as a baseline for comparing the performance of the current rules.

**Current Iteration Metrics:**

- **Train Support**: **0.0629** (6.29%)
- **Train Confidence**: **0.75**
- **Train Lift**: **1.492**
- **Train Leverage**: **0.0057**

---

**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Confidence Improvement:**

   - The current **train confidence** is **0.75**, which is a significant improvement over the baseline average of **0.587**.
   - **Interpretation**: This means that when the conditions of the current rules are met, there is a 75% chance that the prediction (high or low yield) is correct on the training data.
   - **Implication**: A higher confidence indicates that our rules are becoming more reliable in predicting the outcome when applied.

2. **Lift Enhancement:**

   - The current **train lift** is **1.492**, an improvement from the baseline average of **1.13**.
   - **Interpretation**: A lift greater than 1 suggests that the rule has a stronger association than would be expected by chance.
   - **Implication**: The higher lift indicates that the presence of the rule conditions significantly increases the likelihood of the predicted outcome, making the rules more interesting and valuable.

3. **Support Considerations:**

   - **Train support** is **0.0629**, lower than the baseline support values (approximately 16.67% to 18.45%).
   - **Interpretation**: The rules apply to about 6.29% of the training data.
   - **Implication**: While the rules are more confident and have higher lift, they cover a smaller portion of the data, potentially limiting their general applicability.

4. **Leverage Observations:**

   - The **train leverage** is **0.0057**, which is lower than some previous iterations but still positive.
   - **Interpretation**: Positive leverage indicates a stronger association than expected by chance, but the value is relatively small.
   - **Implication**: The rules are identifying associations, but the incremental gain over random chance is modest.

---

**Progression Over Iterations:**

- **Confidence and Lift Trends**:

  - **Iteration 1**: Confidence = 0.711, Lift = 1.420
  - **Iteration 2**: Confidence = 0.718, Lift = 1.445
  - **Iteration 3**: Confidence = 0.633, Lift = 1.271
  - **Current Iteration**: Confidence = 0.75, Lift = 1.492

- **Observations**:

  - **Increasing Confidence and Lift**: The current iteration shows the highest confidence and lift so far, indicating that the rules are improving in predictive strength.
  - **Fluctuating Support**: Support values vary, with the current iteration being lower than previous ones.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency:**

- **Local Minimum Consideration**:

  - **Definition**: A local minimum in this context refers to a point where further iterations do not result in significant improvements in the performance metrics.
  - **Analysis**:

    - The current metrics show improvements in confidence and lift, suggesting that we have not yet reached a local minimum.
    - However, the decrease in support may indicate that we are refining the rules to be more specialized, potentially at the expense of general applicability.

- **Iteration Sufficiency**:

  - Given the ongoing improvements in key metrics, additional iterations may still yield better or more generalized rules.
  - It's essential to balance high confidence and lift with adequate support to ensure the rules are both reliable and broadly applicable.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Enhance Rule Support**:

   - **Objective**: Increase the proportion of data covered by the rules without sacrificing confidence and lift.
   - **Approach**:

     - **Generalize Overly Specific Rules**: Review rules that might be too narrow and identify opportunities to broaden their conditions.
     - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge rules with overlapping conditions to create more comprehensive rules with higher support.

2. **Balance Specificity and Generalization**:

   - **Objective**: Maintain high confidence and lift while ensuring the rules are not overly specialized.
   - **Approach**:

     - **Analyze Exceptions**: Look for modifiers that the current rules exclude but could be included without significantly lowering confidence.
     - **Adjust Thresholds**: Consider slight adjustments to the conditions to include more examples.

3. **Re-express Complex Rules**:

   - **Objective**: Simplify complex rules to make them more interpretable and widely applicable.
   - **Approach**:

     - **Simplify Language**: Use more general descriptors where possible (e.g., "small polar groups" instead of listing specific functional groups).
     - **Group Functionalities**: Identify common functional groups or structural motifs that contribute to high yields.

4. **Validate Against Test Data**:

   - **Objective**: Ensure that the improvements generalize beyond the training data.
   - **Approach**:

     - Apply the current rules to a separate test dataset to evaluate their performance.
     - Compare test confidence and lift to training metrics to assess overfitting.

5. **Incorporate Negative Examples**:

   - **Objective**: Strengthen the rules by understanding why certain modifiers lead to low yields.
   - **Approach**:

     - Analyze modifiers that consistently result in low yields and determine if they share common features not yet captured.
     - Modify existing rules to include these additional conditions, enhancing predictive accuracy.

6. **Leverage Domain Expertise**:

   - **Objective**: Use chemical knowledge to inform rule adjustments.
   - **Approach**:

     - Consult with chemists to identify any overlooked factors that could influence the reaction yield.
     - Incorporate insights about reaction mechanisms, steric effects, and electronic factors into the rules.

7. **Monitor Overfitting Risks**:

   - **Objective**: Ensure that the rules are not too tailored to the training data.
   - **Approach**:

     - Regularly evaluate the rules on validation datasets.
     - Introduce cross-validation techniques to assess the stability of the rules.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current rules show promising improvements in both confidence and lift, indicating that they are becoming more effective at predicting high or low yields in the catalytic reaction. However, the decrease in support suggests that the rules are applying to fewer cases, which may limit their utility.

To enhance the current rules:

- **Aim for a balance** between specificity (high confidence and lift) and generality (adequate support).
- **Continue iterating** with adjustments focused on increasing support without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
- **Validate** the rules against new data to ensure they maintain performance and are not overfitted.

By implementing these recommendations, we can develop a more robust set of rules that are both reliable and broadly applicable, ultimately contributing to more efficient catalyst design and reaction optimization.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the current classification model achieved an accuracy of **0.4857** on the 5-fold cross-validation set. This is a significant decrease compared to the previous reference accuracies, which ranged from **0.76** to **0.7714** for validation accuracy and up to **0.75** on the test set.

**Comparison with Reference Metrics:**

- **Previous Accuracies:**
  - Validation Accuracy ranged from **0.68** to **0.76**.
  - Test Accuracy ranged from **0.625** to **0.75**.
- **Current Accuracy:**
  - Validation Accuracy is **0.4857**.

The drop in accuracy indicates that the current set of rules may not be effective enough in capturing the underlying patterns that differentiate high and low loading modifiers. The performance is close to random guessing (which would be around **0.5** for a binary classification problem), suggesting issues with the model's predictive capability.

---

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

The substantial decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the model may be **underfitting** the data. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data. In this context, the current rules might be too generalized or not sufficiently capturing critical features necessary for accurate predictions.

Alternatively, the decrease in accuracy could also stem from changes in the rules that have led to a loss of important information previously captured, implying that recent rule modifications may have negatively impacted the model's ability to generalize from the training data.

---

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into how each rule (feature) contributes to the prediction for each molecule. By analyzing the SHAP values, we can identify which rules are influencing the model's decisions and where discrepancies occur.

**Identifying Discrepancies:**

1. **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - Molecules where the model predicts low loading but the experimental value is high indicate that important features are not being captured effectively.
   - For these molecules, the rules with the most **negative SHAP values** are likely contributing to the underprediction.
   - **Examples:**
     - **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
       - Significant negative SHAP values: Rule 1 (`-0.01931`), Rule 2 (`-0.01933`), Rule 5 (`-0.01937`).
     - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**
       - Similar pattern with negative SHAP contributions from the same rules.
   - These rules may be overly penalizing these molecules, leading to misclassification.

2. **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - Molecules where the model predicts high loading but the experimental value is low suggest that certain features are causing overprediction.
   - For these molecules, the rules with the most **positive SHAP values** are likely contributing to the overprediction.
   - **Examples:**
     - **C(CCN)CC(=O)O**
       - Positive SHAP contributions from Rule 7 (`0.01814`), Rule 10 (`0.01813`).
     - **CC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
       - Positive SHAP contributions may be leading to incorrect high loading prediction.

**Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- **Rule 1**, **Rule 2**, and **Rule 5** consistently have negative SHAP values contributing to underpredictions in several molecules where the experimental loading is high.
- **Rule 7** and **Rule 10** show positive SHAP values contributing to overprediction in molecules where the experimental loading is low.

---

**Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics and Improvement Probability**

The decrease in accuracy suggests that the current rules are not effectively capturing the necessary features for accurate prediction. Given that the validation accuracy has decreased to approximately **48.57%**, there is a high probability that refining the rules could lead to improvements.

- The model may benefit from revisiting the rules that are contributing to incorrect predictions, as identified by the SHAP analysis.
- The low accuracy indicates that the model is not overfitting (which would show high training accuracy but low validation accuracy) but is more likely underfitting, signaling the need for more nuanced or additional rules.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to improve the current rules:

1. **Refine Rules with High Negative SHAP Values (Underestimations):**

   - **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**:
     - These rules are contributing significant negative SHAP values in cases where the model underpredicts the loading.
     - **Action**:
       - Re-evaluate the conditions in these rules to ensure they are not overly restrictive.
       - Consider modifying the criteria to capture additional functional groups or structural features that may lead to high loading.

   - **Rule 5**:
     - Also contributing negatively in underestimations.
     - **Action**:
       - Assess whether the flexibility and steric considerations in Rule 5 are appropriately defined.
       - Adjust the rule to better account for molecules that may have flexible chains but are being penalized.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Positive SHAP Values (Overestimations):**

   - **Rule 7**:
     - Contributes to overestimations in molecules with low experimental loading.
     - **Action**:
       - Re-express the rule to more accurately capture the effect of fluorination.
       - Consider specifying the degree of fluorination or the position of fluorine atoms in the molecule.

   - **Rule 10**:
     - Positive SHAP values leading to overprediction.
     - **Action**:
       - Clarify the conditions under which aliphatic counterparts with coordinating groups lead to high yield.
       - Ensure the rule differentiates effectively between aromatic and aliphatic systems.

3. **Enhance Generalization to Address Underfitting:**

   - Introduce additional rules that capture missing patterns or features not currently represented.
   - Consider combining or simplifying rules where overlap occurs to reduce complexity.
   - Use domain knowledge to identify important molecular descriptors that may improve model performance.

4. **Leverage SHAP Insights to Refine Rules:**

   - Use SHAP analysis to identify features that are not currently included in the rules but have a significant impact on the predictions.
   - For example, if certain molecular substructures consistently contribute to high or low loading, consider incorporating them into new or existing rules.

5. **Validate Rule Modifications Iteratively:**

   - After adjusting the rules, re-train the model and evaluate the performance to ensure that changes lead to improvements.
   - Use cross-validation to assess the generalizability of the model with the updated rules.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules is not sufficiently effective, as indicated by the decreased validation accuracy and insights from the SHAP analysis. By refining rules associated with significant misclassifications and enhancing the model's ability to generalize, it is possible to improve predictive performance.

Key areas for improvement include:

- Revisiting **Rule 1**, **Rule 2**, and **Rule 5** to reduce underestimations.
- Adjusting **Rule 7** and **Rule 10** to prevent overestimations.
- Incorporating additional molecular features identified through SHAP analysis that may enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

By systematically refining the rules and validating changes through iterative training and evaluation, the model's accuracy is likely to improve, leading to more reliable predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

---

**Overview:**

The current task involves optimizing a set of rules designed to predict the yield (high or low) of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols. The catalyst system involves FeCl₃ captured and stabilized by a modified Metal Organic Layer (Hf-TPY-MOL), where the modifier's structural features significantly impact the reaction's yield.

**Current Model Performance:**

- **Validation Accuracy Decrease:** The latest model iteration shows a validation accuracy of **48.57%**, a significant drop from previous accuracies of **68% to 77%**.
- **SHAP Analysis Insights:** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis indicates that certain rules are contributing adversely to the model's predictions, leading to misclassifications.

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Underfitting:** The decrease in accuracy suggests that the current model may be underfitting, failing to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
2. **Ineffective Rules:** Some rules may be too restrictive or not accurately capturing the essential structural features influencing the yield.
3. **Negative SHAP Contributions:** Key rules (e.g., Rule 1, Rule 2, Rule 5) are contributing negative SHAP values in cases where high yield is expected but predicted as low.
4. **Positive SHAP Contributions to Overprediction:** Rules like Rule 7 and Rule 10 are contributing positive SHAP values, leading to overprediction of high yield in cases where the experimental yield is low.

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Revise SMARTS Patterns:**

   - **Rule 1 (Alpha and Beta Amino Acids):** Update SMARTS patterns to accurately identify alpha and beta amino carboxylic acids.
     - **Action:** Modify patterns to capture common amino acid structures with amino groups at alpha or beta positions.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) groups at the alpha (α) or beta (β) positions lead to **high yield**; when the amino group is further away or there are bulky groups, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Amino groups near the carboxylate can chelate metal centers effectively, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant amino groups or bulky substituents reduce coordination efficiency due to decreased chelation and increased steric hindrance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at γ position but still close enough for coordination.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group is distant, and acetamido group adds steric bulk.)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate.)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para or meta positions lead to **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents or interfering groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate by stabilizing the negative charge, enhancing interaction with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination, while interfering groups may block coordination sites or engage in side reactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing.)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl is electron-withdrawing.)*
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group can act as an additional coordination site.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating.)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group is electron-donating.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring lead to **high yield**; if the heterocycle is a substituent on a benzene ring or there is steric hindrance, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment allows lone pairs on heteroatoms to participate in coordination, enhancing catalyst interaction. Attachment via a benzene ring increases distance and steric hindrance, reducing effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate attached directly to pyridine ring.)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate attached to pyrazole ring.)*

      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(True)* *(Exception due to flexible aliphatic chain reducing steric effects.)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**; if these groups are distant or if interfering groups are present, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups close to the carboxylate can chelate metal centers, enhancing coordination and stability. Distant groups are less effective, and interfering groups may block coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol at β position enhances coordination.)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls near carboxylate enable chelation.)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains connecting coordinating groups to the carboxylic acid lead to **high yield**; those with rigid structures or bulky substituents near the coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Flexibility allows the modifier to adapt for optimal interaction with the catalyst. Rigid or bulky structures hinder access to coordination sites due to steric effects.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain and phenolic hydroxyl aid coordination.)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Long, flexible aliphatic chain.)*

      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with polyether chains in the dataset.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids lead to **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindering groups near the carboxylate or coordinating functional groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes the effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky side chains hinder coordination.)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**; those with single distant hydroxyl groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups can form strong coordination complexes with metal centers through chelation. Single hydroxyl groups far from the carboxylate are less effective in coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Gluconic acid with adjacent hydroxyls.)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted thiol (–SH), aldehyde (–CHO), or other potentially interfering groups lead to **low yield**; their aliphatic counterparts with these groups near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aromatic systems, these groups may participate in side reactions or resonance structures that reduce coordination effectiveness. In aliphatic acids, these groups can coordinate effectively when near the carboxylate.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol on aromatic ring less effective.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde may engage in side reactions.)*

Rule Generator Message:
---

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (–NH₂) at the alpha (α) or beta (β) position lead to a **high yield**; when the amino group is at a more distant position (gamma (γ) or beyond), or when bulky groups are present near the amino group, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylate allows for effective bidentate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant amino groups or steric hindrance from bulky substituents reduce coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at α position enhances coordination)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at α position enhances coordination)*

    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group withdraws electron density)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde may interfere with coordination)*
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol may engage in side reactions)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional coordinating groups, such as hydroxyl (–OH) or thiol (–SH), located near the carboxylate (α or β positions) lead to a **high yield**; if these groups are distant or absent, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Additional coordinating groups near the carboxylate can form chelate rings with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity and catalytic activity. Distant groups are less effective for coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group at β position enhances chelation)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls enable strong chelation)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(High yield despite lack of additional groups—may act as a baseline)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; if the heterocycle is attached via a linker or substituent, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment allows the lone pair on the nitrogen atom to participate in metal coordination alongside the carboxylate. Linkers increase distance and steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate directly attached to pyridine ring)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Effective coordination via heterocycle)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene reduces coordination)*
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Aromatic ring not directly attached to carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible chains bearing coordinating groups (e.g., phenolic –OH, amino –NH₂) lead to a **high yield**; rigid structures or bulky substituents near the coordinating groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Flexibility allows the molecule to adopt conformations that facilitate effective coordination with the catalyst. Rigid or bulky groups hinder access to coordination sites due to steric effects.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain with phenolic –OH enhances coordination)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Long flexible chain may assist in molecular interactions)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group causes steric hindrance)*
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Rigid aromatic side chain reduces flexibility)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that contain multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and solvation, which may result in the modifier wrapping around metal centers and reducing the availability of active sites. They can also sequester metal ions, decreasing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Polyether chain reduces coordination with catalyst)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple ether linkages hinder effective coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with polyether chains in the dataset)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids or contain highly fluorinated groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density, reducing the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen atoms and weakening their ability to coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple fluorines diminish coordination ability)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)* *(Fluorinated acyl group reduces electron density)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Non-fluorinated analogue shows high yield)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with interfering groups at the para position (e.g., aldehyde (–CHO), thiol (–SH)) lead to a **low yield**; if these groups are in aliphatic chains near the carboxylate, they can lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aromatic systems, these groups may participate in side reactions or hinder coordination due to resonance stabilization. In aliphatic systems, proximity to the carboxylate allows cooperative coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may engage in unwanted reactions)*
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol on aromatic ring may interfere with coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol near carboxylate enhances coordination in aliphatic chain)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group or coordinating functional groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center, reducing coordination and catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group near coordinating amino group)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky benzoyl group hinders coordination)*
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Indole ring may introduce steric hindrance, but still shows high yield possibly due to π-π interactions)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(No bulky groups near carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups lead to a **high yield**; however, the absence of any functional groups capable of enhancing coordination may limit further improvements.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple carboxylic acids can still coordinate with metal centers, but lack of additional coordinating groups means they rely solely on the carboxylate for interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Simple aliphatic acid shows high yield)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **No low-yield examples with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids in the dataset**

These rules elucidate how combinations of substructures and functional groups in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties—such as coordination ability, electron-withdrawing or -donating effects, steric hindrance, and the proximity of functional groups—these rules provide a predictive framework for assessing whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**: Focus on primary functional groups (amino and substituents on aromatic rings) and their positions relative to the carboxyl group.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 9**: Address the effects of molecular flexibility and steric hindrance, which are broadly applicable.
  - **Rule 10**: Highlights the role of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids as effective modifiers.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 3** and **Rule 4**: Discuss specific positioning of coordinating groups and heterocyclic systems.
  - **Rule 6** and **Rule 7**: Consider the impact of polyether chains and fluorination, which affect coordination in nuanced ways.
  - **Rule 8**: Explores how functional groups can have different effects depending on their context within the molecule.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the performance of various molecular modifiers and design new modifiers to optimize the reaction yield. The balance between simple, high-coverage rules and more specific, detailed rules allows for both broad applications and fine-tuning based on molecular structure.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows for unambiguous classification based on the position of the amino group in aliphatic carboxylic acids. The physicochemical insight is strong, explaining how proximity of the amino group to the carboxylate facilitates bidentate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. The rule incorporates combinations of substructures—carboxylic acid, amino group position, and steric effects from bulky groups—fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by multiple high-yield and low-yield examples, providing solid coverage and achieving a good balance between complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** provides a clear guideline by linking the electronic nature of substituents at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids to reaction yield. The physicochemical insight is adequate, explaining how electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination through increased acidity, while electron-donating groups have the opposite effect. It considers combinations of substructures, satisfying the complexity requirement. The rule is well-supported by multiple examples of both high and low yields, offering excellent coverage and a balanced approach.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear in its description of how additional coordinating groups near the carboxylate affect yield. The physicochemical insight is sound, highlighting the role of chelation in enhancing binding affinity. However, there is an inconsistency with **octanoic acid**, which lacks additional coordinating groups but still shows a high yield. This contradiction suggests that the rule may not fully account for all factors influencing the reaction, affecting its coverage and balance. The rule does consider combinations of substructures but may need refinement to address exceptions.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear and provides a logical connection between the presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group and high yield. The physicochemical reasoning is solid, emphasizing the role of nitrogen lone pairs in coordination. It effectively combines substructures, meeting the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by several examples with both high and low yields, ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** clearly differentiates modifiers based on chain flexibility and the presence of coordinating groups. The physicochemical insight is adequate, explaining how flexibility facilitates coordination and how steric hindrance from bulky groups can impede it. The rule considers multiple substructures, including chain length and functional groups, satisfying the complexity requirement. It is supported by sufficient examples of both high and low yields, providing good coverage and a balanced approach.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear in stating that modifiers with multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to low yields. The physicochemical insight is reasonable, discussing how such structures can sequester metal ions or reduce active site availability. While the rule lacks high-yield examples with polyether chains (since none are present in the dataset), the consistent low-yield outcomes provide adequate coverage. The rule is specific but maintains a good balance due to its clear applicability within its defined scope.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** provides clear criteria regarding the effect of perfluorination on yield. The physicochemical insight is strong, explaining how highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduce coordination ability. The rule focuses on specific substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by examples of low-yield fluorinated modifiers and a high-yield non-fluorinated analogue, ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is clear but somewhat complex, distinguishing the effects of interfering groups based on whether they are in aromatic or aliphatic contexts. The physicochemical insight is adequate, explaining how resonance and side reactions can impact yield. The rule considers the combination of functional group type, position, and molecular context, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by examples of both high and low yields, providing sufficient coverage and a balanced approach.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear in linking bulky substituents near coordinating groups to low yields. The physicochemical reasoning is valid, highlighting steric hindrance effects. However, there is a contradiction with **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**, which, despite having a bulky indole group, shows a high yield. This inconsistency suggests that the rule may not fully capture all factors influencing yield, such as possible favorable π-π interactions overriding steric hindrance. The rule meets the complexity criterion but has limited coverage due to unaddressed exceptions, affecting its balance.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear and straightforward, stating that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids lead to high yields. The physicochemical insight is acceptable but acknowledges the limitations due to the absence of additional coordinating groups. The rule is simple, perhaps too much so, and is based on a single supporting example (**octanoic acid**), affecting its coverage. While it satisfies the complexity criterion in terms of simplicity, the lack of broader supporting data limits its effectiveness and balance.

Current rules:
---

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (–NH₂) at the alpha (α) or beta (β) position lead to a **high yield**; when the amino group is at a more distant position (gamma (γ) or beyond), or when bulky groups are present near the amino group, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylate allows for effective bidentate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant amino groups or steric hindrance from bulky substituents reduce coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at α position enhances coordination)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at α position enhances coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group distant and acetamido group adds steric bulk)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate reduces chelation)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)* *(Reduced coordination due to distance)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position lead to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents or interfering groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, while interfering groups may engage in side reactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group withdraws electron density)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde may interfere with coordination)*
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol may engage in side reactions)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional coordinating groups, such as hydroxyl (–OH) or thiol (–SH), located near the carboxylate (α or β positions) lead to a **high yield**; if these groups are distant or absent, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Additional coordinating groups near the carboxylate can form chelate rings with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity and catalytic activity. Distant groups are less effective for coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group at β position enhances chelation)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls enable strong chelation)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(High yield despite lack of additional groups—may act as a baseline)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; if the heterocycle is attached via a linker or substituent, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment allows the lone pair on the nitrogen atom to participate in metal coordination alongside the carboxylate. Linkers increase distance and steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate directly attached to pyridine ring)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Effective coordination via heterocycle)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene reduces coordination)*
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Aromatic ring not directly attached to carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible chains bearing coordinating groups (e.g., phenolic –OH, amino –NH₂) lead to a **high yield**; rigid structures or bulky substituents near the coordinating groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Flexibility allows the molecule to adopt conformations that facilitate effective coordination with the catalyst. Rigid or bulky groups hinder access to coordination sites due to steric effects.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain with phenolic –OH enhances coordination)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Long flexible chain may assist in molecular interactions)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group causes steric hindrance)*
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Rigid aromatic side chain reduces flexibility)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that contain multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and solvation, which may result in the modifier wrapping around metal centers and reducing the availability of active sites. They can also sequester metal ions, decreasing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Polyether chain reduces coordination with catalyst)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple ether linkages hinder effective coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with polyether chains in the dataset)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids or contain highly fluorinated groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density, reducing the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen atoms and weakening their ability to coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple fluorines diminish coordination ability)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)* *(Fluorinated acyl group reduces electron density)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Non-fluorinated analogue shows high yield)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with interfering groups at the para position (e.g., aldehyde (–CHO), thiol (–SH)) lead to a **low yield**; if these groups are in aliphatic chains near the carboxylate, they can lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aromatic systems, these groups may participate in side reactions or hinder coordination due to resonance stabilization. In aliphatic systems, proximity to the carboxylate allows cooperative coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may engage in unwanted reactions)*
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol on aromatic ring may interfere with coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol near carboxylate enhances coordination in aliphatic chain)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group or coordinating functional groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center, reducing coordination and catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group near coordinating amino group)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky benzoyl group hinders coordination)*
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Indole ring may introduce steric hindrance, but still shows high yield possibly due to π-π interactions)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(No bulky groups near carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups lead to a **high yield**; however, the absence of any functional groups capable of enhancing coordination may limit further improvements.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple carboxylic acids can still coordinate with metal centers, but lack of additional coordinating groups means they rely solely on the carboxylate for interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Simple aliphatic acid shows high yield)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **No low-yield examples with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids in the dataset**

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules elucidate how combinations of substructures and functional groups in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties—such as coordination ability, electron-withdrawing or -donating effects, steric hindrance, and the proximity of functional groups—these rules provide a predictive framework for assessing whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**: Focus on primary functional groups (amino and substituents on aromatic rings) and their positions relative to the carboxyl group.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 9**: Address the effects of molecular flexibility and steric hindrance, which are broadly applicable.
  - **Rule 10**: Highlights the role of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids as effective modifiers.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 3** and **Rule 4**: Discuss specific positioning of coordinating groups and heterocyclic systems.
  - **Rule 6** and **Rule 7**: Consider the impact of polyether chains and fluorination, which affect coordination in nuanced ways.
  - **Rule 8**: Explores how functional groups can have different effects depending on their context within the molecule.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the performance of various molecular modifiers and design new modifiers to optimize the reaction yield. The balance between simple, high-coverage rules and more specific, detailed rules allows for both broad applications and fine-tuning based on molecular structure.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Review and Correct SMARTS Patterns for Rule 1**

  The SMARTS patterns for Rule 1 in the code may not accurately capture all cases of aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the α or β position. The current patterns are:

  - `amino_alpha_carboxylic_acid = '[NX3H2][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`
  - `amino_beta_carboxylic_acid = '[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`

  **Issues:**

  - These patterns only match straight-chain structures and may miss molecules with branching or additional substituents.
  - They do not account for molecules where the amino group is connected via a nitrogen atom that is part of a ring or has substituents.
  - The patterns may not match molecules where the carboxylic acid is ionized (carboxylate form).

  **Suggestions:**

  - Use recursive SMARTS to allow for branching between the amino and carboxyl groups.
  - Include patterns that account for ionized carboxylic acids.
  - Modify the patterns to:

    ```python
    amino_alpha_carboxylic_acid = '[NX3H2][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]'
    amino_beta_carboxylic_acid = '[NX3H2][CX4H][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]'
    ```

  - Use a more general pattern:

    ```python
    amino_alpha_beta_carboxylic_acid = '[NX3H2][CX4][CX4]{0,1}[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]'
    ```

  This pattern matches compounds where the amino group is one or two carbons away from the carboxylic acid, accounting for both α and β positions, with flexibility for branching.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Generalize SMARTS Patterns for Rule 2**

  The current SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups at the para position may be too specific and miss valid matches. The patterns are:

  - `ewg_para_benzoic_acid = 'c1cc([F,Cl,Br,I,NX3+(=O)[O-]])ccc1C(=O)O'`
  - `edg_para_benzoic_acid = 'c1cc([CH3,OH,OC])ccc1C(=O)O'`

  **Issues:**

  - The patterns are limited to specific substituents and may not match other common electron-withdrawing/donating groups.
  - They may not account for variations in substituent bonding or additional atoms in substituents (e.g., nitro groups).

  **Suggestions:**

  - Use wildcard patterns for electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups.
  - Define SMARTS for generic EWG and EDG:

    ```python
    # Electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) at para position
    ewg_para_benzoic_acid = '[#6]1:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:1[C](=O)[O;H]'

    # Match any EWG at para position
    ewg_para_benzoic_acid = 'c1cc([$(N(=O)=O),$(C(=O)O),$(C#N),F,Cl,Br,I])ccc1C(=O)O'

    # Electron-donating groups (EDG) at para position
    edg_para_benzoic_acid = 'c1cc([$(OC),$(O[H]),$(N[H]2),$(N[H][H])]cc1C(=O)O'

    ```

  - Alternatively, define SMARTS for EWG and EDG substituents and integrate them into patterns:

    ```python
    # EWG definition
    electron_withdrawing_group = '[$(N(=O)=O),$(C(=O)O),$(C#N),$(S(=O)(=O)[OH])]'

    # EDG definition
    electron_donating_group = '[$(OC),$(O[H]),$(N[H]2),$(N[H][H]),$(CH3)]'

    # EWG at para position
    ewg_para_benzoic_acid = f'c1cc({electron_withdrawing_group})ccc1C(=O)O'

    # EDG at para position
    edg_para_benzoic_acid = f'c1cc({electron_donating_group})ccc1C(=O)O'
    ```

  - Ensure that the patterns account for different bonding scenarios and resonance structures.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Improve Patterns for Rule 3**

  The patterns for Rule 3 may not capture all aliphatic carboxylic acids with OH or SH groups near the carboxylate. Current patterns:

  - `oh_alpha_carboxylic_acid = '[OX2H][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`
  - `oh_beta_carboxylic_acid = '[OX2H][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`
  - Similarly for SH groups.

  **Issues:**

  - These patterns may miss compounds where the OH or SH group is on a substituted carbon.
  - The patterns do not allow for additional substituents on the carbon chain.

  **Suggestions:**

  - Use more flexible patterns that allow for substituents:

    ```python
    # OH or SH group one or two atoms away from carboxylic acid
    oh_sh_alpha_beta_carboxylic_acid = '[OX2H,SX2H][CX4][CX4]{0,1}[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]'
    ```

  - Allow for possible branching by using `[$([CX4H]),$([CX4][*!#1])]` to include substituted carbons.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Refine Pattern for Simple Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids in Rule 10**

  The pattern for simple aliphatic carboxylic acids may not exclude molecules with additional coordinating groups effectively. Current pattern:

  - `simple_aliphatic_carboxylic_acid = '[CH3][CH2]{4,}[C](=O)[OH]'`

  **Issues:**

  - The exclude patterns such as `'[OH]', '[SH]', '[N]', '[S]', '[OX2]', '[NX3]'` are too general and may not function as intended in the code.
  - Patterns like `'[OH]'` will match any hydroxyl group in the molecule, including the carboxylic acid.

  **Suggestions:**

  - Use atom maps or labels to differentiate between functional groups.
  - Redefine the exclude patterns to avoid matching the carboxylic acid group:

    ```python
    # Exclude patterns without including carboxylic acid oxygens
    exclude_patterns = ['[OH;!$(OC=O)]', '[SH]', '[NX3;!$(NC=O)]', '[SX2;!$(SC=O)]']
    ```

  - Adjust the SMARTS for the aliphatic chain to allow for varying chain lengths and ensure no other functional groups are present:

    ```python
    simple_aliphatic_carboxylic_acid = '[CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]'
    ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **Account for Ionization States and Tautomers**

  The code primarily searches for neutral forms of the functional groups, potentially missing ionized forms or tautomers.

  **Suggestions:**

  - Include both protonated and deprotonated forms of carboxylic acids and other functional groups in the SMARTS patterns:

    ```python
    carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]'
    ```

  - Use tautomeric SMARTS patterns or mol blocks to account for tautomerizable groups.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Improve Handling of Steric Hindrance in Rule 9**

  The pattern for bulky substituents near functional groups is currently:

  - `bulky_near_coordinating_group = '[#6][CX3](C([#6])([#6])[#6])[CX3](=O)[OH]'`

  **Issues:**

  - This pattern may not effectively capture all cases of steric hindrance.
  - It may miss molecules where bulky groups are present but not matching this specific pattern.

  **Suggestions:**

  - Define a generic pattern for bulky groups, such as tert-butyl or isopropyl:

    ```python
    bulky_group = '[CX4]([CX4H3])([CX4H3])[CX4H3]'  # Tert-butyl group
    ```

  - Modify the rule to search for bulky groups within a certain number of bonds from the functional group:

    ```python
    # Bulky group near carboxyl group
    bulky_near_coordinating_group = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][CX4][C;X4](~[#6]{3,})'
    ```

  - Use SMARTS with recursive patterns to capture steric hindrance more effectively.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Validate Patterns Against Known Examples**

  The code should be tested and validated using the supporting examples provided in the rules.

  **Suggestions:**

  - Create unit tests for each rule using the supporting examples.
  - Use RDKit to check if the SMARTS patterns match the molecules as intended:

    ```python
    from rdkit import Chem

    # Example molecule
    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles('CC(C)C(C(=O)O)N')

    # Pattern to test
    pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts(amino_alpha_carboxylic_acid)

    # Test
    mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern)
    ```

  - Adjust the SMARTS patterns based on the test results to ensure they match all supporting examples correctly.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Enhance Patterns for Rule 4**

  For nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group, the pattern may be too general or missing specifics.

  **Suggestions:**

  - Define specific heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) and ensure the pattern captures the attachment directly to the carboxyl group:

    ```python
    # Heterocycle directly attached to carboxylic acid
    heterocycle_carboxylic_acid = '[n][c]1cccc1C(=O)[O;H]'
    ```

  - Use more specific patterns for common heterocycles, or create a set of patterns for different heterocycles.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Refine Patterns for Polyether Chains in Rule 6**

  The current pattern for polyether chains is:

  - `polyether_chain = '[#6]-([OX2]-[#6]){2,}'`

  **Issues:**

  - This pattern may not match molecules as intended due to the placement and repetition syntax.

  **Suggestions:**

  - Use quantifiers correctly in SMARTS syntax:

    ```python
    # Match two or more ether linkages in a chain
    polyether_chain = '[#6](-[OX2]-[#6]){2,}'
    ```

  - Ensure the pattern matches continuous chains of ether linkages.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Implement Exclusion Patterns Correctly**

  Some rules require excluding certain structures or functional groups.

  **Suggestions:**

  - In rules with `exclude_patterns`, ensure that the logic in the code correctly handles exclusions.
  - Adjust the code to skip to the next rule if an exclude pattern matches:

    ```python
    for pat in rule.get('compiled_exclude_patterns', []):
        if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat):
            match = False
            break  # Exclude the molecule from this rule
    ```

  - Ensure the exclusion patterns are specific enough to avoid unintended exclusions.

Current rules:
---

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (–NH₂) at the alpha (α) or beta (β) position lead to a **high yield**; when the amino group is at a more distant position (gamma (γ) or beyond), or when bulky groups are present near the amino group, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylate allows for effective bidentate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant amino groups or steric hindrance from bulky substituents reduce coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at α position enhances coordination)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at α position enhances coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group distant and acetamido group adds steric bulk)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate reduces chelation)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)* *(Reduced coordination due to distance)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position lead to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents or interfering groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, while interfering groups may engage in side reactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group withdraws electron density)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde may interfere with coordination)*
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol may engage in side reactions)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional coordinating groups, such as hydroxyl (–OH) or thiol (–SH), located near the carboxylate (α or β positions) lead to a **high yield**; if these groups are distant or absent, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Additional coordinating groups near the carboxylate can form chelate rings with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity and catalytic activity. Distant groups are less effective for coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group at β position enhances chelation)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls enable strong chelation)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(High yield despite lack of additional groups—may act as a baseline)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; if the heterocycle is attached via a linker or substituent, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment allows the lone pair on the nitrogen atom to participate in metal coordination alongside the carboxylate. Linkers increase distance and steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate directly attached to pyridine ring)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Effective coordination via heterocycle)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene reduces coordination)*
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Aromatic ring not directly attached to carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible chains bearing coordinating groups (e.g., phenolic –OH, amino –NH₂) lead to a **high yield**; rigid structures or bulky substituents near the coordinating groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Flexibility allows the molecule to adopt conformations that facilitate effective coordination with the catalyst. Rigid or bulky groups hinder access to coordination sites due to steric effects.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain with phenolic –OH enhances coordination)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Long flexible chain may assist in molecular interactions)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group causes steric hindrance)*
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Rigid aromatic side chain reduces flexibility)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that contain multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and solvation, which may result in the modifier wrapping around metal centers and reducing the availability of active sites. They can also sequester metal ions, decreasing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Polyether chain reduces coordination with catalyst)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple ether linkages hinder effective coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with polyether chains in the dataset)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids or contain highly fluorinated groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density, reducing the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen atoms and weakening their ability to coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple fluorines diminish coordination ability)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)* *(Fluorinated acyl group reduces electron density)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Non-fluorinated analogue shows high yield)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with interfering groups at the para position (e.g., aldehyde (–CHO), thiol (–SH)) lead to a **low yield**; if these groups are in aliphatic chains near the carboxylate, they can lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aromatic systems, these groups may participate in side reactions or hinder coordination due to resonance stabilization. In aliphatic systems, proximity to the carboxylate allows cooperative coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may engage in unwanted reactions)*
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol on aromatic ring may interfere with coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol near carboxylate enhances coordination in aliphatic chain)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group or coordinating functional groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center, reducing coordination and catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group near coordinating amino group)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky benzoyl group hinders coordination)*
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Indole ring may introduce steric hindrance, but still shows high yield possibly due to π-π interactions)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(No bulky groups near carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups lead to a **high yield**; however, the absence of any functional groups capable of enhancing coordination may limit further improvements.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple carboxylic acids can still coordinate with metal centers, but lack of additional coordinating groups means they rely solely on the carboxylate for interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Simple aliphatic acid shows high yield)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **No low-yield examples with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids in the dataset**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules elucidate how combinations of substructures and functional groups in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties—such as coordination ability, electron-withdrawing or -donating effects, steric hindrance, and the proximity of functional groups—these rules provide a predictive framework for assessing whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**: Focus on primary functional groups (amino and substituents on aromatic rings) and their positions relative to the carboxyl group.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 9**: Address the effects of molecular flexibility and steric hindrance, which are broadly applicable.
  - **Rule 10**: Highlights the role of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids as effective modifiers.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 3** and **Rule 4**: Discuss specific positioning of coordinating groups and heterocyclic systems.
  - **Rule 6** and **Rule 7**: Consider the impact of polyether chains and fluorination, which affect coordination in nuanced ways.
  - **Rule 8**: Explores how functional groups can have different effects depending on their context within the molecule.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the performance of various molecular modifiers and design new modifiers to optimize the reaction yield. The balance between simple, high-coverage rules and more specific, detailed rules allows for both broad applications and fine-tuning based on molecular structure.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: Modify the SMARTS patterns in the code to use quantifiers compatible with RDKit. The quantifiers `{m,n}` are not supported in RDKit's SMARTS implementation. Instead, use `?` for zero or one occurrences, `*` for zero or more, and `+` for one or more. For example:
  - Replace `"[CX4][CX4]{0,1}"` with `"[CX4]([CX4])?"` to represent zero or one `[CX4]` groups.
  - Replace `"[CX4][CX4]{2,}"` with `"[CX4][CX4]+"` to represent two or more `[CX4]` groups.
  - Adjust other patterns accordingly, such as `"[OX2H,SX2H][CX4]([CX4])?[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]"` for Rule 3 high yield.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Correct the syntax for electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) and electron-donating groups (EDG) in Rule 2. The use of `$()` within square brackets `[]` is improper in RDKit SMARTS. Instead, define EWG and EDG as SMARTS patterns without the brackets and `$()`. For example:
  - Define EWG as `"[$([NX3](=O)=O),$([CX3](=O)[OX1H0]),$([C]#N),$([SX4](=O)(=O)[OX1H0]),F,Cl,Br,I]"`.
  - Define EDG as `"[$([OX2][CH3]),$([OX2H]),$([NX3H2]),$([NX3H][CH3]),$([CH3])]"`.
  - Update the `ewg_para_benzoic_acid` and `edg_para_benzoic_acid` patterns to incorporate these corrected definitions.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Review all SMARTS patterns to ensure they accurately represent the chemical structures described in the rules. Some patterns may be too generic or might not capture the specific conditions outlined in the natural language rules. For example:
  - For Rule 4 high yield, ensure that the pattern matches nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group without unintended matches.
  - For Rule 5 high yield, the pattern for flexible aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups should explicitly include the coordinating groups (e.g., phenolic –OH, amino –NH₂) and account for chain flexibility.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Test each SMARTS pattern individually against known molecules to validate their correctness. Use sample SMILES strings from the supporting examples to see if the patterns correctly identify high-yield and low-yield modifiers according to the rules. This will help identify any mismatches or errors in the patterns.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Update the code to handle exceptions and provide informative error messages when a pattern fails to compile or a molecule cannot be parsed. This will aid in debugging and ensure that the feature matrix accurately reflects the application of the rules to the SMILES set.

Current rules:
---

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (–NH₂) at the alpha (α) or beta (β) position lead to a **high yield**; when the amino group is at a more distant position (gamma (γ) or beyond), or when bulky groups are present near the amino group, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylate allows for effective bidentate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant amino groups or steric hindrance from bulky substituents reduce coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at α position enhances coordination)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at α position enhances coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group distant and acetamido group adds steric bulk)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate reduces chelation)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)* *(Reduced coordination due to distance)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position lead to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents or interfering groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, while interfering groups may engage in side reactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group withdraws electron density)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde may interfere with coordination)*
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol may engage in side reactions)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional coordinating groups, such as hydroxyl (–OH) or thiol (–SH), located near the carboxylate (α or β positions) lead to a **high yield**; if these groups are distant or absent, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Additional coordinating groups near the carboxylate can form chelate rings with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity and catalytic activity. Distant groups are less effective for coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group at β position enhances chelation)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls enable strong chelation)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(High yield despite lack of additional groups—may act as a baseline)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; if the heterocycle is attached via a linker or substituent, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment allows the lone pair on the nitrogen atom to participate in metal coordination alongside the carboxylate. Linkers increase distance and steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate directly attached to pyridine ring)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Effective coordination via heterocycle)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene reduces coordination)*
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Aromatic ring not directly attached to carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible chains bearing coordinating groups (e.g., phenolic –OH, amino –NH₂) lead to a **high yield**; rigid structures or bulky substituents near the coordinating groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Flexibility allows the molecule to adopt conformations that facilitate effective coordination with the catalyst. Rigid or bulky groups hinder access to coordination sites due to steric effects.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain with phenolic –OH enhances coordination)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Long flexible chain may assist in molecular interactions)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group causes steric hindrance)*
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Rigid aromatic side chain reduces flexibility)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that contain multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and solvation, which may result in the modifier wrapping around metal centers and reducing the availability of active sites. They can also sequester metal ions, decreasing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Polyether chain reduces coordination with catalyst)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple ether linkages hinder effective coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with polyether chains in the dataset)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids or contain highly fluorinated groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density, reducing the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen atoms and weakening their ability to coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple fluorines diminish coordination ability)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)* *(Fluorinated acyl group reduces electron density)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Non-fluorinated analogue shows high yield)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with interfering groups at the para position (e.g., aldehyde (–CHO), thiol (–SH)) lead to a **low yield**; if these groups are in aliphatic chains near the carboxylate, they can lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aromatic systems, these groups may participate in side reactions or hinder coordination due to resonance stabilization. In aliphatic systems, proximity to the carboxylate allows cooperative coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may engage in unwanted reactions)*
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol on aromatic ring may interfere with coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol near carboxylate enhances coordination in aliphatic chain)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group or coordinating functional groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center, reducing coordination and catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group near coordinating amino group)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky benzoyl group hinders coordination)*
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Indole ring may introduce steric hindrance, but still shows high yield possibly due to π-π interactions)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(No bulky groups near carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups lead to a **high yield**; however, the absence of any functional groups capable of enhancing coordination may limit further improvements.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple carboxylic acids can still coordinate with metal centers, but lack of additional coordinating groups means they rely solely on the carboxylate for interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Simple aliphatic acid shows high yield)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **No low-yield examples with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids in the dataset**

**End of Rules**

These rules elucidate how combinations of substructures and functional groups in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties—such as coordination ability, electron-withdrawing or -donating effects, steric hindrance, and the proximity of functional groups—these rules provide a predictive framework for assessing whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**: Focus on primary functional groups (amino and substituents on aromatic rings) and their positions relative to the carboxyl group.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 9**: Address the effects of molecular flexibility and steric hindrance, which are broadly applicable.
  - **Rule 10**: Highlights the role of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids as effective modifiers.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 3** and **Rule 4**: Discuss specific positioning of coordinating groups and heterocyclic systems.
  - **Rule 6** and **Rule 7**: Consider the impact of polyether chains and fluorination, which affect coordination in nuanced ways.
  - **Rule 8**: Explores how functional groups can have different effects depending on their context within the molecule.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the performance of various molecular modifiers and design new modifiers to optimize the reaction yield. The balance between simple, high-coverage rules and more specific, detailed rules allows for both broad applications and fine-tuning based on molecular structure.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Evaluation of the Feature Matrix:**

Upon examining the feature matrix, it is evident that all entries are zeros for every rule and every SMILES string. This suggests that none of the rules matched any of the modifiers in the provided SMILES list. Given that the dataset includes compounds that should match the rules, this indicates that the transformation from the language rules to the numeric feature matrix is not effective.

For instance:

- **Rule 1** (High yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the alpha or beta position):
  - **Modifier**: `'C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O'`
    - This SMILES represents **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**, which has an amino group at the alpha position relative to the carboxylic acid. According to Rule 1, this should result in a high yield and thus a value of **1** in the feature matrix. However, the feature matrix shows a **0** for this rule and modifier.
  
- **Rule 2** (High yield for aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position):
  - **Modifier**: `'C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)[N+](=O)[O-]'`
    - This SMILES represents **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, which has a nitro group (a strong electron-withdrawing group) at the para position. According to Rule 2, this should result in a high yield and a value of **1** in the feature matrix. However, the feature matrix shows a **0** for this rule and modifier.

Given these discrepancies, it is clear that the code is not accurately transforming the language rules into the feature matrix.

  - **Issue**: The SMARTS pattern for **Rule 1 high yield** may not correctly match molecules where the amino group is at the alpha or beta position relative to the carboxylic acid due to incorrect use of optional groupings.
  
  - **Recommendation**: Modify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 high yield to explicitly match amino groups at the alpha or beta positions. Separate the patterns for alpha and beta positions.
    - **Alpha position**: `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,O-]'` 
    - **Beta position**: `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,O-]'`
  
  - **Implementation**: Update the code to compile both patterns and check for matches against each SMILES string:

    ```python
    # Rule 1 high yield patterns
    amino_alpha_carboxylic_acid = '[NX3H2][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,O-]'
    amino_beta_carboxylic_acid = '[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,O-]'

    # Compile patterns
    rule1_high_patterns = [amino_alpha_carboxylic_acid, amino_beta_carboxylic_acid]
    compiled_patterns = [Chem.MolFromSmarts(pat) for pat in rule1_high_patterns]
    ```

- **Suggestion 2**:

  - **Issue**: The SMARTS pattern for **Rule 1 low yield** may not correctly match amino groups at gamma positions or beyond due to misuse of quantifiers and wildcards.

  - **Recommendation**: Use recursive SMARTS or more precise patterns to match amino groups at positions three or more carbons away from the carboxylic acid.
  
  - **Implementation**:

    ```python
    # Rule 1 low yield pattern
    amino_gamma_or_beyond_carboxylic_acid = '[NX3H2][C][C][C,]*[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,O-]'

    # Compile pattern
    compiled_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts(amino_gamma_or_beyond_carboxylic_acid)
    ```

    Alternatively, implement a function to calculate the distance between the amino nitrogen and the carboxyl carbon using RDKit's molecular graph capabilities.

- **Suggestion 3**:

  - **Issue**: The SMARTS patterns for **Rule 2** may not accurately specify substituents at the para position of a benzene ring due to the lack of position specifiers in the patterns.

  - **Recommendation**: Utilize SMARTS notation that specifies the para position on the benzene ring. This can be achieved by numbering the ring atoms and specifying the positions of the substituents.

  - **Implementation**:

    ```python
    # Example pattern for EWG at para position of benzoic acid
    ewg_para_benzoic_acid = 'c1cc(ccc1[N+](=O)[O-])C(=O)[OX1H1,O-]'

    # Compile pattern
    compiled_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts(ewg_para_benzoic_acid)
    ```

    Repeat for other electron-withdrawing groups, ensuring that substituents are specified at the correct positions.

- **Suggestion 4**:

  - **Issue**: The current code does not fully implement **Rule 3**, as the patterns may not correctly match modifiers with OH or SH groups at alpha or beta positions relative to the carboxylic acid.

  - **Recommendation**: Explicitly define separate SMARTS patterns for OH and SH groups at alpha and beta positions.

  - **Implementation**:

    ```python
    # Rule 3 high yield patterns
    oh_alpha_carboxylic_acid = '[OX2H][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,O-]'
    sh_alpha_carboxylic_acid = '[SX2H][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,O-]'
    oh_beta_carboxylic_acid = '[OX2H][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,O-]'
    sh_beta_carboxylic_acid = '[SX2H][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,O-]'

    # Compile patterns
    rule3_high_patterns = [oh_alpha_carboxylic_acid, sh_alpha_carboxylic_acid, oh_beta_carboxylic_acid, sh_beta_carboxylic_acid]
    compiled_patterns = [Chem.MolFromSmarts(pat) for pat in rule3_high_patterns]
    ```

- **Suggestion 5**:

  - **Issue**: The code currently implements only **Rules 1 to 3**, which limits the ability to capture matches for other rules.

  - **Recommendation**: Expand the code to include all ten rules provided. For each rule, carefully translate the natural language description into accurate SMARTS patterns or use RDKit's chemical features.

  - **Implementation**: Create a new entry in the `rules` list for each additional rule, defining the necessary patterns and predictions.

- **Suggestion 6**:

  - **Issue**: Determining the position of functional groups (e.g., alpha, beta, gamma) cannot always be accurately captured with SMARTS patterns alone due to limitations in specifying distances.

  - **Recommendation**: Use RDKit's molecular graph analysis to compute the shortest path between functional groups. Implement functions that calculate the distance between atoms and determine if a group is at the alpha, beta, or gamma position.

  - **Implementation**:

    ```python
    def is_group_at_position(mol, group_smarts, reference_smarts, position):
        group_atoms = mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts(group_smarts))
        reference_atoms = mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts(reference_smarts))
        distance_matrix = Chem.GetDistanceMatrix(mol)
        for ga in group_atoms:
            for ra in reference_atoms:
                distance = distance_matrix[ga[0], ra[0]]
                if distance == position:
                    return True
        return False
    ```

- **Suggestion 7**:

  - **Issue**: SMARTS patterns may not account for differences in tautomeric forms or resonance structures, potentially missing valid matches.

  - **Recommendation**: Where relevant, include additional SMARTS patterns to account for common tautomers or use RDKit's tautomer enumeration to standardize molecules before matching.

  - **Implementation**: Use RDKit's `TautomerEnumerator` to generate possible tautomers and attempt matching on each.

    ```python
    from rdkit.Chem import rdMolStandardize

    enumerator = rdMolStandardize.TautomerEnumerator()
    tautomers = enumerator.Enumerate(mol)
    for tautomer in tautomers:
        # Check for pattern matches on tautomer
        pass
    ```

- **Suggestion 8**:

  - **Issue**: Error handling in the code is minimal, which may lead to silent failures when parsing SMILES strings or compiling SMARTS patterns.

  - **Recommendation**: Implement robust error handling with informative messages for parsing and pattern matching failures to facilitate debugging.

  - **Implementation**:

    ```python
    try:
        mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi)
        if mol is None:
            raise ValueError(f"Cannot parse SMILES: {smi}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error parsing SMILES {smi}: {e}")
        results.append([0]*len(rules))
        continue
    ```

- **Suggestion 9**:

  - **Issue**: The code does not currently verify whether the compiled SMARTS patterns are valid and can potentially match structures.

  - **Recommendation**: Add validation checks for each compiled SMARTS pattern to ensure they are syntactically correct and capable of matching relevant substructures.

  - **Implementation**:

    ```python
    for rule in rules:
        for pat_str in rule.get('patterns', []):
            pat = Chem.MolFromSmarts(pat_str)
            if pat is None:
                raise ValueError(f"Invalid SMARTS pattern in Rule {rule['number']}: {pat_str}")
    ```

- **Suggestion 10**:

  - **Issue**: Without testing, it is difficult to confirm whether the SMARTS patterns accurately match the intended structures.

  - **Recommendation**: For each rule, create a set of test SMILES strings that should match (positive controls) and should not match (negative controls). Test the patterns against these SMILES to validate their accuracy.

  - **Implementation**: Write unit tests or a testing script that iterates over the test SMILES and checks for correct pattern matching.

By addressing these issues and implementing the recommendations, the code should more accurately transform the language rules into a numeric feature matrix that correctly reflects the structural descriptions of the modifiers and their predicted effects on yield.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**Overview**

The current set of rules has been developed to predict the yield outcome (high or low) based on the structural features of molecular modifiers. To assess their performance, we compare the current metrics to previous (reference) metrics, focusing on key indicators such as **support**, **confidence**, **lift**, and **leverage**. The primary goal is to achieve rules that are not only accurate (high confidence and lift) but also applicable to a significant portion of the dataset (high support).

---

**Comparison with Reference Metrics**

1. **Support**

   - **Reference Metrics**:
     - *Train Support*: ~0.175 (average of 0.1667 and 0.1845)
     - *Test Support*: ~0.109 (average of 0.0833 and 0.1354)
   - **Current Metrics (Per Rule)**:
     - *Rule 1*: 0.0514
     - *Rule 2*: 0.08
     - *Rule 3*: 0.0152
     - *Rule 4*: 0.0629
     - *Rule 10*: 0.0
   - **Observation**:
     - The current rules have **lower support** compared to the reference metrics. This indicates that the new rules apply to a smaller fraction of the dataset.

2. **Confidence**

   - **Reference Metrics**:
     - *Train Confidence*: ~0.5874 (average of 0.6352 and 0.5396)
     - *Test Confidence*: ~0.3986 (average of 0.3333 and 0.4639)
   - **Current Metrics (Per Rule)**:
     - *Rule 1*: 0.7114
     - *Rule 2*: 0.7184
     - *Rule 3*: 0.6333
     - *Rule 4*: 0.75
     - *Rule 10*: 0.5
   - **Observation**:
     - The current rules demonstrate **higher confidence** than the reference metrics, suggesting that when the rules apply, they are more likely to correctly predict the outcome.

3. **Lift**

   - **Reference Metrics**:
     - *Train Lift*: ~1.1304 (average of 1.2048 and 1.0559)
     - *Test Lift*: ~0.8013 (average of 0.6889 and 0.9137)
   - **Current Metrics (Per Rule)**:
     - *Rule 1*: 1.4199
     - *Rule 2*: 1.4454
     - *Rule 3*: 1.2710
     - *Rule 4*: 1.4923
     - *Rule 10*: 1.0
   - **Observation**:
     - The current rules have a **higher lift**, indicating that they are better at improving the prediction over random chance compared to the reference rules.

4. **Leverage**

   - **Reference Metrics**:
     - *Train Leverage*: ~0.0124 (average of 0.0289 and -0.0041)
     - *Test Leverage*: ~-0.0325 (average of -0.0312 and -0.0339)
   - **Current Metrics (Per Rule)**:
     - *Rule 1*: 0.0125
     - *Rule 2*: 0.0154
     - *Rule 3*: 0.0049
     - *Rule 4*: 0.0057
     - *Rule 10*: 0.0
   - **Observation**:
     - The leverage values are **positive and comparable** to the reference metrics, indicating that the rules provide additional predictive power over random chance.

---

**Assessment of Current Rule Performance**

1. **Strengths**

   - **High Confidence and Lift**: The current rules exhibit higher confidence and lift values compared to the reference metrics. This suggests that the rules are effective at correctly predicting high or low yields when they apply.
   - **Specificity**: The increased metrics indicate that the rules are capturing specific structural features that strongly correlate with the yield outcome.

2. **Weaknesses**

   - **Low Support**: The support values for the current rules are significantly lower than the reference metrics. This means that the rules apply to a smaller subset of the dataset, limiting their overall impact.
   - **Zero Support in Rule 10**: The current metrics for Rule 10 show a train support of 0.0, indicating that this rule does not apply to any instances in the training data. Additionally, the confidence is 0.5 and lift is 1.0, which imply no predictive power over random chance.
   - **Potential Overfitting**: The specificity of the rules may have led to overfitting, where the rules perform well on the training data for a small subset but may not generalize to new data.

---

**Determination of Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency**

- **Local Minimum Indicators**:
  - The increase in confidence and lift coupled with the decrease in support suggests that further iterations are refining the rules to be more precise but less general.
  - The occurrence of a rule with zero support indicates that the optimization process may have reached a point where additional iterations are yielding diminishing returns or creating overly specific rules.
- **Iteration Sufficiency**:
  - Since the support is decreasing and certain rules are no longer covering any data points, it appears that a local minimum has been reached.
  - Continuing iterations without adjusting the approach may not lead to significant improvements and could further reduce the applicability of the rules.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Balance Specificity and Generality**

   - **Broaden Rule Conditions**: Modify the rules to include slightly broader criteria that increase support while maintaining acceptable confidence and lift values.
   - **Merge Similar Rules**: Identify and combine rules that overlap or address similar structural features to improve support.

2. **Enhance Rule Support**

   - **Include More Examples**: Re-examine the dataset to find additional examples that fit the current rules or adjust the rules to cover more existing data points.
   - **Revisit Exclusion Criteria**: Assess whether certain exclusion criteria are unnecessarily limiting the support and adjust them accordingly.

3. **Avoid Overfitting**

   - **Simplify Rules**: Reduce complexity by focusing on the most impactful functional groups or structural features.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Employ cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data.

4. **Address Rules with Zero Support**

   - **Review Rule 10**:
     - Since Rule 10 currently has zero support, re-evaluate the conditions of this rule to ensure it aligns with actual data instances.
     - Possibly remove or revise the rule to reflect meaningful patterns in the dataset.

5. **Incorporate Negative Examples**

   - **Leverage Low Yield Cases**: Analyze modifiers that consistently lead to low yields to identify common features that can be integrated into the rules to improve distinction.

6. **Iterative Refinement**

   - **Set Thresholds for Metrics**: Define minimum acceptable values for support, confidence, and lift to guide rule adjustments.
   - **Monitor Metric Trends**: Keep tracking the metrics over iterations to identify when improvements plateau.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules demonstrate strong predictive abilities where they apply but are limited by low support. By adjusting the rules to increase their applicability without significantly compromising their confidence and lift, we can improve their overall performance. It appears that a local minimum has been reached, and further iterations using the same approach may not yield better results. Therefore, refining the strategy to balance specificity with generality is crucial for the development of effective predictive rules.

---

**Next Steps**

- **Rule Adjustment**: Modify existing rules to include more data points while maintaining high predictive value.
- **Data Analysis**: Re-examine the dataset for overlooked patterns or anomalies that could inform rule refinement.
- **Validation**: Test the adjusted rules on a separate validation set to assess their generalizability.

By implementing these improvements, we aim to enhance the performance of the rules, making them both accurate and broadly applicable for predicting reaction yields.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Evaluation of Effectiveness**

The latest model performance, based on a 5-fold cross-validation, shows an accuracy of **42.86%**. This is a significant decrease compared to previous iterations where validation accuracies were consistently around **76%**, with test accuracies ranging from **62.5%** to **75%**. The decline in accuracy over successive iterations suggests that the current set of rules is not effectively capturing the features necessary to accurately predict the catalytic performance.

**Previous Accuracies for Reference:**

- Validation Accuracies: Consistently around 76%
- Test Accuracies: Ranging from 62.5% to 75%

**Current Iteration Accuracy:**

- Validation Accuracy: **42.86%**

**Interpretation:**

The current rules are not effective enough, as evidenced by the substantial drop in validation accuracy. The model's predictive power has diminished, indicating that the features derived from the current rules are insufficient for accurate classification.

---

**2. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

The consistent decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the model is likely **underfitting**. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data. The reduction in accuracy implies that the current rules do not provide enough information for the model to learn the complex relationships necessary for accurate predictions.

**Interpretation:**

- The model may be too constrained by the current rules, leading to inadequate feature representation.
- The rules might be overly general or not capturing key distinguishing features between modifiers that lead to high or low yields.

---

**3. Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

**Observation of SHAP Analysis:**

In the latest SHAP analysis, only **Rule 6** is reported, with SHAP values for all molecules being **0.0**. This indicates that Rule 6 is not contributing to the model's predictions.

**Discrepancies Identified:**

- **Predicted Low Loading but Experimental High Loading:**
  - For molecules where the model predicts a low loading but the experimental value is high, the rule with the most negative SHAP value should be examined. However, since all SHAP values are zero, no specific rule is identified as problematic.
  
- **Predicted High Loading but Experimental Low Loading:**
  - Similarly, for molecules where the model predicts a high loading but the experimental value is low, there is no rule with a significant positive SHAP value influencing the prediction.

**Interpretation:**

- The absence of significant SHAP values suggests that the current rules are not contributing meaningful information to the model's decisions.
- The model lacks the necessary features to differentiate between high and low yields effectively.

---

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

**Current vs. Previous Accuracy Metrics:**

- Previous validations had accuracies around **76%**, indicating a reasonable model performance.
- The current validation accuracy is **42.86%**, reflecting a substantial decline.

**Probability of Improvement:**

- The decreasing trend in accuracy suggests that the current approach is not improving the model but rather detracting from its predictive capabilities.
- Without modifications, further iterations are unlikely to yield better results.

**Interpretation:**

- The current rules may have reached a local minimum in performance, and continuing with the same set may not enhance the model.
- It is necessary to revisit and revise the rules to break out of this stagnation and improve accuracy.

---

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

**SHAP Analysis indicates:**

- Only Rule 6 is involved, but with zero contribution to the predictions.
- There is a lack of feature importance differentiation among the rules.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**

- **Re-evaluate Rule 6:** Since Rule 6 is not contributing meaningful information, its definition and relevance should be reassessed.
- **Reintroduce or Refine Other Rules:** The absence of other rules in the SHAP analysis suggests they are either not active in the feature matrix or have been omitted. Revisiting previous rules that contributed positively in earlier iterations may help.
- **Enhance Feature Diversity:** Introducing new rules that capture different chemical properties or interactions could provide the model with better discriminatory power.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis, the following steps are recommended to improve the current rules and enhance model performance:

1. **Reassess Rule 6:**

   - **Current Rule 6 Definition:**
     - *Modifiers that contain multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a low yield.*
   - **Issue:**
     - Rule 6 is not contributing to the model's predictions (SHAP value of 0.0).
     - It may be too narrowly defined or not applicable to the dataset.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Refine Rule 6 to capture the impact of ether linkages more effectively.
     - Consider whether the presence of ethers truly correlates with low yield in the dataset.

2. **Review and Reinstate Effective Rules:**

   - **Observation:**
     - Previous iterations included multiple rules contributing to higher accuracies (~76%).
     - Current analysis only involves Rule 6, suggesting other potentially effective rules are inactive.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Reintroduce rules that previously showed positive contributions (e.g., Rules 1-5, 7-10).
     - Evaluate each rule for relevance and adjust definitions to improve their applicability.

3. **Enhance Rule Specificity and Coverage:**

   - **Issue:**
     - The current rules may be too general or too specific, failing to capture critical features.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Adjust rules to balance specificity and coverage.
     - Incorporate substructure patterns or functional group interactions that are more predictive of yield outcomes.

4. **Incorporate Additional Chemical Insights:**

   - **Opportunity:**
     - Utilize domain knowledge to identify new features that influence catalytic performance.
     - Consider electronic effects, steric factors, and molecular geometry.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Develop new rules based on chemical properties not currently represented.
     - For example, include rules regarding the impact of conjugation, hydrogen bonding potential, or molecular size.

5. **Analyze the Dataset for Rule Applicability:**

   - **Issue:**
     - The dataset may contain molecules that do not fit well within the current rule set.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns or clusters within the data.
     - Adjust rules to better align with the actual distribution and characteristics of the molecules.

6. **Avoid Over-reliance on a Single Rule:**

   - **Issue:**
     - Dependence on Rule 6 alone limits the model's ability to make accurate predictions.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Ensure that multiple rules contribute to the feature matrix, providing a richer information set for the model.
     - This also helps prevent overfitting to any single rule or characteristic.

7. **Validate Rule Effectiveness Iteratively:**

   - **Process:**
     - After modifying the rules, re-run the model and assess performance improvements.
     - Use SHAP analysis to determine the contribution of each rule.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Continuously refine and validate rules in an iterative manner.
     - Focus on rules that show significant positive or negative SHAP values, indicating their impact on predictions.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules is not effective enough, as evidenced by the significant decrease in validation accuracy and the lack of meaningful contributions from the rules in the SHAP analysis. To improve the model's performance:

- **Refine and expand the rule set to include more chemically relevant features.**
- **Ensure a balanced representation of rules to avoid underfitting.**
- **Iteratively test and validate rule changes to monitor improvements.**

By adopting a systematic approach to rule refinement and leveraging insights from both the SHAP analysis and chemical domain knowledge, it is possible to enhance the model's predictive accuracy and better understand the factors influencing catalytic performance.

**Summary of Previous Discussions and Recommendations for Optimizing Current Rules**

**Overview**

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction is not performing effectively. The primary issues identified include:

1. **Ineffective Rule Implementation**: The transformation of the language-based rules into SMARTS patterns and then into the numerical feature matrix has been unsuccessful. The feature matrix consists entirely of zeros, indicating that none of the rules are matching any of the modifiers in the SMILES dataset.

2. **Decline in Model Performance**: There has been a significant drop in validation accuracy from approximately 76% in previous iterations to 42.86% in the current iteration. This suggests that the current rules are not capturing the necessary chemical features to accurately predict yield outcomes.

3. **Low Rule Support**: The current rules have lower support compared to previous metrics. This means they apply to a smaller fraction of the dataset, limiting their impact on the model's predictive capabilities.

4. **Overfitting and Underfitting Concerns**: The specificity of the rules may have led to overfitting, where the rules perform well on a small subset of the data but do not generalize well. Conversely, the model may also be underfitting due to rules that are too simplistic or not capturing key distinguishing features.

**Key Issues Identified**

- **Incorrect SMARTS Patterns**: The SMARTS patterns derived from the rules may not accurately match the intended molecular structures due to issues like misused wildcards, incorrect quantifiers, or improper specification of functional group positions.

- **Rules Not Reflecting Dataset**: Some rules (e.g., Rule 10) show zero support, indicating they do not apply to any instances in the dataset. This suggests a misalignment between the rules and the data.

- **Ineffective Feature Representation**: The current rules may not effectively represent the chemical features that influence the reaction yield, as indicated by the zero SHAP values for the rules in the model.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Accurate Matching**

   - **Correct Positioning of Functional Groups**: Modify SMARTS patterns to accurately reflect the positioning of functional groups relative to the carboxylate group. For example:
     - **Rule 1**: Separate patterns for amino groups at alpha and beta positions.
       - *Alpha position*: `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,O-]'`
       - *Beta position*: `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,O-]'`
     - **Rule 3**: Explicit patterns for hydroxyl (–OH) and thiol (–SH) groups near the carboxylate.
     - **Rule 2**: Specify substituents at the para position on aromatic rings using numbering in SMARTS patterns.

   - **Implement Molecular Graph Analysis**: Use RDKit's graph analysis to compute distances between atoms, ensuring accurate identification of groups at specific positions (alpha, beta, gamma).

2. **Expand and Generalize the Rules**

   - **Include All Relevant Rules**: Incorporate all ten rules provided, ensuring each is accurately translated into SMARTS patterns and reflects the underlying chemistry.

   - **Balance Specificity and Coverage**: Adjust the rules to increase their support without significantly compromising confidence and lift. Avoid overly specific patterns that lead to low support or overly general patterns that reduce predictive power.

3. **Enhance Rule Implementation Techniques**

   - **Validate SMARTS Patterns**: For each rule, test the SMARTS patterns against a set of known SMILES strings that should match or not match. This ensures the patterns are correctly identifying the intended structures.

   - **Use Tautomer Enumeration**: Employ RDKit's `TautomerEnumerator` to account for different tautomeric forms that might affect pattern matching.

   - **Improve Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to catch and address issues in parsing SMILES strings or compiling SMARTS patterns, preventing silent failures.

4. **Reassess Ineffective Rules**

   - **Review Rules with Zero Support**: Reevaluate rules like Rule 10 that currently have zero support. Determine if they need to be redefined or removed based on their relevance to the dataset.

   - **Modify Based on Data Analysis**: Analyze the dataset to identify patterns or features not currently captured by the rules. Adjust existing rules or create new ones to encompass these features.

5. **Incorporate Additional Chemical Insights**

   - **Consider Electronic Effects**: Develop rules that account for electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups' influence on the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with the metal center.

   - **Address Steric Factors**: Include rules that consider steric hindrance caused by bulky substituents near coordinating groups, affecting the molecule's ability to interact with the catalyst.

   - **Functional Group Interactions**: Explore how different functional groups might synergistically or antagonistically affect the yield, and reflect this in the rules.

6. **Avoid Overfitting**

   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: Identify and simplify rules that may be too intricate and only apply to a few data points.

   - **Cross-Validation**: Continue using cross-validation to assess the model's generalizability and ensure that improvements in accuracy are not due to overfitting.

7. **Enhance Feature Diversity**

   - **Introduce New Rules**: Based on chemical knowledge, add rules that capture additional relevant features, such as molecules capable of forming specific interactions (hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking) with the catalyst.

   - **Leverage Computational Tools**: Use computational chemistry tools to predict molecular properties (e.g., pKa, logP) that might correlate with yield and incorporate these into the rules.

8. **Continuous Iterative Refinement**

   - **Monitor Performance Metrics**: After each adjustment, evaluate the impact on support, confidence, lift, leverage, and overall model accuracy.

   - **SHAP Analysis for Rule Impact**: Use SHAP analysis to identify which rules contribute most to the model's predictions and adjust accordingly.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is a clear opportunity for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the SMARTS patterns, expanding the rule set, and incorporating additional chemical insights, we can improve the model's ability to accurately predict reaction yields. Ensuring that the rules are both chemically meaningful and data-driven will enhance their applicability and effectiveness.

    ---

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (–NH₂) at the alpha (α) or beta (β) position lead to a **high yield**; when the amino group is at a more distant position (gamma (γ) or beyond), or when bulky groups are present near the amino group, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylate allows for effective bidentate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant amino groups or steric hindrance from bulky substituents reduce coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at α position enhances coordination)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at α position enhances coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group distant and acetamido group adds steric bulk)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate reduces chelation)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)* *(Reduced coordination due to distance)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position lead to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents or interfering groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, while interfering groups may engage in side reactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group withdraws electron density)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde may interfere with coordination)*
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol may engage in side reactions)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional coordinating groups, such as hydroxyl (–OH) or thiol (–SH), located near the carboxylate (α or β positions) lead to a **high yield**; if these groups are distant or absent, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Additional coordinating groups near the carboxylate can form chelate rings with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity and catalytic activity. Distant groups are less effective for coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group at β position enhances chelation)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls enable strong chelation)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(High yield despite lack of additional groups—may act as a baseline)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; if the heterocycle is attached via a linker or substituent, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment allows the lone pair on the nitrogen atom to participate in metal coordination alongside the carboxylate. Linkers increase distance and steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate directly attached to pyridine ring)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Effective coordination via heterocycle)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene reduces coordination)*
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Aromatic ring not directly attached to carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible chains bearing coordinating groups (e.g., phenolic –OH, amino –NH₂) lead to a **high yield**; rigid structures or bulky substituents near the coordinating groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Flexibility allows the molecule to adopt conformations that facilitate effective coordination with the catalyst. Rigid or bulky groups hinder access to coordination sites due to steric effects.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain with phenolic –OH enhances coordination)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Long flexible chain may assist in molecular interactions)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group causes steric hindrance)*
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Rigid aromatic side chain reduces flexibility)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that contain multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and solvation, which may result in the modifier wrapping around metal centers and reducing the availability of active sites. They can also sequester metal ions, decreasing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Polyether chain reduces coordination with catalyst)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple ether linkages hinder effective coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with polyether chains in the dataset)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids or contain highly fluorinated groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density, reducing the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen atoms and weakening their ability to coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple fluorines diminish coordination ability)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)* *(Fluorinated acyl group reduces electron density)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Non-fluorinated analogue shows high yield)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with interfering groups at the para position (e.g., aldehyde (–CHO), thiol (–SH)) lead to a **low yield**; if these groups are in aliphatic chains near the carboxylate, they can lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aromatic systems, these groups may participate in side reactions or hinder coordination due to resonance stabilization. In aliphatic systems, proximity to the carboxylate allows cooperative coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may engage in unwanted reactions)*
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol on aromatic ring may interfere with coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol near carboxylate enhances coordination in aliphatic chain)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group or coordinating functional groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center, reducing coordination and catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group near coordinating amino group)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky benzoyl group hinders coordination)*
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Indole ring may introduce steric hindrance, but still shows high yield possibly due to π-π interactions)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(No bulky groups near carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups lead to a **high yield**; however, the absence of any functional groups capable of enhancing coordination may limit further improvements.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple carboxylic acids can still coordinate with metal centers, but lack of additional coordinating groups means they rely solely on the carboxylate for interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Simple aliphatic acid shows high yield)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **No low-yield examples with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids in the dataset**

These rules elucidate how combinations of substructures and functional groups in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties—such as coordination ability, electron-withdrawing or -donating effects, steric hindrance, and the proximity of functional groups—these rules provide a predictive framework for assessing whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**: Focus on primary functional groups (amino and substituents on aromatic rings) and their positions relative to the carboxyl group.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 9**: Address the effects of molecular flexibility and steric hindrance, which are broadly applicable.
  - **Rule 10**: Highlights the role of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids as effective modifiers.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 3** and **Rule 4**: Discuss specific positioning of coordinating groups and heterocyclic systems.
  - **Rule 6** and **Rule 7**: Consider the impact of polyether chains and fluorination, which affect coordination in nuanced ways.
  - **Rule 8**: Explores how functional groups can have different effects depending on their context within the molecule.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the performance of various molecular modifiers and design new modifiers to optimize the reaction yield. The balance between simple, high-coverage rules and more specific, detailed rules allows for both broad applications and fine-tuning based on molecular structure.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns to accurately reflect functional group positions and connectivity.** Ensure that the SMARTS patterns used in the rules precisely match the intended chemical structures. For example:
  - For **Rule 1**, create separate SMARTS patterns for amino groups at the alpha (α) and beta (β) positions relative to the carboxylate group. Use explicit atom counting or recursive SMARTS to specify positions.
    - *Alpha amino acid pattern*: `[$([NH2]-C-C(=O)[O-])]`
    - *Beta amino acid pattern*: `[$([NH2]-C-C-C(=O)[O-])]`
  - For **Rule 2**, specify substituents at the para position on aromatic rings by correctly numbering ring atoms in the SMARTS pattern.
    - *Para-substituted benzoic acid with electron-withdrawing group*: `c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)[O-]` where an electron-withdrawing group is at the para position.

- **Advice 2**: **Implement molecular graph analysis to determine the relative positions of functional groups.** Use cheminformatics libraries like RDKit to calculate the shortest path between functional groups, ensuring accurate identification of groups at specific positions (α, β, γ) with respect to the carboxylate. This will improve the matching accuracy for rules dependent on positional relationships.

- **Advice 3**: **Validate and test each SMARTS pattern against known SMILES strings.** For every rule, create a test set of SMILES strings that should match (positive examples) and should not match (negative examples). Verify that the SMARTS patterns correctly identify intended structures without false positives or negatives.

- **Advice 4**: **Review and adjust rules with low or zero support to improve their applicability.** For rules like **Rule 10** that currently have zero support, reassess their relevance to the dataset. Modify them to either broaden their scope or remove them if they are not contributing to the model.

- **Advice 5**: **Expand the rule set to include additional relevant chemical features.** Incorporate new rules based on additional chemical insights, such as:
  - **Electronic effects**: Create rules that consider the impact of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the carboxylate's coordination ability.
  - **Steric factors**: Add rules that account for steric hindrance due to bulky groups near coordinating sites.
  - **Functional group interactions**: Include rules for modifiers capable of forming hydrogen bonds or π-π interactions with the catalyst.

- **Advice 6**: **Balance specificity and coverage in rule formulation.** Adjust overly specific rules to increase their support across the dataset without making them too general. Aim for rules that capture essential features influencing yield while applying to a broader range of modifiers.

- **Advice 7**: **Enhance error handling and computational techniques in rule implementation.**
  - Use RDKit's `TautomerEnumerator` to consider different tautomeric forms that might exist in the dataset.
  - Implement robust error handling to catch and address issues during SMILES parsing or SMARTS matching, preventing silent failures.

- **Advice 8**: **Avoid overfitting by simplifying complex rules and ensuring generalizability.** Simplify rules that are too intricate and only match a few data points. Use cross-validation techniques to verify that the model performs well on unseen data and that accuracy improvements are not due to overfitting.

- **Advice 9**: **Utilize computational chemistry tools to predict molecular properties and incorporate them into the rules.** Properties like pKa, logP, and molecular flexibility can correlate with yield. Including these can improve the rules' ability to predict outcomes based on underlying physicochemical properties.

- **Advice 10**: **Continuously monitor and refine the rules based on performance metrics.** After implementing changes, evaluate the impact on support, confidence, lift, and overall model accuracy. Use SHAP analysis to determine each rule's contribution to the model and adjust accordingly for optimal performance.

The **complexity** is appropriate, considering both the type of functional group and its distance from the carboxylate. **Coverage** is robust, supported by multiple data points: high yield (entries 3, 7, and 18) and low yield (entries 29, 31, and 34).

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is **clear**, stating that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to high yield. The **property insight** is acceptable but lacks depth, as it doesn't fully explain why the absence of functional groups is beneficial. The **complexity** is low due to the simplicity of the structures involved. **Coverage** is limited, with only one supporting data point (entry 5). Additional data would enhance the rule's validity.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is **clear** regarding the impact of bulky substituents near the carboxyl group leading to low yield. The **property insight** is good, explaining steric hindrance effects. The **complexity** is moderate, considering steric factors in relation to functional group positioning. **Coverage** includes two low-yield examples (entries 13 and 33) and one high-yield example where bulky groups are distant (entry 7), supporting the rule's validity.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is **clear**, associating perfluorinated modifiers with low yield. The **property insight** is acceptable, highlighting electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine. The **complexity** is low due to the specificity of the functional group involved. **Coverage** is limited to two data points (entries 14 and 28), both yielding low outcomes. The rule could benefit from additional supporting examples.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is **clear**, stating that modifiers with multiple ether linkages lead to low yield. The **property insight** is adequate, discussing how increased flexibility and solvation may hinder catalysis. The **complexity** is low, focusing on a single structural feature. **Coverage** is minimal, with two low-yield data points (entries 11 and 32). More data would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is moderately **clear** but could benefit from more precise language regarding "fused" oxygen-containing heterocycles. The **property insight** is acceptable, noting additional coordination sites. The **complexity** is moderate. **Coverage** is limited, with only one supporting high-yield example (entry 17). The rule lacks sufficient data for strong validation.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is **clear**, identifying that interfering groups at the para position lead to low yield. The **property insight** is sound, explaining potential side reactions and steric hindrance. The **complexity** is appropriate, considering the position and reactivity of functional groups. **Coverage** includes two low-yield data points (entries 10 and 19), supporting the rule.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is **clear** in its explanation of chain length affecting yield. The **property insight** is acceptable, relating flexibility to effective coordination. The **complexity** is moderate. **Coverage** includes one high-yield example (entry 7) and one low-yield example (entry 30), indicating the rule has some support but could benefit from additional data points.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** is **clear**, focusing on amino acids with indole-containing side chains leading to high yield. The **property insight** is acceptable but somewhat limited, mentioning π-π interactions. The **complexity** is low due to specificity. **Coverage** is minimal, with only one high-yield data point (entry 15). More examples are needed to validate the rule.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** is **clear**, noting that N-acylated amino acids or peptides lead to low yield. The **property insight** is adequate, addressing reduced coordination ability. The **complexity** is moderate, involving peptide structures. **Coverage** is limited to one low-yield example (entry 23), requiring more data for confirmation.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** is **clear**, stating that multiple proximal hydroxyl groups lead to high yield. The **property insight** is acceptable, emphasizing enhanced chelation. The **complexity** is moderate. **Coverage** is minimal, with only one high-yield data point (entry 9). Additional supporting data would strengthen the rule.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Combine Rules Related to Proximal Functional Groups**  
  Merge **Rule 3** and **Rule 4** into a single, more general rule that addresses the impact of proximal functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, thiol) on both aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids. This will simplify the ruleset, improve coverage, and reduce redundancy.

  - **Revised Rule**: *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids (aliphatic or aromatic) with functional groups capable of coordination (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol) within two carbons of the carboxylate lead to a **high yield**; if these groups are distant, they lead to a **low yield**.*

- **Advice 2**: **Increase Coverage and Supporting Examples for Rules with Limited Data**
  For **Rules 5**, **7**, **8**, **9**, **12**, **13**, and **14**, provide additional supporting examples from existing data or literature to strengthen their validity. If sufficient data cannot be found, consider merging them into broader rules or reevaluating their inclusion.

- **Advice 3**: **Merge Rules Addressing Steric Hindrance**
  Combine **Rule 6** (bulky substituents near the carboxyl group) and aspects of **Rule 11** (chain length affecting steric hindrance) into a comprehensive rule about steric effects.

  - **Revised Rule**: *Modifiers with bulky substituents or functional groups near the coordination site lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance; if bulky groups are positioned to allow flexibility (e.g., longer chains), they have less impact on yield.*

- **Advice 4**: **Generalize Rules with Specific Functional Groups**
  For rules focusing on specific functional groups with limited examples (e.g., **Rule 12** on indole-containing side chains), broaden the scope to include other aromatic systems capable of similar interactions (π-π stacking, coordination via heteroatoms).

  - **Revised Rule**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) capable of coordinating with metal centers lead to a **high yield**.*

- **Advice 5**: **Consolidate Rules Based on Electron Donating and Withdrawing Effects**
  Combine **Rule 2** (effects of substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids) and aspects of **Rule 7** (effects of fluorination) into a unified rule addressing electronic effects.

  - **Revised Rule**: *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination with metal centers, leading to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups reduce coordination ability, leading to a **low yield**.*

- **Advice 6**: **Clarify and Expand Property Insights**
  For rules where the property insight is acceptable but could be deepened (e.g., **Rule 5**, **Rule 7**), provide more detailed explanations of the underlying chemical principles, such as how the lack of functional groups in aliphatic acids facilitates unhindered coordination.

- **Advice 7**: **Eliminate or Refine Rules with Minimal Support**
  Consider removing or significantly refining **Rules 9** and **14**, which have minimal supporting data. Alternatively, integrate their key concepts into other rules to maintain valuable insights without overcomplicating the ruleset.

- **Advice 8**: **Ensure Rules are Distinct and Non-Redundant**
  Review all rules to remove overlap and redundancy. Ensure each rule addresses a unique aspect of the modifiers' structural or electronic properties that impacts the reaction yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Enhance Rule Examples with SMILES Notations**
  Include SMILES strings for each supporting example to facilitate computational analysis and application of the rules. This will make the rules more practical for cheminformatics applications.

- **Advice 10**: **Prioritize Rules Based on Impact and Applicability**
  Focus on rules with high coverage and strong property insights (e.g., **Revised Rules 1**, **2**, **3**, and **5**) for primary consideration in the modifiers' selection process. This prioritization will streamline decision-making and improve reaction optimization efforts.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (α-amino acids with two carboxyl groups) lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The amino group at the alpha (α) position adjacent to two carboxylic acid groups enhances chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst interaction and stability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid with amino group at α position)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid with amino group at α position)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxy) lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group withdraws electron density)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxy group is electron-donating)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; if the heterocycle is connected via a linker, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic ring can coordinate with metal centers. Direct attachment allows effective coordination, while linkers increase distance and may introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate directly attached to pyridine ring)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Pyrazole ring facilitates coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene linker)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, thiol) within two carbons of the carboxylate lead to a **high yield**; those with these groups at distant positions lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups near the carboxylate can form chelates with metal centers, enhancing coordination. Distant groups are less effective due to decreased interaction and flexibility.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol at β position enhances chelation)*
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group within effective chelation range)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls near carboxylate)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group too distant for effective coordination)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Lack of interfering groups allows the carboxylate to coordinate freely with metal centers, facilitating effective catalyst interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Unsubstituted aliphatic chain enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing bulky substituents near the carboxyl group lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance; if bulky groups are distant, they have less impact on yield.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near the coordination site impede effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center. Distant bulky groups are less obstructive due to increased flexibility.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenyl group near amino and carboxylate reduces coordination)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group causes steric hindrance)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Phenyl group distant from carboxylate minimizes steric effects)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that contain perfluorinated alkyl chains or highly fluorinated groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)* *(Perfluorinated chain reduces coordination)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)* *(Fluorinated acyl group diminishes electron density)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that have multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and solvation, which may result in the modifier wrapping around metal centers, blocking active sites, or sequestering metal ions, thus hindering effective catalysis.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Polyether chain hinders coordination)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple ethers reduce effective coordination)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The heterocyclic oxygen atoms provide additional coordination sites with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction and stability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Heterocyclic oxygen aids in coordination)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing interfering groups (e.g., aldehyde (–CHO), thiol (–SH)) at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Such groups may engage in side reactions or disrupt coordination due to their reactivity or steric effects, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with metal coordination)*
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol group may cause side reactions)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with chain lengths that position functionalized aromatic rings at a distance from the carboxyl group sufficient for flexibility (e.g., five carbons or more) lead to a **high yield**; shorter chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Longer chains allow the aromatic ring's functional groups to interact effectively with the metal center without causing steric hindrance, enhancing coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain with phenolic –OH enhances coordination)*
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(True)* *(Pyridine ring at an optimal distance for coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Shorter chain limits flexibility and coordination)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with indole-containing side chains (e.g., tryptophan derivatives) lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The indole ring can interact with metal centers via π-π interactions and nitrogen coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative with indole ring facilitating coordination)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids or peptides lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: N-acylation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination with metal centers, and peptide bonds may introduce steric hindrance, limiting catalyst interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(N-acylation impedes coordination)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups proximal to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate enhance chelation and interaction with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Hydroxyl groups facilitate coordination)*

---

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate how combinations of substructures and functional groups in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties—such as coordination ability, electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects, steric hindrance, and the proximity of functional groups—we can predict whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1**, **Rule 2**, and **Rule 4**: Focus on primary functional groups and their direct impact on coordination, providing broad applicability.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 7**: Address common structural features that negatively influence yield, such as perfluorination and polyether chains.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 3**, **Rule 9**, and **Rule 12**: Discuss specific structural features, such as heterocyclic systems and indole-containing amino acids.
  - **Rule 6** and **Rule 11**: Explore how chain length and positioning of bulky groups affect the reaction, requiring detailed structural consideration.

By applying these rules, chemists can design and select molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction yield. The balance between simple, high-coverage rules and more specific, detailed rules allows for both broad predictions and fine-tuning based on molecular structure.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Refine Rule 1 SMARTS pattern to accurately capture α-amino dicarboxylic acids**. The current patterns `alpha_amino`, `carboxylic_acid`, and `secondary_carboxylic_acid` may not ensure that both carboxyl groups are present at the correct positions relative to the amino group. Create a comprehensive SMARTS pattern that specifically matches α-amino dicarboxylic acids where the amino group is attached to the α-carbon, which is bonded to two carboxyl groups. For example:

  ```python
  alpha_amino_dicarboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')
  ```

  Replace the existing patterns for Rule 1 with this single pattern in the `patterns` list.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Improve Rule 2 patterns to accurately distinguish between EWGs and EDGs at the para position**. The current `ewg_para` and `edg_para` lists may not comprehensively capture electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups. Additionally, the position specificity (para position) is not enforced. Use SMARTS that specifically target substituents at the para position relative to the carboxyl group on an aromatic ring. For example:

  ```python
  # Electron-withdrawing groups at para position
  ewg_para = [
      Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1[N+](=O)[O-]'),  # Nitro group at para
      Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1CBr')           # Bromomethyl group at para
  ]

  # Electron-donating groups at para position
  edg_para = [
      Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1C'),            # Methyl group at para
      Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1O')             # Hydroxy group at para
  ]
  ```

  Update Rule 2 to use these patterns, ensuring that the substituents are indeed at the para position.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Adjust Rule 3 patterns to distinguish between direct attachment and linker-connected heterocycles**. The current patterns may not differentiate effectively. Modify the `heterocyclic_carboxylic_acid` pattern to:

  ```python
  # Directly attached aromatic heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen
  heterocyclic_carboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[n][cH,c]1cccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')
  ```

  For heterocycles connected via a linker:

  ```python
  # Heterocycle connected via a linker
  heterocycle_via_linker = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c,n]1cccc1[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')
  ```

  Ensure that Rule 3 uses these refined patterns to correctly classify the modifiers.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Expand Rule 4 patterns to include all proximal functional groups within two carbons**. The current patterns may be too limited. Use more general SMARTS patterns:

  ```python
  # Functional groups within two carbons of carboxylate
  proximal_functional_groups = [
      Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4][CX4][N,O,S;H1,H2]'),  # Amino, hydroxy, thiol within 2 carbons
      Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4][N,O,S;H1,H2]')
  ]
  ```

  Similarly, for distant functional groups:

  ```python
  # Functional groups distant from carboxylate (>2 carbons)
  distant_functional_groups = [
      Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4]([CX4])[CX4][N,O,S;H1,H2]')
  ]
  ```

  Update Rule 4 to use these patterns for accurate matching.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Generalize Rule 5 pattern for simple aliphatic carboxylic acids**. The current pattern is specific to octanoic acid. Replace it with a pattern that matches aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups:

  ```python
  # Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups
  simple_aliphatic_carboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2]')  # Four-carbon chain example
  ```

  Adjust the chain length as necessary to include various chain lengths.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Clarify Rule 6 patterns to accurately identify bulky substituents near the carboxyl group**. Refine the `bulky_near_carboxyl` pattern:

  ```python
  # Bulky groups near carboxyl group (e.g., substituted alpha carbon)
  bulky_near_carboxyl = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4]([CX4][#6])[#6]')
  ```

  For distant bulky groups:

  ```python
  # Bulky groups distant from carboxyl group
  bulky_distant = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4][CX4][CX4]([CX4][#6])[#6]')
  ```

  Ensure that these patterns can distinguish between proximity and distance of bulky groups.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Broaden Rule 7 pattern for perfluorinated alkyl chains**. The current pattern may miss some perfluorinated compounds. Use a more general pattern:

  ```python
  # Molecules with perfluorinated alkyl chains
  perfluorinated_chain = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX4](F)(F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)(F)[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')
  ```

  Add variations to capture different chain lengths and branching.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Expand Rule 8 pattern to match multiple ether linkages**. The existing pattern may be too narrow. Use a recursive SMARTS pattern:

  ```python
  # Molecules with multiple ether linkages or polyether chains
  polyether_chain = Chem.MolFromSmarts('([CX4][OX2]){2,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')
  ```

  This pattern matches two or more repeating ether units ending with a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Refine Rule 9 pattern to match fused oxygen-containing heterocycles**. Adjust the `fused_oxygen_heterocycles` pattern:

  ```python
  # Aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles
  fused_oxygen_heterocycles = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1oc2ccccc2c1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')
  ```

  This pattern matches compounds like benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Specify interfering groups at the para position in Rule 10**. Modify the `interfering_groups_para` patterns to enforce para substitution:

  ```python
  # Interfering groups at para position
  interfering_groups_para = [
      Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1C=O'),  # Aldehyde at para position
      Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1[SX2H]')  # Thiol at para position
  ]
  ```

  Ensure these patterns only match when interfering groups are at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Improve chain length specificity in Rule 11 patterns**. Modify the patterns to accurately reflect chain lengths:

  ```python
  # Chain length of five carbons to aromatic ring
  long_chain_functional_aromatic = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4]([CX4])[CX4][CX4][c]')
  # Chain length shorter than five carbons
  short_chain_functional_aromatic = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4][CX4][c]')
  ```

  This ensures correct classification based on chain length to the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Enhance Rule 13 pattern to capture N-acylated amino acids and peptides**. The current pattern may not be sufficient. Use a more inclusive pattern:

  ```python
  # N-acylated amino acids or peptides
  n_acylated_amino_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3][CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')
  ```

  Consider recursive patterns to catch longer peptides if needed.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Adjust Rule 14 pattern to detect multiple proximal hydroxyl groups**. Refine the `multiple_proximal_hydroxyls` pattern:

  ```python
  # Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups near carboxylate
  multiple_proximal_hydroxyls = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])')
  ```

  This pattern matches compounds like pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Review the overall pattern matching logic in the code**. Ensure that for each rule, the code correctly handles cases where exclusions and alternative predictions are needed. It might be beneficial to refactor the code to improve readability and reliability by:

  - Separating the matching logic into functions per rule.
  - Adding comments to explain complex pattern matches.
  - Including unit tests to verify that each rule matches the intended molecules.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**Comparison with Previous Metrics:**

- **Previous Train Confidence:** Ranged from **0.635** to **0.5396**.
- **Previous Train Lift:** Ranged from **1.2048** to **1.0559**.

- **Current Train Confidence:** **0.5071**.
- **Current Train Lift:** **1.0161**.

---

**Observations:**

1. **Decrease in Confidence:**
   - The current train confidence of **0.5071** is lower than the previous average confidence values.
   - A confidence value above **0.5** suggests that when the rule condition is met, there's just over a 50% chance that the prediction is correct.
   - However, this is only marginally better than random chance, indicating that the rules are not strongly predictive.

2. **Lift Approaching 1:**
   - The current train lift of **1.0161** is very close to **1**.
   - Lift values near **1** imply that the rule's condition does not significantly affect the probability of the prediction occurring.
   - In contrast, previous lifts ranged from **1.0559** to **1.2048**, indicating a stronger association in earlier iterations.

3. **Low Support and Negative Leverage:**
   - **Train Support:** The current value is **0.00816**, significantly lower than previous supports (which ranged from **0.0152** to **0.08**).
   - Low support means the rule applies to a very small fraction of the dataset, limiting its practical usefulness.
   - **Train Leverage:** The slightly negative value (**-5.8309e-05**) suggests that the rule's prediction occurs less often than expected if the condition and prediction were independent.
   - Negative leverage, especially when close to zero, indicates a weak or negligible association.

---

**Assessment of Current Rules:**

The current set of rules appears to have decreased in overall performance compared to previous iterations. Specifically:

- **Reduced Predictive Power:** Confidence has decreased, indicating that the rules are less able to correctly predict the outcome when the condition is met.
- **Diminished Association Strength:** Lift values approaching **1** suggest that the conditions specified in the rules do not significantly influence the outcome.
- **Over-Specificity or Over-Complexity:** The low support may indicate that the rules are too specific, applying to too few cases to be effective in practice.

**Potential Reasons for Performance Decline:**

1. **Overfitting to Specific Cases:**
   - The addition of highly specific rules may have tailored the model too closely to particular data points, reducing generalizability.
   - For example, rules that focus on very specific structural motifs or functional groups might not capture broader trends.

2. **Rule Redundancy and Contradictions:**
   - With **14 rules**, some may overlap or contradict others, causing confusion in prediction and reducing overall confidence.
   - Similar or conflicting rules can dilute the strength of each individual rule.

3. **Complexity Leading to Noise:**
   - Complex rules with many conditions might be capturing noise rather than true signal from the data.
   - This can lead to lower confidence and lift as these rules do not generalize well to new data.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Simplify Rules for Higher Generalizability:**
   - **Streamline Rules:**
     - **Merge Similar Rules:** Combine rules that have overlapping conditions or similar outcomes to reduce redundancy.
     - **Remove Overly Specific Rules:** Eliminate rules that apply to very few instances (low support) and have marginal impact on predictions.
   - **Focus on Key Functional Groups:**
     - Prioritize rules that involve functional groups or substructures with strong and clear influence on yield.

2. **Increase Rule Support:**
   - **Broaden Conditions:**
     - Modify rule conditions to cover a wider range of modifiers, thereby increasing support.
     - For instance, instead of specifying exact chain lengths or positions, consider ranges or general proximity.

3. **Enhance Predictive Power:**
   - **Re-Evaluate Rule Conditions:**
     - Analyze which conditions contribute most to high confidence and lift, and focus on refining these.
   - **Incorporate Statistical Analysis:**
     - Use statistical methods (e.g., chi-squared tests) to evaluate the significance of each rule.
     - Retain rules with statistically significant associations.

4. **Reduce Overfitting:**
   - **Cross-Validation:**
     - Validate the rules on different subsets of data to ensure they generalize beyond the training set.
   - **Prune Rules:**
     - Remove rules that perform well on training data but poorly on test data.

5. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - **Assess Impact of Each Rule:**
     - Evaluate the individual contribution of each rule to the overall metrics.
     - Focus on improving rules that have the most significant positive impact.

6. **Consider Reaction Mechanism Insights:**
   - **Integrate Chemical Knowledge:**
     - Use mechanistic understanding of the reaction to inform rule modifications.
     - Prioritize structural features known to influence catalytic activity.

---

**Possible Adjustments to Specific Rules:**

- **Rule 1 and Rule 14 Overlap:**
  - Both deal with amino acids and multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider merging them to increase support.

- **Rule 2 Simplification:**
  - Instead of specifying groups at the para position, generalize to "aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups" to increase coverage.

- **Rule 4 and Rule 11 Similarities:**
  - Both address chain length and proximity of functional groups. Combine these to create a more encompassing rule.

- **Remove Low Impact Rules:**
  - **Rule 5:** Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids may not significantly influence yield as implied.
  - **Rule 13:** N-acylated amino acids may not have enough instances to justify a separate rule.

---

**Determination of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

- **Local Minimum Indication:**
  - The decline in performance metrics suggests that the current iteration may have reached or is nearing a local minimum.
  - Further iterations without significant changes to the approach may not yield better results.

- **Sufficiency of Iterations:**
  - Given that performance is not improving and may be deteriorating, it is reasonable to conclude that enough iterations have been performed under the current strategy.

---

**Next Steps:**

1. **Revise the Rule Generation Approach:**
   - Consider alternative methods for rule induction, such as decision trees or machine learning classifiers, which might reveal different patterns.

2. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - If available, include more data points to enhance statistical power and improve rule robustness.

3. **Collaborate with Domain Experts:**
   - Work with chemists to interpret the results and provide insights that purely statistical analysis might miss.

4. **Evaluate External Validation:**
   - Test the revised rules on external datasets or through experimental validation to assess their practical applicability.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules, while detailed and chemically insightful, does not perform as effectively as desired based on the metrics. The low confidence and lift indicate that the rules are not strong predictors of high or low yield. By simplifying the rules, focusing on key influential factors, and reducing complexity, we can potentially improve their predictive power. It is important to balance chemical intuition with statistical significance to develop rules that are both meaningful and effective.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules Based on Latest Training Results**

**1. Evaluation of Accuracies**

The validation accuracies in previous iterations ranged from **0.76** to **0.77**, with test accuracies between **0.625** and **0.75**. In the latest iteration, the validation accuracy decreased to **0.5429**. This decline suggests that the model's performance is not consistently improving and may indicate issues with the current feature set derived from the rules.

**2. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

The initial high accuracies followed by a decline imply potential **overfitting**. The rules may have been too specifically tailored to the training data, capturing noise rather than underlying patterns. Conversely, the rules might be **underfitting** if they're too simplistic, failing to capture essential features needed for accurate predictions.

**3. Analysis Based on SHAP Values**

**Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

- For molecules like **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**, **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N**, and **C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O**, the predicted loading is low, but the experimental value is high.
- **Rules with High Negative SHAP Values** in these cases are:
  - **Rule 2**: Consistently has negative SHAP values, suggesting it may be undervaluing certain modifiers.
  - **Rule 3** and **Rule 4**: Also contribute negatively, indicating these rules might be too restrictive.

**Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

- For molecules like **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O** and **C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)C(=O)O**, the predicted loading is high, but the experimental value is low.
- **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values** in these cases are:
  - **Rule 1**, **Rule 3**, **Rule 4**, **Rule 9**, **Rule 12**, **Rule 15**: These rules are contributing to overestimations and may need refinement.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

The fluctuation and recent decline in accuracy suggest that the current rules are not generalizing well to new data. The lack of improvement despite multiple iterations indicates that we've reached a **local minimum**, where further adjustments based on the current rules are not enhancing performance.

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

The SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that consistently contribute to incorrect predictions:

- **Rule 2**: With high negative SHAP values in underestimated cases, it may be too harsh on modifiers with electron-donating groups or not accounting for exceptions.
- **Rule 4**: Shows high positive SHAP values in overestimated cases, suggesting that its criteria for proximity of functional groups may be overly broad.
- **Rule 1**, **Rule 3**, **Rule 9**, **Rule 12**, **Rule 15**: Contribute to overestimations, indicating these rules might be adding noise or misrepresenting the impact of certain molecular features.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule 2**:

   - **Issue**: Overly penalizes modifiers with electron-donating groups, leading to underestimation.
   - **Improvement**: Adjust the rule to consider the **overall electron density** and potentially beneficial effects of certain electron-donating groups when they are part of a conjugated system or when steric factors are favorable.

2. **Adjust Rule 4**:

   - **Issue**: May include functional groups that do not significantly enhance loading, causing overestimation.
   - **Improvement**: Specify which functional groups truly enhance chelation (e.g., focus on amines and hydroxyls) and define the effective range more precisely, possibly limiting it to within one carbon atom instead of two.

3. **Re-evaluate Rules with High Positive SHAP Values in Overestimations**:

   - **Rule 1** and **Rule 3**: Examine the conditions under which these rules contribute to misclassification. Introduce exceptions or additional conditions to exclude modifiers that do not conform to the expected behavior.

4. **Incorporate New Features**:

   - **Topological and Electronic Descriptors**: Include features that capture molecular size, shape, and electronic distribution to provide a more nuanced representation.
   - **Descriptors for Steric Hindrance**: Quantify steric effects that might interfere with catalyst interaction.

5. **Enhance Generalization**:

   - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge overlapping rules to reduce complexity and prevent overfitting.
   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: Streamline rules that may be too specific and hindering the model's ability to generalize.

6. **Iterative Testing and Validation**:

   - After refining the rules, re-evaluate the model's performance.
   - Use cross-validation to ensure that improvements are consistent across different data subsets.

7. **Leverage Domain Knowledge**:

   - Consult recent literature to identify new patterns or exceptions that could inform rule adjustments.
   - Engage with subject matter experts to validate the plausibility of rule modifications.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules exhibits limitations in accurately predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts. By focusing on refining rules that contribute to misclassifications—as indicated by the SHAP analysis—we can enhance the model's accuracy. Implementing the recommended adjustments should improve the generalization of the model and provide more reliable predictions in future iterations.

Please let me know if further analysis or specific modifications to the rules are required. Collaboration on refining these rules will be crucial in achieving better predictive performance.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Rule Optimization**

**Overview:**

The current set of rules aimed at predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has shown declining performance in recent iterations. Key metrics such as training confidence, lift, and validation accuracy have decreased. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis indicates that certain rules are contributing to misclassifications, leading to both underestimations and overestimations of modifier loadings. This suggests that the existing rules may be overly complex, overlapping, or not accurately capturing the underlying chemical phenomena.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Decreased Predictive Performance:**
   - **Training Confidence:** Dropped to around 50%, indicating predictions are barely better than random chance.
   - **Lift Values:** Approaching 1, suggesting a weak association between the rules and the predicted outcome.
   - **Low Support and Negative Leverage:** Indicates that the rules apply to a small fraction of the dataset and may not be significantly influencing the predictions.

2. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - **Underestimated Loadings:** Rules like **Rule 2** are contributing negatively, causing underestimations where high loadings are predicted as low.
   - **Overestimated Loadings:** Rules such as **Rule 1**, **Rule 3**, and **Rule 4** are contributing to overestimations, predicting high loadings where experimental values are low.

3. **Potential Overfitting and Complexity:**
   - **Over-Specificity:** Some rules may be too specific, capturing noise rather than meaningful patterns.
   - **Redundancy and Contradictions:** With multiple overlapping rules, there may be conflicting conditions reducing the overall predictive power.

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Refine and Simplify Individual Rules:**

   - **Rule 1 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids):**
     - **Issue:** The SMARTS patterns may not accurately capture α-amino dicarboxylic acids.
     - **Action:** Update the pattern to specifically match molecules where the amino group is adjacent to two carboxyl groups. For example:
       ```python
       alpha_amino_dicarboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')
       ```

   - **Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with EWGs/EDGs at Para Position):**
     - **Issue:** Current patterns may not enforce para substitution and may not comprehensively cover electron-withdrawing/donating groups.
     - **Action:** Use SMARTS patterns that specifically target the para position relative to the carboxyl group:
       ```python
       # Electron-withdrawing groups at para position
       ewg_para = [
           Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1[N+](=O)[O-]'),  # Nitro group at para
           Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1CBr')           # Bromomethyl group at para
       ]
       # Electron-donating groups at para position
       edg_para = [
           Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1C'),            # Methyl group at para
           Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1O')             # Hydroxy group at para
       ]
       ```

   - **Rule 3 (Directly Attached vs. Linker-Connected Heterocycles):**
     - **Issue:** Current patterns may not differentiate effectively between direct attachment and linkage via a chain.
     - **Action:** Adjust patterns to capture the direct attachment:
       ```python
       heterocyclic_carboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[n][cH,c]1cccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')
       heterocycle_via_linker = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c,n]1cccc1[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')
       ```

   - **Rule 4 (Proximal Functional Groups):**
     - **Issue:** Patterns may be too limited and not capture all relevant functional groups within two carbons.
     - **Action:** Use generalized patterns:
       ```python
       proximal_functional_groups = [
           Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4][CX4][N,O,S;H1,H2]'),
           Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4][N,O,S;H1,H2]')
       ]
       distant_functional_groups = [
           Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4]([CX4])[CX4][N,O,S;H1,H2]')
       ]
       ```

2. **Merge and Simplify Overlapping Rules:**

   - **Combine Similar Rules:**
     - **Action:** Merge **Rule 1** and **Rule 14** since both deal with amino acids and multiple hydroxyl groups, increasing support and reducing redundancy.

   - **Eliminate Low-Impact Rules:**
     - **Action:** Remove rules like **Rule 5** and **Rule 13** that have low support and minimal impact on predictions.

3. **Enhance Generalization and Avoid Overfitting:**

   - **Broadening Rule Conditions:**
     - **Action:** Adjust rules to cover a wider range of modifiers by generalizing conditions, thereby increasing their applicability.

   - **Simplifying Complex Rules:**
     - **Action:** Streamline overly specific rules to focus on key influential features, improving the model's ability to generalize.

   - **Cross-Validation and Statistical Testing:**
     - **Action:** Use cross-validation techniques and statistical tests (e.g., chi-squared tests) to ensure that the rules are robust and not overfitting to the training data.

4. **Improve Pattern Matching Logic:**

   - **Refine SMARTS Patterns:**
     - **Action:** Carefully revisit and update SMARTS patterns for each rule to ensure they accurately match the intended molecular features.

   - **Organize Code and Add Documentation:**
     - **Action:** Separate the matching logic into functions per rule, add comments explaining complex pattern matches, and include unit tests for verification.

5. **Leverage Chemical Knowledge:**

   - **Incorporate Mechanistic Insights:**
     - **Action:** Utilize understanding of the reaction mechanism to prioritize structural features that significantly influence yield.

   - **Consult Current Literature and Experts:**
     - **Action:** Engage with chemists and review recent studies to validate the rules and adjust them based on practical experiences and new findings.

**Possibility for Further Optimization without Overfitting**

Yes, there is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the SMARTS patterns, simplifying rules, and ensuring they are based on sound chemical principles, the predictive model can be improved. The key is to strike a balance between specificity and generality—capturing essential patterns that influence the reaction outcome while avoiding excessive complexity that can lead to overfitting.

**Conclusion**

Implementing the suggested improvements should enhance the model's accuracy and generalizability. By focusing on refining the existing rules, simplifying where necessary, and incorporating chemical insights, the predictive performance can be optimized without overfitting.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (α-amino acids with two carboxyl groups) lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The amino group at the alpha (α) position adjacent to two carboxylic acid groups enhances chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst interaction and stability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid with amino group at α position)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid with amino group at α position)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxy) lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group withdraws electron density)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxy group is electron-donating)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; if the heterocycle is connected via a linker, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic ring can coordinate with metal centers. Direct attachment allows effective coordination, while linkers increase distance and may introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate directly attached to pyridine ring)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Pyrazole ring facilitates coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene linker)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, thiol) within two carbons of the carboxylate lead to a **high yield**; those with these groups at distant positions lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups near the carboxylate can form chelates with metal centers, enhancing coordination. Distant groups are less effective due to decreased interaction and flexibility.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol at β position enhances chelation)*
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group within effective chelation range)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls near carboxylate)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group too distant for effective coordination)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Lack of interfering groups allows the carboxylate to coordinate freely with metal centers, facilitating effective catalyst interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Unsubstituted aliphatic chain enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing bulky substituents near the carboxyl group lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance; if bulky groups are distant, they have less impact on yield.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near the coordination site impede effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center. Distant bulky groups are less obstructive due to increased flexibility.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenyl group near amino and carboxylate reduces coordination)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group causes steric hindrance)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Phenyl group distant from carboxylate minimizes steric effects)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that contain perfluorinated alkyl chains or highly fluorinated groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)* *(Perfluorinated chain reduces coordination)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)* *(Fluorinated acyl group diminishes electron density)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that have multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a **low yield**.**

These rules illustrate how combinations of substructures and functional groups in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties—such as coordination ability, electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects, steric hindrance, and the proximity of functional groups—we can predict whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1**, **Rule 2**, and **Rule 4**: Focus on primary functional groups and their direct impact on coordination, providing broad applicability.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 7**: Address common structural features that negatively influence yield, such as perfluorination and polyether chains.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 3**, **Rule 9**, and **Rule 12**: Discuss specific structural features, such as heterocyclic systems and indole-containing amino acids.
  - **Rule 6** and **Rule 11**: Explore how chain length and positioning of bulky groups affect the reaction, requiring detailed structural consideration.

By applying these rules, chemists can design and select molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction yield. The balance between simple, high-coverage rules and more specific, detailed rules allows for both broad predictions and fine-tuning based on molecular structure.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine and Update SMARTS Patterns for Accurate Matching**

  - **Action**: Review and update the SMARTS patterns used in the rules to ensure they accurately capture the intended molecular features. Focus on correcting patterns that may be too broad or too narrow, leading to misclassifications.
    - **For Rule 1 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids)**:
      - Update the SMARTS pattern to specifically match α-amino dicarboxylic acids where the amino group is adjacent to two carboxyl groups.
      - **Updated Pattern**:
        ```python
        alpha_amino_dicarboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')
        ```
    - **For Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para Substituents)**:
      - Ensure the SMARTS patterns specifically target substituents at the para position relative to the carboxyl group and accurately differentiate between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups.
      - **Updated Patterns**:
        ```python
        # Electron-withdrawing group at para position
        ewg_para = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc(ccc1C(=O)[O-])[N+](=O)[O-]')
        # Electron-donating group at para position
        edg_para = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc(ccc1C(=O)[O-])C')  # Methyl group
        edg_para_hydroxy = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc(ccc1C(=O)[O-])O')  # Hydroxy group
        ```
    - **For Rule 3 (Directly Attached Heterocycles vs. Linker-Connected)**:
      - Modify patterns to distinguish between heterocycles directly attached to carboxyl groups and those connected via linkers.
      - **Updated Patterns**:
        ```python
        # Directly attached heterocyclic carboxylic acid
        direct_heterocycle = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[nH1]1cccc1C(=O)[O-]')
        # Heterocycle connected via linker
        linked_heterocycle = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[n,c]1cccc1[CX4][CX3](=O)[O-]')
        ```
    - **For Rule 4 (Proximal Functional Groups within Two Carbons)**:
      - Create generalized patterns to capture functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, thiol) within two carbons of the carboxylate.
      - **Updated Patterns**:
        ```python
        # Functional groups within two carbons of carboxylate
        proximal_functional_groups = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4][CX4][N,O,S]')
        # Functional groups distant from carboxylate
        distant_functional_groups = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4]~[CX4]~[CX4][N,O,S]')
        ```

- **Advice 2**: **Simplify and Merge Overlapping or Redundant Rules**

  - **Action**: Identify rules that overlap in scope or target similar structural features and merge them to reduce redundancy and complexity.
    - Combine **Rule 1** and **Rule 14** since both involve amino acids with multiple functional groups proximal to the carboxylate, enhancing chelation.
    - Eliminate low-impact rules with minimal support or significance, such as **Rule 5** (simple aliphatic carboxylic acids) and **Rule 13** (N-acylated amino acids or peptides), especially if they contribute to misclassifications.
    - **Resulting Simplification**:
      - **New Rule**: "Modifiers that are amino acids with additional functional groups (amino, hydroxyl) proximal to the carboxylate lead to a **high yield**."

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance Generalization of Rules to Increase Coverage**

  - **Action**: Broaden the conditions within rules to cover a wider range of modifiers while maintaining specificity to influential features.
    - In **Rule 2**, generalize electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups to include a wider variety of substituents based on their electronic effects.
    - In **Rule 4**, expand the definition of proximal functional groups to include other coordinating atoms like phosphates if relevant.
    - **Example Generalization**:
      - Modify **Rule 2** to: "Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) lead to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., alkyl, alkoxy) lead to a **low yield**."

- **Advice 4**: **Avoid Overfitting by Simplifying Complex Rules**

  - **Action**: Streamline rules that are overly specific or have complex conditions that may only apply to a few examples.
    - Reevaluate rules like **Rule 6** (bulky substituents near the carboxyl group) and **Rule 11** (chain length affecting flexibility) to focus on the key factors affecting yield.
    - Simplify **Rule 6** to emphasize steric hindrance near the coordination site without specifying the exact nature of the bulky group.
    - **Simplified Rule**:
      - "Modifiers with bulky groups adjacent to the carboxylate lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance affecting metal coordination."

- **Advice 5**: **Improve Pattern Matching Logic and Code Organization**

  - **Action**: Refine the code implementing the rules to ensure accurate matching and maintainability.
    - Separate the SMARTS patterns and matching logic for each rule into individual functions or classes.
    - Add descriptive comments and documentation for complex patterns to facilitate understanding and future updates.
    - Include unit tests for each rule to verify that the patterns correctly identify the intended structures.
    - **Implementation Steps**:
      - For each rule, create a function `def match_rule_X(molecule):` that returns `True` if the molecule matches the rule's criteria.
      - Document each function with a docstring explaining the rule and its SMARTS pattern.
      - Write test cases using molecules from the dataset to ensure each function behaves as expected.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Mechanistic Understanding into Rule Development**

  - **Action**: Use knowledge of the reaction mechanism to focus on structural features that are most likely to influence the yield.
    - Consider the role of metal coordination, electron density, and steric effects in catalyst performance.
    - Adjust rules to prioritize modifiers that enhance metal-ligand interactions critical for the reaction.
    - **Example Incorporation**:
      - Emphasize modifiers that can act as bidentate ligands, increasing catalyst stability and reactivity.
      - Adjust rules to capture modifiers capable of forming stable chelate rings with the metal center.

- **Advice 7**: **Validate and Test Rules Using Statistical Methods**

  - **Action**: Use cross-validation and statistical tests to ensure that the rules are robust and not overfitting to the training data.
    - Perform k-fold cross-validation to assess how well the rules generalize to unseen data.
    - Use statistical significance tests, such as chi-squared tests, to evaluate the association between rule application and reaction yield.
    - Adjust rules based on validation results, focusing on those that consistently contribute to accurate predictions.

- **Advice 8**: **Consult Current Literature and Domain Experts**

  - **Action**: Review recent research publications and consult with chemists experienced in this reaction type to validate and enhance the rules.
    - Incorporate findings from the latest studies on similar catalytic systems to refine the rules.
    - Seek expert opinions on the plausibility of the rules and their alignment with chemical intuition.
    - **Implementation**:
      - Update rules to reflect new insights into modifier effects on catalyst performance.
      - Modify or discard rules that lack support from experimental evidence or mechanistic rationale.

It provides adequate property insight into how these structures might hinder coordination. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific structural features. Coverage is sufficient with multiple data points supporting low yield, and the rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: The rule clearly distinguishes the impact of bulky substituents near the carboxyl group versus those that are distant. It offers logical property insight into steric hindrance effects on coordination. The complexity is appropriate, considering the position of bulky groups. Coverage is acceptable with supporting data points for both high and low yields, achieving a balanced approach.

- **Comment 9**: This rule is clear in identifying N-acylated amino acids or peptides leading to low yield. It provides adequate property insight into how N-acylation affects coordination. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific modifications of amino acids. Coverage is sufficient with multiple data points supporting low yield, ensuring the rule is effective and well-balanced.

- **Comment 10**: The rule clearly specifies modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles. It offers adequate property insight into additional coordination sites provided by heterocyclic oxygen atoms. The complexity is higher due to specific structural requirements. Coverage is minimal but acceptable with two supporting data points for high yield, balancing complexity with coverage.

- **Comment 11**: The rule is detailed but clear, defining modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected via flexible aliphatic linkers of specific lengths. It provides good property insight into the importance of linker length for effective interaction. The complexity is appropriate, combining linker length and aromatic systems. Coverage is sufficient with data points supporting both high and low yields, achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 12**: This rule is clear in distinguishing between aliphatic thiols proximal to the carboxyl group and aromatic thiols. It provides adequate property insight into how proximity and aromaticity affect coordination. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on functional group type and position. Coverage is minimal but acceptable with data points supporting both high and low yields, maintaining balance.

- **Comment 13**: While the rule is clear in stating that modifiers containing aldehyde groups lead to a low yield, it lacks sufficient coverage with only one supporting data point. Despite logical property insight, the limited data support affects the rule's overall effectiveness.

- **Comment 14**: The rule clearly identifies modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups proximal to the carboxyl group leading to a high yield. It provides reasonable property insight into enhanced chelation due to additional hydroxyl groups. However, coverage is insufficient with only one supporting data point, limiting the rule's strength despite appropriate complexity.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of both an amino group at the α-position and two carboxyl groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions, enhancing coordination with the catalyst's metal center and improving reaction efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxy) lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, reducing catalytic performance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Para-nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group withdraws electron density)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxy group is electron-donating)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups within two carbons of the carboxylate lead to a **high yield**; those with these groups more than four carbons away lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups proximal to the carboxylate enhance chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst interaction. Distant groups are less effective due to decreased coordination capability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group two carbons away from carboxylate)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group adjacent to carboxylate)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group distant from carboxylate)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; if the heterocycle is connected via a linker, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic ring can coordinate with metal centers. Direct attachment allows effective coordination, while linkers increase distance and may introduce steric hindrance, reducing interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate directly attached to pyridine ring)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Pyrazole ring facilitates coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene linker)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains or highly fluorinated groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)* *(Perfluorinated chain reduces coordination)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)* *(Fluorinated acyl group diminishes electron density)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple carboxylic acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers without steric hindrance or electronic interference from other groups, facilitating efficient catalysis.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Unsubstituted aliphatic chain enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and solvation, potentially causing the modifier to sequester metal ions or block active sites, hindering effective catalysis.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Polyether chain hinders coordination)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple ethers reduce effective coordination)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group (e.g., aromatic rings) lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance; if bulky groups are distant, they have less impact on yield.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near the coordination site impede effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center. Distant bulky groups allow for flexibility and better coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenyl group near amino and carboxylate reduces coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Phenyl ring distant from carboxylate minimizes steric effects)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids or peptides lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: N-acylation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination with metal centers, and peptide bonds may introduce steric hindrance, limiting catalyst interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(N-acylation impedes coordination)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Acetamido group hinders coordination)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The heterocyclic oxygen atoms provide additional coordination sites with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction and stability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Heterocyclic oxygen aids in coordination)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Lactam oxygen enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected via flexible aliphatic linkers (four or more carbons) to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; shorter linkers lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Longer linkers allow the aromatic group's functional sites to interact effectively with the metal center without causing steric hindrance, enhancing coordination and catalyst activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain allows effective interaction)*
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(True)* *(Pyridine ring at optimal distance)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Shorter chain limits flexibility and coordination)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups lead to a **high yield** when the thiol is proximal to the carboxyl group; aromatic thiols lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols near the carboxyl group can strongly coordinate with metal centers. Aromatic thiols may engage in side reactions or cause steric hindrance due to rigidity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group adjacent to carboxylate enhances coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aromatic thiol may cause side reactions)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (–CHO) groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may participate in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups proximal to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate enhance chelation and interaction with metal centers, improving catalyst performance through additional coordination sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls facilitate coordination)*

These rules capture the relationship between molecular modifiers' substructures and their impact on the reaction yield. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the modifiers, the rules provide predictive power grounded in chemical principles. The balance between broad coverage and specificity ensures practical applicability across a range of modifiers.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1**, **Rule 2**, **Rule 3**, and **Rule 6** address fundamental structural features affecting coordination, offering broad applicability.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 7** highlight common motifs that negatively influence yield, such as perfluorination and polyether chains.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 4**, **Rule 10**, and **Rule 11** focus on specific structural arrangements, like heterocycles and linker lengths, requiring detailed structural considerations.
  - **Rule 8** and **Rule 12** delve into steric and positional effects of bulky groups and thiols on coordination.

By applying these rules, chemists can rationally design and select molecular modifiers to optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The integration of chemical insights into functional group behavior and coordination chemistry enhances the predictive capability of the rules.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: *Correct the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1.* The current pattern `'N[C@@H](C(=O)O)C(=O)O'` incorrectly specifies both carboxyl groups attached to the α-carbon, which doesn't represent α-amino dicarboxylic acids like aspartic and glutamic acid. Instead, modify the SMARTS pattern to match α-amino acids with a side-chain carboxyl group. A more general pattern would be `'N[C@@H](C(=O)O)CC(=O)O'` for aspartic acid and `'N[C@@H](C(=O)O)CCC(=O)O'` for glutamic acid. To encompass both, use a pattern like `'N[C@@H](C(=O)O)C[CX3](=O)O'` or `'N[C@@H](C(=O)O)[CX4][CX3](=O)O'`, which allows for a carboxyl group attached via a side chain.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: *Refine the SMARTS patterns for Rule 2 to accurately capture electron-withdrawing (EWG) and electron-donating groups (EDG) at the para position.* The current code only includes nitro, bromine, and chlorine as EWGs and hydroxy and methyl as EDGs. Expand the EWG patterns to include other groups like cyano (`'c1ccc(cc1)[C]#N'`), trifluoromethyl (`'c1ccc(cc1)C(F)(F)F'`), and the EDG patterns to include methoxy (`'c1ccc(OC)cc1'`), amino (`'c1ccc(N)cc1'`). Ensure the substituents are specifically at the para position relative to the carboxyl group by enforcing positional specificity in the SMARTS patterns.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: *Revise the SMARTS patterns for Rule 3 to accurately detect amino or hydroxyl groups within two carbons of the carboxylate.* The current patterns may not correctly match all relevant structures. Use patterns like `'[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX4][C](=O)O'` and `'[OX2H][CX4][CX4][C](=O)O'` for proximal functional groups. For groups more than four carbons away, use patterns like `'[C][C][C][C][CX4;!$(C(=O)O)]~[NX3;H2,H1]'` and `'[C][C][C][C][CX4;!$(C(=O)O)]~[OX2H]'`. This ensures the functional groups' positions are accurately reflected.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: *Adjust the exclusion criteria in Rule 6 to prevent unintentionally excluding simple aliphatic carboxylic acids.* Currently, the exclusion patterns `[Chem.MolFromSmarts('[#7]'), Chem.MolFromSmarts('[#8]'), Chem.MolFromSmarts('[#16]')]` may exclude all molecules containing nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur, including the carboxyl group itself. Modify the exclusion patterns to target additional functional groups attached to the aliphatic chain, excluding the carboxylate oxygen. For example, use `'[C;!$(C(=O)O)]~[N,O,S]'` to exclude molecules where nitrogen, oxygen (other than the carboxylate), or sulfur are attached to the carbon chain.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: *For Rule 8, clarify and differentiate between bulky substituents near and distant from the carboxyl group.* Modify the patterns to accurately capture steric effects. For bulky groups near the carboxyl group, use a pattern like `'[C](=O)O[C;R1][C;R1]'` to detect adjacent bulky substituents. For bulky groups distant from the carboxyl group, use patterns that specify longer carbon chains before the bulky group, such as `'[C](=O)O[CX4][CX4][CX4][C;R1]'` to indicate the bulky group is further away.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: *Enhance the SMARTS pattern for Rule 11 to correctly identify electron-rich aromatics connected via flexible linkers.* Ensure the pattern distinguishes between short and long linkers accurately. Use a pattern like `'c[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][C](=O)O'` for long linkers (four or more carbons) and `'c[CX4][CX4][C](=O)O'` for short linkers (less than four carbons). Also, clearly define what constitutes an electron-rich aromatic system and adjust the SMARTS accordingly.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: *For Rule 12, refine the SMARTS patterns to correctly identify thiol groups proximal to the carboxyl group and distinguish aromatic thiols.* Use `'[SX2H][CX4][C](=O)O'` for aliphatic thiols near the carboxyl group and `'c[SH]'` for aromatic thiols. Ensure that the patterns accurately reflect the proximity of the thiol group to the carboxylate.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: *Incorporate thorough testing of the SMARTS patterns with a diverse set of molecules to validate accuracy.* Use the supporting examples provided for each rule and additional test cases to ensure that the SMARTS patterns match the intended molecules and exclude non-relevant ones. This step can help identify and correct mismatches between the rules and the code.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: *Add detailed comments and documentation in the code for clarity.* Explain the purpose and structure of each SMARTS pattern, any limitations or approximations, and how they relate to the natural language rules. This will aid in future code reviews and modifications.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: *Consider using recursive SMARTS patterns or defining atom maps for complex rules.* For rules that involve specific positions or orientations (e.g., para-substituted aromatics in Rule 2), recursive SMARTS or atom mapping can provide more precise matches. For example, use `'[cH:c1][cH:c2][c:c3][c:c4][cH:c5][cH:c6][c1][c2][c3][c4][c5][c6][C](=O)O'` to define specific positions on the aromatic ring relative to the carboxyl group.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of both an amino group at the α-position and two carboxyl groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions, enhancing coordination with the catalyst's metal center and improving reaction efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxy) lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, reducing catalytic performance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Para-nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group withdraws electron density)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxy group is electron-donating)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups within two carbons of the carboxylate lead to a **high yield**; those with these groups more than four carbons away lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups proximal to the carboxylate enhance chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst interaction. Distant groups are less effective due to decreased coordination capability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group two carbons away from carboxylate)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group adjacent to carboxylate)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group distant from carboxylate)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; if the heterocycle is connected via a linker, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic ring can coordinate with metal centers. Direct attachment allows effective coordination, while linkers increase distance and may introduce steric hindrance, reducing interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate directly attached to pyridine ring)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Pyrazole ring facilitates coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene linker)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains or highly fluorinated groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)* *(Perfluorinated chain reduces coordination)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)* *(Fluorinated acyl group diminishes electron density)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple carboxylic acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers without steric hindrance or electronic interference from other groups, facilitating efficient catalysis.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Unsubstituted aliphatic chain enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and solvation, potentially causing the modifier to sequester metal ions or block active sites, hindering effective catalysis.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Polyether chain hinders coordination)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple ethers reduce effective coordination)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group (e.g., aromatic rings) lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance; if bulky groups are distant, they have less impact on yield.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near the coordination site impede effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center. Distant bulky groups allow for flexibility and better coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenyl group near amino and carboxylate reduces coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Phenyl ring distant from carboxylate minimizes steric effects)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids or peptides lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: N-acylation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination with metal centers, and peptide bonds may introduce steric hindrance, limiting catalyst interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(N-acylation impedes coordination)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Acetamido group hinders coordination)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The heterocyclic oxygen atoms provide additional coordination sites with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction and stability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Heterocyclic oxygen aids in coordination)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Lactam oxygen enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected via flexible aliphatic linkers (four or more carbons) to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; shorter linkers lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Longer linkers allow the aromatic group's functional sites to interact effectively with the metal center without causing steric hindrance, enhancing coordination and catalyst activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain allows effective interaction)*
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(True)* *(Pyridine ring at optimal distance)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Shorter chain limits flexibility and coordination)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups lead to a **high yield** when the thiol is proximal to the carboxyl group; aromatic thiols lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols near the carboxyl group can strongly coordinate with metal centers. Aromatic thiols may engage in side reactions or cause steric hindrance due to rigidity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group adjacent to carboxylate enhances coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aromatic thiol may cause side reactions)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (–CHO) groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may participate in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups proximal to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate enhance chelation and interaction with metal centers, improving catalyst performance through additional coordination sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls facilitate coordination)*

These rules capture the relationship between molecular modifiers' substructures and their impact on the reaction yield. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the modifiers, the rules provide predictive power grounded in chemical principles. The balance between broad coverage and specificity ensures practical applicability across a range of modifiers.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1**, **Rule 2**, **Rule 3**, and **Rule 6** address fundamental structural features affecting coordination, offering broad applicability.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 7** highlight common motifs that negatively influence yield, such as perfluorination and polyether chains.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 4**, **Rule 10**, and **Rule 11** focus on specific structural arrangements, like heterocycles and linker lengths, requiring detailed structural considerations.
  - **Rule 8** and **Rule 12** delve into steric and positional effects of bulky groups and thiols on coordination.

By applying these rules, chemists can rationally design and select molecular modifiers to optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The integration of chemical insights into functional group behavior and coordination chemistry enhances the predictive capability of the rules.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **For Rule 1**, the SMARTS pattern `'N[C@@H](C(=O)O)C[CX3](=O)O'` used in the code is too specific due to the inclusion of stereochemistry (`@@H`) and may miss valid α-amino dicarboxylic acids. Remove stereochemistry constraints and generalize the pattern to match any α-amino dicarboxylic acid. A revised pattern could be `'N[C][C](=O)O'` where the side chain contains another carboxyl group, like `'N[C][C](=O)O'` with a wildcard for the side chain containing a carboxylic acid group: `'N[C][CX4][CX3](=O)O'`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **For Rule 2**, the code uses hardcoded SMARTS patterns for specific electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups at the para position, which may not cover all relevant substituents. Instead, use more general patterns to represent EWGs and EDGs. For example, use `'c1ccc([C](=O)O)cc1[!#6;!H0]'` for EWGs (non-carbon atoms at the para position) and `'c1ccc([C](=O)O)cc1[C&H3]'` for EDGs (alkyl groups at the para position). Ensure positional specificity by anchoring the substituent to the para position relative to the carboxyl group.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **For Rule 3**, the SMARTS patterns may not accurately differentiate between functional groups within two carbons and those more than four carbons away from the carboxylate. Update the patterns to reflect the exact carbon counts. For amino groups within two carbons: `'[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0,H1]'` and beyond four carbons: `'[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][NX3;H2,H1]'`. Ensure that the patterns correctly match the distance from the functional group to the carboxylate.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **For Rule 4**, the pattern `'[n][c,C](=O)O'` may not accurately match aromatic heterocycles with nitrogen atoms directly attached to the carboxyl group. Modify the pattern to ensure the nitrogen is part of the ring and directly bonded to the carboxyl group: `'[nH0;r5,r6][c;r5,r6](=O)[O;H1]'`. For heterocycles connected via a linker, adjust the pattern to include an intervening linker atom: `'[nH0;r5,r6][CX4][c;r5,r6](=O)[O;H1]'`.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **For Rule 5**, the pattern `'C(F)(F)(F)'` matches only trifluoromethyl groups, missing longer perfluorinated alkyl chains. Update the pattern to detect perfluoroalkyl chains of any length: `'[CX4](F)(F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)F'` or use recursion to match perfluorinated chains: `'[CX4](F)(F)(F)(F)*'`.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **For Rule 6**, ensure that the exclusion of additional functional groups is correctly implemented. The current exclusion pattern might not catch all functionalities. Refine the exclusion pattern to `'[CX4;!$(C(=O)O);!$(C[*]=O);!$(C[*][N,O,S])]~[C](=O)O'`, which excludes carbons bonded to heteroatoms or multiple bonds, ensuring only simple aliphatic chains are matched.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **For Rule 7**, the pattern `'([#6][OX2;R0]){2,}'` might not match polyether chains effectively. Use a recursive pattern to match multiple ether linkages: `'$([CX4;$([CX4][OX2][CX4])][OX2][CX4])'` to match chains with two or more consecutive ether bonds.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **For Rule 8**, the patterns may not accurately capture bulky substituents near the carboxyl group. Adjust the pattern for bulky groups near the carboxylate to include large substituents like phenyl rings: `'[C](=O)O[CX4][C](c1ccccc1)'`. For distant bulky groups, ensure the pattern reflects increased chain length: `'[C](=O)O[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][C](c1ccccc1)'`.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **For Rule 9**, the pattern `'C(=O)N[C;!H0]'` may incorrectly match any amide bond. Refine it to specifically match N-acylated amino acids or peptides: `'C(=O)N[CX4][C](=O)O'` to represent a peptide bond adjacent to a carboxyl group.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **For Rule 10**, the pattern `'c1occc1C(=O)O'` is too specific and only matches one type of fused heterocycle. Generalize the pattern to match aromatic rings fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles attached to a carboxyl group: `'c1occc1[c,C](=O)O'` or use a more generic pattern for oxygen heterocycles fused to aromatic systems.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: **For Rule 11**, improve the differentiation between short and long aliphatic linkers. For long linkers (four or more carbons), use `'c[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][C](=O)O'`, and for short linkers (less than four carbons), use `'c[CX4][CX4][C](=O)O'`. Ensure that the electron-rich aromatic system is correctly identified, possibly using a pattern like `'c[O,N,S]'`.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: **For Rule 12**, confirm that the code distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic thiols proximal to the carboxyl group. For aliphatic thiols near the carboxyl group, use `'[SX2H][CX4][C](=O)O'`. For aromatic thiols, use `'c[SX2H]'`, ensuring they lead to a low yield as per the rule.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: **For Rule 13**, the aldehyde pattern `'[CX3H1](=O)'` may match aldehyde groups anywhere in the molecule. Modify the pattern to match aldehydes attached to an aromatic ring or near the carboxyl group if relevant: `'c[CX3H1](=O)'` or context-specific patterns to avoid false positives.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: **For Rule 14**, the code checks for multiple matches of the pattern `'[OX2H][CX4][C](=O)O'` but may not capture molecules with multiple proximal hydroxyl groups accurately. Adjust the pattern to detect vicinal diols near the carboxyl group: `'[OX2H][CX4][OX2H][CX4][C](=O)O'` or use counts of hydroxyl groups within a specified distance from the carboxylate.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of both an amino group at the α-position and two carboxyl groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions, enhancing coordination with the catalyst's metal center and improving reaction efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxy) lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, reducing catalytic performance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Para-nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group withdraws electron density)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxy group is electron-donating)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups within two carbons of the carboxylate lead to a **high yield**; those with these groups more than four carbons away lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups proximal to the carboxylate enhance chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst interaction. Distant groups are less effective due to decreased coordination capability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group two carbons away from carboxylate)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group adjacent to carboxylate)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group distant from carboxylate)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; if the heterocycle is connected via a linker, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic ring can coordinate with metal centers. Direct attachment allows effective coordination, while linkers increase distance and may introduce steric hindrance, reducing interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate directly attached to pyridine ring)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Pyrazole ring facilitates coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene linker)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains or highly fluorinated groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)* *(Perfluorinated chain reduces coordination)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)* *(Fluorinated acyl group diminishes electron density)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple carboxylic acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers without steric hindrance or electronic interference from other groups, facilitating efficient catalysis.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Unsubstituted aliphatic chain enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and solvation, potentially causing the modifier to sequester metal ions or block active sites, hindering effective catalysis.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Polyether chain hinders coordination)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple ethers reduce effective coordination)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group (e.g., aromatic rings) lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance; if bulky groups are distant, they have less impact on yield.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near the coordination site impede effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center. Distant bulky groups allow for flexibility and better coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenyl group near amino and carboxylate reduces coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Phenyl ring distant from carboxylate minimizes steric effects)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids or peptides lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: N-acylation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination with metal centers, and peptide bonds may introduce steric hindrance, limiting catalyst interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(N-acylation impedes coordination)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Acetamido group hinders coordination)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The heterocyclic oxygen atoms provide additional coordination sites with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction and stability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Heterocyclic oxygen aids in coordination)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Lactam oxygen enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected via flexible aliphatic linkers (four or more carbons) to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; shorter linkers lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Longer linkers allow the aromatic group's functional sites to interact effectively with the metal center without causing steric hindrance, enhancing coordination and catalyst activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain allows effective interaction)*
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(True)* *(Pyridine ring at optimal distance)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Shorter chain limits flexibility and coordination)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups lead to a **high yield** when the thiol is proximal to the carboxyl group; aromatic thiols lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols near the carboxyl group can strongly coordinate with metal centers. Aromatic thiols may engage in side reactions or cause steric hindrance due to rigidity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group adjacent to carboxylate enhances coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aromatic thiol may cause side reactions)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (–CHO) groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may participate in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups proximal to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate enhance chelation and interaction with metal centers, improving catalyst performance through additional coordination sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls facilitate coordination)*

These rules capture the relationship between molecular modifiers' substructures and their impact on the reaction yield. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the modifiers, the rules provide predictive power grounded in chemical principles. The balance between broad coverage and specificity ensures practical applicability across a range of modifiers.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1**, **Rule 2**, **Rule 3**, and **Rule 6** address fundamental structural features affecting coordination, offering broad applicability.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 7** highlight common motifs that negatively influence yield, such as perfluorination and polyether chains.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 4**, **Rule 10**, and **Rule 11** focus on specific structural arrangements, like heterocycles and linker lengths, requiring detailed structural considerations.
  - **Rule 8** and **Rule 12** delve into steric and positional effects of bulky groups and thiols on coordination.

By applying these rules, chemists can rationally design and select molecular modifiers to optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The integration of chemical insights into functional group behavior and coordination chemistry enhances the predictive capability of the rules.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 2** - The SMARTS patterns for detecting electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position need refinement. The current patterns may misclassify substituents. Specifically:
  - **Define specific EWGs and EDGs**: Create SMARTS patterns for common EWGs (e.g., nitro `[N+](=O)[O-]`, cyano `C#N`, halogens `[F,Cl,Br,I]`) and EDGs (e.g., methyl `[CH3]`, methoxy `[OCH3]`, amino `[NH2]`, hydroxy `[OH]`).
  - **Ensure positional specificity**: Use SMARTS that precisely match substituents at the para position relative to the carboxyl group, possibly by using ring atom indices or recursive SMARTS. For example, for para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid, use `c1ccc([C](=O)[O;H1,-])cc1[EWG]` and `c1ccc([C](=O)[O;H1,-])cc1[EDG]`.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Rule 2 Code Modification** - Update the code to use the refined SMARTS patterns for EWGs and EDGs. Implement logic to assign `+1` when an EWG is present at the para position and `-1` when an EDG is present. Ensure that molecules with no substituent or substituents at other positions are assigned `0`.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Rule 3** - Improve the SMARTS patterns to accurately detect amino or hydroxyl groups within two carbons of the carboxylate and distinguish them from those beyond four carbons. Use atom counting in SMARTS to specify the exact distance:
  - For proximal groups: `[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-][CX4][CX4][NX3;H2,H1]` or `[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-][CX4][NX3;H2,H1]`.
  - For distant groups: `[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-][CX4]~[CX4]~[CX4]~[CX4][NX3;H2,H1]`.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Rule 4** - Modify the SMARTS to ensure the nitrogen atom is part of the aromatic heterocycle directly attached to the carboxyl group. Use patterns like `[n][c](=O)[O;H1,-]` where `[n]` is a nitrogen atom in the ring bonded directly to the carbonyl carbon.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Rule 5** - Generalize the SMARTS for perfluorinated alkyl chains to detect chains of any length. Use a recursive pattern like `[CX4](F)(F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)[CX4,F]*`, which matches three or more fully fluorinated carbons.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Rule 6** - Refine the exclusion of additional functional groups by using a pattern that ensures only carbons and hydrogens are present in the aliphatic chain. Exclude molecules with heteroatoms in the chain. For example, use `[CX4][CX2H2][CX2H2][CX2H2][CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]` and ensure that there are no heteroatoms connected to the chain carbons.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Rule 7** - Enhance the SMARTS for detecting polyether chains by matching any number of ether linkages. Use a pattern with repetition, such as `[$([OX2][CX4])]{$([$([CX4][OX2])]),}2,}`, which matches two or more ether bonds in sequence.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Rule 8** - Specify the distance between bulky substituents and the carboxyl group. For bulky groups near the carboxyl, use `[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-][CX4][CX4][C;R]` to match a bulky ring directly connected within two carbons. For distant bulky groups, ensure there are four or more carbons separating the carboxyl and the bulky group.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Rule 9** - Refine the pattern for N-acylated amino acids or peptides by matching the acylation at the nitrogen. Use a pattern like `[NX3][CX3](=O)[#6]` where the nitrogen is acylated, and connected to an amino acid backbone.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Rule 10** - Generalize the pattern for aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles. Use a SMARTS like `c1ccc2c(c1)oc(=O)c2` to match various fused bicyclic structures containing oxygen.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Rule 11** - Accurately count the number of carbons in aliphatic linkers. Use SMARTS with specific repeats, such as `[c][CX4]{$([CX4]),$([CX4][CX4])}[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]`, and distinguish between linkers with fewer than four carbons and those with four or more.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Rule 12** - Differentiate aliphatic and aromatic thiols by using `[CX4][SX2H]` for aliphatic thiols proximal to the carboxyl group and `c[SX2H]` for aromatic thiols. Ensure the thiol is within two carbons of the carboxylate.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Rule 13** - Enhance the aldehyde group detection by using the pattern `[CX3H1](=O)[#6]`, ensuring it matches aldehydes but not ketones or acids. Exclude carboxylic acids by ensuring the carbonyl carbon is not bonded to oxygen.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Rule 14** - Adjust the pattern to detect multiple hydroxyl groups proximal to the carboxyl group with patterns like `[CX4][OX2H][CX4][OX2H][CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]`, capturing molecules with adjacent hydroxyls near the acid group.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

**Overview:**

The current set of rules aims to predict high or low yields in a catalytic reaction based on the structural features of molecular modifiers. The effectiveness of these rules is evaluated using metrics such as support, confidence, lift, and leverage. We will focus on **confidence** and **lift**, as requested, to assess the performance of the current rules compared to previous iterations.

---

**Current Metrics:**

- **Training Support:** 0.04898 (4.90%)
- **Training Confidence:** 0.6531 (65.31%)
- **Training Lift:** 1.3147
- **Training Leverage:** 0.00886

**Previous Metrics for Reference:**

- **Training Confidence:** [0.6352 (63.52%), 0.5396 (53.96%)]
- **Training Lift:** [1.2048, 1.0559]

---

**Performance Evaluation:**

1. **Confidence:**

   - **Definition:** Confidence measures the proportion of cases where the rule's conditions and predictions are both true out of all cases where the rule's conditions are true.
   - **Current Confidence:** **65.31%**
   - **Previous Confidence:** **63.52%** and **53.96%**

   **Analysis:**
   - The current confidence of **65.31%** is higher than both previous values.
   - This indicates an improvement in the accuracy of the rules; when the rule conditions are met, the prediction of high or low yield is correct approximately **65%** of the time.
   - The increase in confidence suggests that the current rules are better at correctly predicting outcomes based on the structural features identified.

2. **Lift:**

   - **Definition:** Lift measures how much more likely the predicted outcome is given the rule conditions compared to the baseline probability of the outcome.
   - **Current Lift:** **1.3147**
   - **Previous Lift:** **1.2048** and **1.0559**

   **Analysis:**
   - A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is effective in improving the prediction over random chance.
   - The current lift of **1.3147** is higher than previous values, signifying that the rules are more valuable in distinguishing between high and low yields.
   - The increased lift demonstrates that the identified structural features are more strongly associated with the reaction outcomes than before.

3. **Support:**

   - Although not the main focus, it's worth noting that the current support is **4.90%**, which is lower than previous values (**16.67%** and **18.45%**).
   - This indicates that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.
   - A lower support with higher confidence and lift suggests that the rules are more precise but may have limited applicability.

---

**Assessment of Iterations and Local Minimum:**

- **Iterations Observed:** Multiple iterations with varying metrics.
- **Trend Analysis:**
  - **Confidence** has increased over iterations, suggesting improvement in prediction accuracy.
  - **Lift** has also shown an upward trend, indicating better association between rule conditions and outcomes.
  - **Support** has decreased, which may imply increasing rule specificity.
- **Local Minimum Assessment:**
  - The improvements in confidence and lift appear to be leveling off, with marginal gains in recent iterations.
  - This plateau may indicate that a local minimum has been reached in optimizing the current set of rules.
  - Continuing iterations without significant changes may not yield substantial improvements.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Balance Precision with Coverage:**

   - **Issue:** High confidence and lift with low support suggest that the rules are precise but cover a small subset of data.
   - **Action:** Consider generalizing some rules to increase support while maintaining acceptable confidence.
     - **Example:** Combine similar rules where appropriate to capture more data points.

2. **Incorporate Validation with Test Data:**

   - **Issue:** Current metrics are based solely on training data, risking overfitting.
   - **Action:** Evaluate the rules using a separate test dataset to assess their generalizability.
     - Monitor confidence and lift on test data to ensure the rules perform well on unseen data.

3. **Analyze Feature Importance:**

   - **Issue:** Certain structural features may have a more significant impact on yield.
   - **Action:** Use statistical methods or machine learning techniques to identify and prioritize the most influential features.
     - Refine rules to focus on combinations of features that contribute most to high confidence and lift.

4. **Optimize Rule Complexity:**

   - **Issue:** Some rules may be overly complex, limiting their applicability and interpretability.
   - **Action:** Simplify rules where possible without sacrificing performance.
     - Streamlined rules are easier to apply and may generalize better to new data.

5. **Explore Alternative Rule-Induction Methods:**

   - **Issue:** Current approach may have reached its optimization limit.
   - **Action:** Utilize other rule-generation techniques such as decision trees, random forests, or association rule mining algorithms.
     - These methods might uncover new patterns or relationships not evident through manual rule crafting.

6. **Engage Domain Expertise:**

   - **Issue:** Chemical intuition may reveal factors not captured in the current rules.
   - **Action:** Collaborate with chemists to review the rules and suggest modifications based on chemical knowledge.
     - This can help identify overlooked factors or correct any misinterpretations of chemical behavior.

7. **Address Overfitting Concerns:**

   - **Issue:** High performance on training data may not translate to real-world scenarios.
   - **Action:** Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure the rules are robust and not overfit to the training data.
     - Adjust rules based on cross-validation results to improve generalizability.

8. **Increase Dataset Diversity:**

   - **Issue:** Limited data may restrict the ability to generalize rules.
   - **Action:** Augment the dataset with more examples, especially those that fall outside the current rules' coverage.
     - A more diverse dataset can help in creating rules with higher support.

9. **Monitor Leverage and Other Metrics:**

   - **Issue:** Although not the primary focus, metrics like leverage provide insights into the rules' added value over chance.
   - **Action:** Ensure leverage remains positive and monitor trends alongside confidence and lift.
     - A positive leverage indicates a meaningful association between rule conditions and outcomes.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current rules exhibit improved **confidence** and **lift** compared to previous iterations, indicating better predictive performance for the specified reaction yields. However, the **support** has decreased, suggesting that the rules, while accurate, apply to a smaller subset of cases.

To enhance the rules further:

- **Aim for a balance** between accuracy and applicability by adjusting rule specificity.
- **Validate** the rules on test data to ensure they generalize well beyond the training set.
- **Incorporate domain knowledge** and advanced analytical methods to refine the rules.
- **Consider alternative approaches** if further iterations do not yield significant improvements.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be improved to provide reliable predictions with broader applicability, ultimately aiding in the rational design of molecular modifiers for optimal catalytic performance.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

After analyzing the latest training results, the current set of rules appears to be less effective compared to previous iterations. The key points from the performance metrics are:

- **Current Model Accuracy**: The model achieved an accuracy of **57.14%** on the 5-fold cross-validation.
- **Previous Accuracies**: Earlier models consistently achieved higher accuracies, with validation accuracies around **76%** and test accuracies between **62.5%** and **75%**.
- **Decrease in Performance**: The drop from approximately **76%** to **57%** indicates that the current rules are not capturing the necessary patterns to predict the modifier loading accurately.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Underfitting Indication**: The significant decrease in accuracy suggests that the model may be **underfitting**. The rules might be too simplistic or not adequately capturing the complexity of the data.
- **Lack of Generalization**: The model's inability to maintain high accuracy implies poor generalization to unseen data, reinforcing the underfitting concern.

**Analysis of Discrepancies**

To identify problematic rules, we examine cases where the model's predictions do not align with experimental values:

1. **Overestimations (Predicted High, Experimental Low)**:
   - **Molecules**:
     - *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
     - *CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O*
     - *C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F*
     - *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*
     - *C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O*
     - *CC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
     - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)C(=O)O*
     - *CSCC[C@@H](C(=O)NCC(=O)O)N*
     - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O*
     - *C(COCCOCCN)C(=O)O*
     - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)S*
     - *COCCOCCOCC(=O)O*
   - **Common Factor**: These molecules are predicted to have a high modifier loading, but experimentally, they exhibit a low loading.
   - **Identified Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule 3**: Consistently shows high positive SHAP values, contributing significantly to the overprediction.
     - **Rule 9**: Also exhibits high positive SHAP values in several overestimated cases.

2. **Underestimations (Predicted Low, Experimental High)**:
   - **Molecule**: *C(CCN)CC(=O)O*
   - **Issue**: The model predicts a low modifier loading, but the experimental value is high.
   - **Identified Rule with High Negative SHAP Value**:
     - **Rule 3**: Shows a substantial negative SHAP value, leading to the underprediction of modifier loading.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

- **Probability of Improvement**: The current metrics indicate that there's ample room for improvement in the rules. The low accuracy and identified discrepancies suggest that refining the problematic rules could enhance the model's performance.
- **Effectiveness of Current Rules**: The decrease in accuracy and the misclassifications point to inefficiencies in the current rules, particularly **Rule 3** and **Rule 9**.

**Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule 3 Issues**:
  - **Overestimations**: High positive SHAP values in overestimated cases imply that Rule 3 is incorrectly boosting predictions toward high modifier loading.
  - **Underestimations**: A high negative SHAP value in the underestimated case suggests that Rule 3 is suppressing the prediction when it should not.

- **Rule 9 Issues**:
  - **Overestimations**: Positive SHAP values indicate that Rule 9 is inadvertently contributing to higher predictions, contrary to its intended effect.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule 3**:
   - **Current Statement**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups within two carbons of the carboxylate lead to a high yield; those with these groups more than four carbons away lead to a low yield.*
   - **Issues Identified**:
     - The rule may be too broad, capturing modifiers that do not necessarily lead to high yields.
     - The proximity condition might not be stringent enough.
   - **Proposed Adjustments**:
     - **Narrow the Proximity Criteria**: Specify that only amino or hydroxyl groups directly adjacent (α-position) to the carboxylate lead to a high yield.
     - **Include Steric Considerations**: Introduce conditions to account for steric hindrance that may affect the modifier's ability to coordinate with the catalyst.
     - **Update Rule 3**:
       - **Revised Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or hydroxyl group directly attached to the α-carbon of the carboxylate group (i.e., α-amino or α-hydroxy acids) lead to a high yield. Modifiers with these groups further away do not significantly enhance coordination and may lead to a low yield.*

2. **Adjust Rule 9**:
   - **Current Statement**: *Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids or peptides lead to a low yield.*
   - **Issues Identified**:
     - Positive SHAP values suggest the rule may be misapplied or incorrectly weighted.
   - **Proposed Adjustments**:
     - **Verify Rule Implementation**: Ensure that the rule correctly identifies N-acylated amino acids and assigns a negative contribution toward high loading predictions.
     - **Include Exceptions**: If certain N-acylated amino acids actually lead to high yields, update the rule to reflect these exceptions.
     - **Update Rule 9**:
       - **Revised Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids or peptides generally lead to a low yield due to reduced availability of coordination sites. However, N-acylated amino acids with additional coordination functional groups proximal to the carboxylate may still lead to a high yield.*

3. **Incorporate Additional Rules or Modify Existing Ones**:

   - **Rule 8 Refinement**:
     - **Observation**: Bulky substituents near the carboxyl group may cause overestimations.
     - **Action**: Refine Rule 8 to better account for steric hindrance and its impact on modifier effectiveness.
     - **Update Rule 8**:
       - **Revised Rule 8**: *Modifiers with bulky substituents (e.g., aromatic rings, branched alkyl groups) directly adjacent to the carboxyl group lead to a low yield due to steric hindrance impairing coordination. If bulky groups are separated by at least two carbons from the carboxylate, their impact on yield diminishes.*

4. **Address Underfitting through Rule Expansion**:

   - **Expand Rule Coverage**: Introduce new rules to capture patterns not currently represented, especially for molecules that are frequently misclassified.
   - **Example New Rule**:
     - **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., halogens) at positions that enhance carboxylate acidity lead to a high yield due to stronger metal coordination.*

5. **Re-evaluate Rule Weightings**:

   - **SHAP Value Adjustments**: Adjust the weightings associated with each rule based on their SHAP values and impact on model predictions.
   - **Implementation**: Assign lower weights to rules that contribute to misclassifications and higher weights to those that align with correct predictions.

6. **Improve Generalization**:

   - **Cross-Validation Strategies**: Employ more robust cross-validation techniques to assess model performance and avoid overfitting to specific data subsets.
   - **Data Augmentation**: If possible, expand the dataset with additional modifiers to provide a more comprehensive training base.

7. **Iterative Refinement and Testing**:

   - **Continuous Evaluation**: After implementing rule adjustments, retrain the model and evaluate performance improvements.
   - **SHAP Analysis Feedback Loop**: Use SHAP values in each iteration to identify and correct new issues, ensuring that rule modifications lead to desired outcomes.

**Conclusion**

The current rules exhibit limitations that reduce the model's predictive accuracy. Key rules, specifically **Rule 3** and **Rule 9**, contribute to misclassifications due to their broad scope or potential misimplementation. By refining these rules to be more precise and ensuring they align with experimental observations, the model's performance can be improved. Additionally, addressing underfitting through the introduction of new rules and re-evaluating rule weightings will enhance the model's ability to generalize and accurately predict modifier loadings.

**Next Steps**

1. **Implement Rule Adjustments**: Apply the proposed refinements to **Rule 3**, **Rule 9**, and **Rule 8**.
2. **Retrain the Model**: Use the updated rules to generate the feature matrix and retrain the classification model.
3. **Evaluate Performance**: Assess the new model's accuracy and analyze SHAP values to verify improvements.
4. **Iterate as Necessary**: Continue refining the rules based on performance metrics and SHAP analysis until satisfactory accuracy is achieved.

By following these recommendations, we expect to enhance the model's predictive capabilities and achieve better alignment with experimental results.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

**Background:**

You are working on optimizing the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols. The reaction uses various molecular modifiers to affect the reactivity of the catalyst. The aim is to extract rules from SMILES representations to predict whether a modifier will lead to a high or low reaction yield.

**Current Situation:**

- A set of rules has been established to predict modifier performance based on structural features.
- Metrics such as training support, confidence, lift, and leverage have been used to evaluate these rules.
- While the current rules show improvements in confidence and lift compared to previous iterations, there are concerns about their specificity and ability to generalize.

**Key Issues Identified:**

- Some rules are too broad or not sufficiently precise, leading to misclassifications.
- Certain SMARTS patterns used in the rules may not accurately capture the intended molecular features.
- Rules such as **Rule 2** and **Rule 3** require refinement to improve accuracy.
- **SHAP analysis** has identified specific rules contributing to incorrect predictions.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Electron Effects:**

   - **Rule 2 (Electron-Withdrawing and Electron-Donating Groups):**
     - **Define Specific EWGs and EDGs:** Create precise SMARTS patterns for common electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like nitro `[N+](=O)[O-]`, cyano `C#N`, and halogens `[F,Cl,Br,I]`, and electron-donating groups (EDGs) like methyl `[CH3]`, methoxy `[OCH3]`, amino `[NH2]`, and hydroxy `[OH]`.
     - **Ensure Positional Specificity:** Modify patterns to detect substituents specifically at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. For example, use `c1ccc(cc1)[C](=O)O` with appropriate substitutions at the para position.

2. **Improve Detection of Functional Group Proximity:**

   - **Rule 3 (Proximity of Amino or Hydroxyl Groups):**
     - **Specify Exact Distances:** Use SMARTS patterns that count the number of atoms between functional groups and the carboxylate. For proximal groups, patterns like `[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-][CX4][CX4][NX3;H2,H1]` can be used.
     - **Differentiate Distant Groups:** Create separate patterns for groups beyond four carbons away, ensuring accurate classification.

3. **Enhance Specificity for Heterocycles:**

   - **Rule 4 (Aromatic Heterocycles with Nitrogen):**
     - **Direct Attachment:** Adjust SMARTS patterns to ensure the nitrogen atom is part of the heterocycle directly attached to the carboxyl group, e.g., `[n][c](=O)[O;H1,-]`.

4. **Generalize Detection of Perfluorinated Chains:**

   - **Rule 5 (Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains):**
     - **Use Recursive Patterns:** Implement patterns that match chains of fully fluorinated carbons of any length, such as `[CX4](F)(F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)[CX4,F]*`.

5. **Exclude Additional Functional Groups:**

   - **Rule 6 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids):**
     - **Ensure No Heteroatoms:** Refine patterns to exclude molecules with heteroatoms in the aliphatic chain, focusing on hydrocarbons only.

6. **Detect Polyether Chains Accurately:**

   - **Rule 7 (Polyether Chains):**
     - **Match Multiple Ether Linkages:** Use patterns like `[$([OX2][CX4])]{$([$([CX4][OX2])]),}2,}` to detect two or more sequential ether bonds.

7. **Account for Steric Hindrance:**

   - **Rule 8 (Bulky Substituents Near Carboxyl Group):**
     - **Specify Distance:** Modify SMARTS patterns to reflect bulky groups within two carbons of the carboxylate, e.g., `[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-][CX4][CX4][C;R]`.

8. **Differentiate Thiol Group Types:**

   - **Rule 12 (Thiol Groups):**
     - **Separate Aliphatic and Aromatic Thiols:** Use `[CX4][SX2H]` for aliphatic thiols proximal to the carboxyl group and `c[SX2H]` for aromatic thiols.

9. **Improve Aldehyde Detection:**

   - **Rule 13 (Aldehyde Groups):**
     - **Precise Pattern:** Use `[CX3H1](=O)[#6]` to match aldehyde groups while excluding ketones and carboxylic acids.

10. **Adjust for N-Acylation Effects:**

    - **Rule 9 (N-Acylated Amino Acids or Peptides):**
      - **Identify N-Acylation Correctly:** Refine patterns to match acylated nitrogen atoms, e.g., `[NX3][CX3](=O)[#6]`.

11. **Introduce Additional Rules:**

    - **Rule 15 (Electron-Withdrawing Substituents Enhancing Acidity):**
      - **New Rule:** Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing substituents that enhance the acidity of the carboxylate may lead to higher yields due to stronger metal coordination.

**Directions for Optimization:**

- **Balance Specificity and Coverage:**
  - Ensure rules are specific enough to improve accuracy but general enough to apply to a broader range of modifiers.

- **Iterative Model Refinement:**
  - After implementing changes, retrain the model and evaluate performance using cross-validation and SHAP analysis to identify areas for further improvement.

- **Engage Domain Expertise:**
  - Work with chemists to validate the rules and ensure they align with chemical principles and experimental observations.

- **Validate with External Data:**
  - Test the refined rules on an independent dataset to assess generalizability and prevent overfitting.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Given the identified issues and the proposed suggestions, there is clear potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. Refining the SMARTS patterns and adjusting rule definitions should enhance the model's accuracy and applicability, ensuring that it captures the true relationships between molecular structures and reaction yields.
