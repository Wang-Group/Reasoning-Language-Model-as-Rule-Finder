**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar substituents**—such as hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH₂), or ether groups—tend to result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. In contrast, **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents** or **longer chain lengths (more than eight carbons)** tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position**—such as nitro (-NO₂) or bromomethyl (-CH₂Br) groups—lead to **high yield**. Examples: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. Conversely, **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents at the para position**—such as methyl (-CH₃) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups—result in **low yield**. Examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. Notably, **para-amino (-NH₂) groups** are an exception and result in **high yield**, as seen with **4-aminobenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**, specifically those containing an additional carboxylic acid group beyond the alpha-carboxyl, lead to **high yield**. Examples: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. In contrast, **omega-amino acids with chain lengths greater than five carbons** result in **low yield**. Examples: **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings separated from hydrophilic groups (e.g., hydroxyl groups) by aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. An example is **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**. Conversely, **modifiers where hydrophilic groups are directly attached to the aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. Examples include **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. However, **when the nitrogen-containing heterocycle is connected via an additional aromatic ring**, as in **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, the yield is **low**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. In contrast, **modifiers with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings**, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**. The abundance of hydroxyl groups may enhance interactions with the catalyst through hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds**, particularly those formed by acylation of amino acids or linking amino acid residues, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, including polyether chains, result in **low yield**. Examples are **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated alkyl chains** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may hinder effective coordination with the catalytic sites.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic aromatic side chains**, particularly those containing an indole ring, lead to **high yield**. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan). In contrast, **amino acids with less bulky aromatic side chains**, like **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to an aromatic ring within a fused lactone or ketone structure** lead to **high yield**. An example is **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**. The carbonyl groups may facilitate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains terminated with aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (C=O) groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**. The presence of these groups may interfere with catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents on the aliphatic chain**, such as methoxy groups or other large functional groups, tend to result in **high yield**. An example is **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**. The bulky groups may enhance binding affinity to the catalyst.
