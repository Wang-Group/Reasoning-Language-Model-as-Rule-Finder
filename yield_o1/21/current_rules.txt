**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with an additional carboxylic acid group (amino dicarboxylic acids)** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites, enhancing binding to the metal center of the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a primary amino group located on a short aliphatic chain of five carbons or fewer (short-chain omega-amino acids)** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates effective bidentate coordination with minimal steric hindrance. Conversely, **similar amino acids with longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and steric hindrance reducing effective coordination. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating coordinating groups such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxy (-OH) groups at the para position** result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. These groups enhance interaction with the metal center through coordination. In contrast, **modifiers where the substituent at the para position is a non-coordinating group (e.g., methyl group)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. Electron-donating but non-coordinating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO₂) at the para position** result in **high yield**. An example is **4-nitrobenzoic acid**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. The nitrogen atoms increase electron density and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group and a thiol (-SH) group on a short aliphatic chain (three carbons or fewer)** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain may facilitate favorable interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, enhancing binding.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages, especially polyether chains extending from the carboxylic acid** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may disrupt optimal coordination with the catalyst by introducing flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with amide bonds linking functional groups or amino acids (containing amide linkages)** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing groups attached to the carboxylic acid, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The adjacent carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups along with a carboxylic acid group on an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst’s active sites.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with heteroaromatic substituents at the para position** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. The steric hindrance and electronic effects of the bulky heteroaromatic group may impede effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with phenolic groups attached to a propanoic acid chain (where the hydroxyphenyl group is not directly attached to the carboxyl group)** result in **low yield**. An example is **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**. The increased distance between the phenolic hydroxyl group and the carboxyl group may reduce the overall coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains (aromatic rings)** result in **low yield**. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine). The bulky side chain may cause steric hindrance, preventing optimal interaction with the catalyst.
