**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains, such as **aspartic acid** ((2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) and **glutamic acid** ((2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid), or with aromatic heterocyclic side chains like **tryptophan** ((2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid), are associated with **high yield**.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position, such as **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (para-nitro substituent) and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (para-bromomethyl substituent), lead to **high yield**.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing heterocyclic aromatic rings, such as pyridine rings in **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, or a pyrazole ring in **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, are associated with **high yield**.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with sulfhydryl (-SH) groups on aliphatic chains, like **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, result in **high yield**, whereas those with -SH groups attached directly to aromatic rings, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, lead to **low yield**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with unfunctionalized aliphatic chains, such as **octanoic acid**, tend to give **high yield**, while those with polar substituents (e.g., hydroxyl -OH or amino -NH₂ groups) on the aliphatic chain, like **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, lead to **low yield**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups, such as **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, are associated with **low yield**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with aldehyde (-CHO) or keto (>C=O) groups on aliphatic chains, such as **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, tend to result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain, such as **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), are associated with **high yield**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids without additional acidic side chains, such as **phenylalanine** ((2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid), are associated with **low yield**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with methoxy (-OCH₃) substituents on aromatic rings, particularly when combined with a suitable linker between the ring and the carboxylic acid group, like in **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**, lead to **high yield**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains substituted with polar functional groups, such as **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (hydroxyl group) and **8-aminooctanoic acid** (amino group), tend to give **low yield**.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and appropriately specific, with adequate physical-chemical insight regarding the role of acidic and aromatic heterocyclic side chains in amino acids. It covers multiple data points (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and tryptophan) that support the high yield outcome, demonstrating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight into how strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids influence the reaction to produce high yield. The rule is supported by multiple data points (4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid) and effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is generally clear and based on reasonable physical-chemical insight regarding the role of heterocyclic aromatic rings in enhancing yield. However, there is a conflicting data point (**4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**) that exhibits low yield despite containing a heterocyclic aromatic ring, suggesting the rule may require refinement. The coverage is sufficient but could benefit from addressing exceptions to improve balance and accuracy.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and effectively distinguishes between sulfhydryl groups on aliphatic chains and those attached directly to aromatic rings, reflecting meaningful physical-chemical insight. The rule is supported by two data points (**3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** with high yield and **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** with low yield), demonstrating appropriate coverage and balance.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 provides a clear guideline distinguishing between unfunctionalized aliphatic carboxylic acids and those with polar substituents on the chain, supported by multiple data points (**octanoic acid** with high yield versus **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid** with low yield). The rule demonstrates solid physical-chemical insight and maintains an effective balance of complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups result in low yield, which is supported by two data points (**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**). The rule offers reasonable physical-chemical insight and maintains appropriate complexity and coverage for the dataset.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and grounded in physical-chemical rationale, as aldehyde and keto groups on aliphatic chains can affect reactivity, leading to low yield. The rule is supported by two data points (**4-oxoheptanedioic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) and maintains an appropriate level of complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear but lacks sufficient coverage, as it is supported by only one data point (**gluconic acid**). While the physical-chemical insight is plausible, the rule would benefit from additional supporting data to confirm its validity and enhance its balance and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear but lacks sufficient coverage, being based primarily on a single data point (**phenylalanine**). While the rule differentiates between types of aromatic amino acids, it would be strengthened by additional data points to confirm its general applicability and improve balance.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is specific but lacks sufficient coverage, being supported primarily by a single data point (**4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**). While the physical-chemical rationale regarding methoxy substituents and linkers is reasonable, additional data points are necessary to confirm the rule's validity and enhance balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and provides physical-chemical insight into how polar functional groups on long aliphatic chains may lead to low yield. The rule is supported by multiple data points (**7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**). However, the case of **5-aminopentanoic acid**, which has a shorter chain and results in high yield, suggests that chain length may be a factor, and the rule could be refined to specify the influence of chain length on yield to improve balance and accuracy.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains, such as **aspartic acid** ((2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) and **glutamic acid** ((2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid), or with aromatic heterocyclic side chains like **tryptophan** ((2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid), are associated with **high yield**.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position, such as **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (para-nitro substituent) and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (para-bromomethyl substituent), lead to **high yield**.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with sulfhydryl (-SH) groups on aliphatic chains, like **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, result in **high yield**, whereas those with -SH groups attached directly to aromatic rings, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, lead to **low yield**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with unfunctionalized aliphatic chains, such as **octanoic acid**, tend to give **high yield**, while those with polar substituents (e.g., hydroxyl -OH or amino -NH₂ groups) on the aliphatic chain, like **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, lead to **low yield**.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Modify Rule 2 to include electron-withdrawing groups like bromomethyl.**

  The current SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) on aromatic rings in Rule 2 are `'[c][F,Cl,Br,I]'` and `'[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]'`, which capture halogens and nitro groups directly attached to the aromatic ring. However, the example **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** has a bromomethyl group (`-CH₂Br`) at the para position, which is not captured by these patterns. 

  **Suggestion:** Expand the `ewg_on_aromatic` patterns to include alkyl halides attached to aromatic rings, such as bromomethyl groups. You can add a pattern like `'[c][CH2][Br,Cl,I,F]'` to capture bromomethyl and similar substituents. This will ensure that compounds like **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** are correctly identified under Rule 2.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Revise Rule 4 to assign '-1' when the sulfhydryl group is attached directly to an aromatic ring.**

  Currently, Rule 4 only predicts a high yield (`prediction: 1`) when a sulfhydryl group is on an aliphatic chain and does not assign any prediction when the sulfhydryl group is attached to an aromatic ring. The example **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** should result in a low yield prediction (`prediction: -1`), but the code doesn't capture this.

  **Suggestion:** Modify Rule 4 by splitting it into two separate rules or adjusting it to assign `prediction: -1` when the `sulfhydryl_aromatic` pattern is matched. Here's how you can adjust the rule:

  - For high yield (`prediction: 1`):
    - **Patterns:** `[sulfhydryl_aliphatic]` and `[carboxylic_acid]`
    - **Exclude Patterns:** `[sulfhydryl_aromatic]`
    - **Logic:** 'and'
  - For low yield (`prediction: -1`):
    - **Patterns:** `[sulfhydryl_aromatic]`
    - **Logic:** 'and'

  This ensures that compounds with an -SH group on an aromatic ring are correctly predicted to have a low yield.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Adjust Rule 5 to assign '-1' for modifiers with polar substituents on aliphatic chains.**

  In the current code, Rule 5 only assigns a high yield (`prediction: 1`) when an unfunctionalized aliphatic chain is present and does not assign any prediction when polar substituents are on the chain. However, the rule states that such modifiers lead to low yield.

  **Suggestion:** Modify Rule 5 to include a low yield prediction when polar substituents on aliphatic chains are detected. You can adjust the rule as follows:

  - For high yield (`prediction: 1`):
    - **Patterns:** `[long_aliphatic_chain]` and `[carboxylic_acid]`
    - **Exclude Patterns:** `[polar_substituent_on_aliphatic]`
    - **Logic:** 'and'
  - For low yield (`prediction: -1`):
    - **Patterns:** `[long_aliphatic_chain]`, `[carboxylic_acid]`, and `[polar_substituent_on_aliphatic]`
    - **Logic:** 'and'

  This adjustment will correctly assign a low yield to compounds like **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid** under Rule 5.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Enhance the pattern for multiple hydroxyl groups in Rule 8 to match compounds like gluconic acid.**

  The current pattern for detecting multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain is `'[OX2H][CX4][OX2H]'`, which may not capture compounds with more than two adjacent hydroxyl groups or those with branching.

  **Suggestion:** Update the `multiple_aliphatic_OH` pattern to detect multiple hydroxyl groups regardless of their position on the chain. A possible pattern could be `'[CX4;!$(C(=O))](O)([CX4;!$(C(=O))](O))'` or use recursive SMARTS to find molecules with at least three hydroxyl groups attached to aliphatic carbons. This will ensure that compounds like **gluconic acid** are correctly identified and assigned a high yield prediction under Rule 8.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Resolve conflicting predictions between overlapping rules by establishing rule precedence.**

  Some compounds may match multiple rules with conflicting predictions (e.g., both high and low yield). For instance, **gluconic acid** should be predicted as high yield under Rule 8 but may also match Rule 11, which predicts low yield.

  **Suggestion:** Implement a rule precedence system where certain rules have higher priority when conflicts arise. For example, you can assign higher priority to Rule 8 over Rule 11. Alternatively, adjust the code to sum up the predictions and make a final decision based on the net value.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Review and refine SMARTS patterns for accuracy and completeness.**

  Some SMARTS patterns may be too specific or not fully capture the intended functional groups. For example, the pattern for aromatic amino acids in Rule 9 (`'[NX3H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[#6][c]'`) may not match all aromatic amino acids without acidic side chains.

  **Suggestion:** Re-evaluate the SMARTS patterns for each rule to ensure they accurately represent the chemical structures described. Utilize cheminformatics tools to test and refine these patterns against known examples and counter-examples.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Expand patterns to include tautomers and resonance structures.**

  Some compounds may exist in multiple tautomeric forms, and the SMARTS patterns should account for this variability.

  **Suggestion:** Include additional patterns or use more general SMARTS definitions that can match different tautomeric forms or resonance structures of the target functional groups.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Ensure consistency in logic handling across all rules.**

  The logic used in handling patterns (e.g., 'and', 'or', 'and (either)') should be consistently applied. Any custom logic like 'and (either)' should be clearly implemented and tested.

  **Suggestion:** Review the implementation of custom logic operations in the code to ensure they work as intended. For complex logic, consider breaking down the conditions into simpler, sequential checks.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Reframe the Rules to Focus on Quantifiable Molecular Descriptors**

  Modify the current rules to emphasize quantifiable and computable molecular descriptors that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For instance, instead of using qualitative terms like "long aliphatic chains," specify the exact number of carbon atoms that define "long." This will enable the creation of a numerical feature matrix. Example:

  - Change Rule 5 from "Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with unfunctionalized aliphatic chains, such as octanoic acid, tend to give high yield" to "Modifiers with straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids containing 6–8 carbon atoms result in high yield."

- **Advice 2**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions and Counts**

  Clearly define and standardize the functional groups mentioned in the rules, and specify their counts where relevant. This aids in automated feature extraction from SMILES. For example:

  - Update Rule 4 to specify the position and count of sulfhydryl groups: "Modifiers with a single sulfhydryl (-SH) group attached to the third carbon of a propanoic acid chain result in high yield."

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Molecular Properties and Electronic Effects Numerically**

  Replace qualitative descriptions of electronic effects with quantifiable parameters like Hammett sigma constants or computed partial charges. For example:

  - Amend Rule 2 to include quantifiable electron-withdrawing effects: "Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents having Hammett sigma values greater than +0.7 lead to high yield."

- **Advice 4**: **Utilize Molecular Fingerprints and Descriptors**

  Employ molecular fingerprints (e.g., ECFP, MACCS keys) and descriptors that convert molecular structures into numerical vectors. Update the rules to align with these descriptors, facilitating easier generation of the feature matrix. For instance:

  - Express the presence of specific substructures using fingerprint bit positions, allowing for binary numerical representation in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 5**: **Consolidate and Merge Overlapping Rules**

  Identify and merge rules that overlap or are similar to reduce complexity and redundancy. This streamlines the rule set and simplifies feature extraction. For example:

  - Combine Rules 11 and 5 regarding modifiers with aliphatic chains and polar substituents affecting yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Specify Exact Structural Features Using SMARTS Patterns**

  Use SMARTS notation to precisely define the structural features associated with high or low yield. This enables automated parsing of SMILES strings to detect these features. For example:

  - Define Rule 3 modifiers as those containing heteroaromatic rings matching specific SMARTS patterns, such as "[nH]1cnccc1" for a pyridine ring.

- **Advice 7**: **Include Physicochemical Properties Thresholds**

  Incorporate numerical thresholds for physicochemical properties like LogP, molecular weight, or polar surface area in the rules. This aids in quantifying the rules and extracting numerical features. For example:

  - Add a rule: "Modifiers with a calculated LogP value between 1 and 3 are associated with high yield."

- **Advice 8**: **Clarify Stereochemistry When Relevant**

  Specify stereochemistry in the rules if it impacts the yield, ensuring that the numerical features capture chiral centers where necessary. For example:

  - Modify Rule 8 to state: "Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain in specific stereochemical configurations are associated with high yield."

- **Advice 9**: **Automate Feature Extraction with Cheminformatics Software**

  Utilize cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit) to automate the extraction of numerical features from SMILES strings based on the updated rules. Ensure that the rules are compatible with these tools' capabilities.

- **Advice 10**: **Provide Examples and Counterexamples for Each Rule**

  For each rule, include representative examples and counterexamples from the dataset to illustrate how the rule applies. This supports validation and refinement of the rules during feature generation.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**—specifically, those containing an additional carboxylic acid group—such as **aspartic acid** ((2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) and **glutamic acid** ((2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid), lead to **high yield**.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as nitro (-NO₂) or bromomethyl (-CH₂Br) substituents, result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles**, such as pyridine or pyrazole rings, are associated with **high yield**. Examples are **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched chains and no polar substituents** (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups), such as **octanoic acid**, lead to **high yield**. In contrast, similar aliphatic acids with polar substituents on the chain, especially at terminal positions, result in **low yield**. Examples of low-yield modifiers are **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid**, such as **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, result in **low yield** due to the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms affecting catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain**, like **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), lead to **high yield** by enhancing solubility and catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) functional groups** tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, where these groups may deactivate the catalyst or interfere with the reaction pathway.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups on aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**, as seen with **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, due to potential coordination with metal centers. Conversely, **modifiers with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings**, like **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**, possibly due to steric hindrance or deactivation of the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with uncharged polar side chains or basic side chains**, such as derivatives of serine, threonine, or lysine (e.g., **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**), tend to result in **low yield**. The presence of additional amino groups may lead to catalyst poisoning or side reactions.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with bulky side chains**, like **tryptophan** ((2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid), lead to **high yield**, possibly due to π-π interactions facilitating catalyst activity. In contrast, **modifiers with less bulky aromatic side chains**, such as **phenylalanine** ((2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid), result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that include amide linkages involving aromatic rings and aliphatic chains** tend to result in **low yield**. Examples are **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, where the amide bond may hinder effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings bearing hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position** can have variable effects. **Modifiers like 4-aminobenzoic acid**, with a para-amino group, lead to **high yield**, possibly due to favorable electronic effects. However, **derivatives of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid**, such as **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, tend to result in **low yield**, indicating that para-hydroxyl groups may negatively impact the reaction.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino carboxylic acids with a chain length of five carbons**, such as **5-aminopentanoic acid**, result in **high yield**, potentially due to optimal chain length for catalyst interaction. **Longer chain omega-amino acids**, like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, result in **low yield**, possibly because longer chains reduce the compound's ability to effectively interact with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially those containing polyether chains like triethylene glycol units, result in **low yield**. An example is **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, where the ether chains may sterically hinder catalyst access or alter solubility.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents connected via flexible aliphatic linkers**, where the linker is sufficiently long, can lead to **high yield**. For instance, **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (with a five-carbon linker) results in **high yield**, whereas **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (with a three-carbon linker) results in **low yield**, suggesting that longer linkers favor better catalyst interaction.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for easy determination of yield based on the presence of an additional carboxylic acid group in amino acids with acidic side chains, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, both showing high yield in the data. The rule provides good physical-chemical insight into how acidic side chains enhance catalyst interaction. It combines structural features effectively and is supported by at least two data points, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly identifies that modifiers which are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position lead to high yield, exemplified by 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid. The rule offers property insight into how electron-withdrawing groups affect catalyst reactivity. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple data points, meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 specifies that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles result in high yield, with examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid supported by the dataset. The rule is clear, provides good chemical insight into potential coordination with metal centers, considers structural complexity, and is backed by several data points, fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 effectively distinguishes between unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar groups (high yield) and those with polar substituents (low yield). Examples such as octanoic acid (high yield) and 7-aminoheptanoic acid (low yield) illustrate this distinction. The rule provides insight into the impact of polar substituents on the reaction, considers combinations of structural features, and is supported by multiple data points, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 identifies that modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield, as seen with 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid. While the rule is clear and provides property insight into electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms, it is supported by only one data point, which does not fully meet the coverage criterion. Additional data points would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in stating that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain lead to high yield, supported by gluconic acid and another similar compound in the dataset. It provides property insight into how increased solubility and catalyst interactions are enhanced by multiple hydroxyl groups. The rule considers combinations of substructures and meets the coverage requirement with at least two supporting data points.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly explains that modifiers containing aldehyde or ketone functional groups tend to result in low yield, with supporting data from 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-oxoheptanedioic acid. It offers chemical insight into how these groups may deactivate the catalyst or interfere with the reaction pathway. The rule considers functional group combinations and meets the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 effectively differentiates modifiers with thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) from those with thiol groups on aromatic rings (low yield), supported by data on 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid. It provides good property insight into how the position of the thiol group affects catalyst interaction. The rule's complexity and sufficient data support meet the criteria.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 suggests that modifiers which are amino acids with uncharged polar side chains or basic side chains tend to result in low yield, as exemplified by (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid. However, the rule lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one data point. While it provides property insight, additional data points are needed to confirm its validity and fully meet the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly distinguishes that aromatic amino acids with bulky side chains, like tryptophan, lead to high yield, while those with less bulky side chains, like phenylalanine, result in low yield. The rule provides valuable property insight into steric and electronic effects on catalyst activity. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by data on both modifiers, meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 accurately notes that modifiers with amide linkages involving aromatic rings and aliphatic chains tend to result in low yield, with examples like 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid. It provides some insight into how amide bonds may hinder effective catalyst interaction. The rule considers structural combinations and is supported by at least two data points, fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 addresses the effects of aromatic rings bearing hydroxyl groups at the para position, noting that para-amino groups lead to high yield (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid), whereas para-hydroxyl groups may result in low yield (e.g., derivatives of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid). While the rule provides property insight, it may lack clarity due to the variable effects and could benefit from being split into separate, more specific rules to improve clarity and application.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 effectively demonstrates that omega-amino carboxylic acids with a chain length of five carbons result in high yield, such as 5-aminopentanoic acid, while longer chains lead to low yield. It offers good property insight into the optimal chain length for catalyst interaction, considers structural complexity, and is well-supported by multiple data points, meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly states that modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid, especially those containing polyether chains, result in low yield, as shown by 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid. The rule provides insight into how ether chains may hinder catalyst access or alter solubility. It considers combinations of substructures and meets the coverage requirement with at least two supporting data points.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 illustrates that modifiers containing aromatic rings with electron-donating substituents connected via flexible aliphatic linkers, where the linker is sufficiently long, can lead to high yield, as seen with 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid. Conversely, shorter linkers result in low yield, exemplified by 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid. The rule is clear, offers property insight into linker length effects on catalyst interaction, considers combinations of substructures, and is supported by data, satisfying the coverage criterion.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**—specifically, those containing an additional carboxylic acid group—such as **aspartic acid** ((2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) and **glutamic acid** ((2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid), lead to **high yield**.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as nitro (-NO₂) or bromomethyl (-CH₂Br) substituents, result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles**, such as pyridine or pyrazole rings, are associated with **high yield**. Examples are **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched chains and no polar substituents** (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups), such as **octanoic acid**, lead to **high yield**. In contrast, similar aliphatic acids with polar substituents on the chain, especially at terminal positions, result in **low yield**. Examples of low-yield modifiers are **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid**, such as **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, result in **low yield** due to the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms affecting catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain**, like **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), lead to **high yield** by enhancing solubility and catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) functional groups** tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, where these groups may deactivate the catalyst or interfere with the reaction pathway.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups on aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**, as seen with **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, due to potential coordination with metal centers. Conversely, **modifiers with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings**, like **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**, possibly due to steric hindrance or deactivation of the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with uncharged polar side chains or basic side chains**, such as derivatives of serine, threonine, or lysine (e.g., **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**), tend to result in **low yield**. The presence of additional amino groups may lead to catalyst poisoning or side reactions.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with bulky side chains**, like **tryptophan** ((2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid), lead to **high yield**, possibly due to π-π interactions facilitating catalyst activity. In contrast, **modifiers with less bulky aromatic side chains**, such as **phenylalanine** ((2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid), result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that include amide linkages involving aromatic rings and aliphatic chains** tend to result in **low yield**. Examples are **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, where the amide bond may hinder effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings bearing hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position** can have variable effects. **Modifiers like 4-aminobenzoic acid**, with a para-amino group, lead to **high yield**, possibly due to favorable electronic effects. However, **derivatives of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid**, such as **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, tend to result in **low yield**, indicating that para-hydroxyl groups may negatively impact the reaction.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino carboxylic acids with a chain length of five carbons**, such as **5-aminopentanoic acid**, result in **high yield**, potentially due to optimal chain length for catalyst interaction. **Longer chain omega-amino acids**, like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, result in **low yield**, possibly because longer chains reduce the compound's ability to effectively interact with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially those containing polyether chains like triethylene glycol units, result in **low yield**. An example is **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, where the ether chains may sterically hinder catalyst access or alter solubility.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents connected via flexible aliphatic linkers**, where the linker is sufficiently long, can lead to **high yield**. For instance, **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (with a five-carbon linker) results in **high yield**, whereas **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (with a three-carbon linker) results in **low yield**, suggesting that longer linkers favor better catalyst interaction.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correctly Implement Count Thresholds in Rule 1**

  In Rule 1, the count threshold for the carboxylic acid group is not being correctly applied because `pat.GetSmarts()` may return a canonicalized or altered version of the SMARTS string, which doesn't match the key in the `count_threshold` dictionary. To fix this, consider using the original pattern strings as keys or assigning unique identifiers to patterns. Alternatively, store the compiled pattern objects as keys in the `count_threshold` dictionary. Modify the code to compare the pattern objects directly, for example:

  ```python
  # In the rule definition
  rule['count_threshold'] = {pat: threshold_value}

  # When checking the threshold
  if 'count_threshold' in rule and pat in rule['count_threshold']:
      threshold = rule['count_threshold'][pat]
      if len(matches) >= threshold:
          continue
      else:
          match = False
          break
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: **Handle 'OR' Conditions in Rule Patterns**

  For rules like Rule 2, where the presence of any one of multiple functional groups (e.g., nitro **or** bromomethyl) should trigger a match, the current code incorrectly requires all patterns to match. Modify the code to allow for 'OR' conditions by using a logical structure that checks if **any** of the specified patterns match. You can introduce an `any_patterns` key in the rule definition:

  ```python
  {
      'number': 2,
      'description': 'Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position, such as nitro or bromomethyl substituents',
      'patterns': [
          aromatic_carboxylic_acid,  # Aromatic carboxylic acid
      ],
      'any_patterns': [
          nitro_group,  # Nitro group
          bromomethyl  # Bromomethyl group
      ],
      'prediction': 1
  }
  ```

  In your code, implement logic to check that all patterns in `patterns` match, and at least one pattern in `any_patterns` matches.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Specify Positional Constraints in SMARTS Patterns**

  For rules involving positional specificity, such as substituents at the para position in Rule 2, include SMARTS patterns that specify the position of substituents on the aromatic ring. For example, define a SMARTS pattern for an aromatic ring with a para-substituted nitro group:

  ```python
  para_nitro_benzene = 'C1=CC([NX3](=O)=O)=CC=C1C(=O)O'  # Simplified example
  ```

  Use such patterns in your rule definitions to accurately capture positional requirements.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Combine Patterns to Reflect Specific Structural Contexts**

  Instead of listing separate patterns, combine them into a single SMARTS pattern that captures the specific structural context described in the rule. For Rule 2, you can define:

  ```python
  aromatic_carboxylic_acid_with_para_EWG = '[cH]1[cH][cH][c]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[cH][c]1[[$(N(=O)=O),$(CBr)]]'
  ```

  This pattern matches an aromatic carboxylic acid with a nitro or bromomethyl group at the para position.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Ensure Excluded Patterns Are Accurately Processed**

  Verify that the `exclude_patterns` in the rules are being correctly processed. The current code may not correctly identify molecules that should be excluded based on these patterns. Make sure that the exclusion logic sets `match` to `False` immediately upon finding a match with an excluded pattern.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Adjust Logic for Patterns That Independently Trigger Matches**

  For rules where any one of several patterns should independently trigger a match (logical 'OR'), adjust the code to reflect this. For Rule 7, where either an aldehyde or a ketone group results in a low yield, modify the rule to:

  ```python
  {
      'number': 7,
      'description': 'Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) functional groups',
      'any_patterns': [
          aldehyde_group,  # Aldehyde group
          ketone_group  # Ketone group
      ],
      'prediction': -1
  }
  ```

- **Suggestion 7**: **Use More Specific SMARTS Patterns for Complex Structures**

  For complex rules, such as Rule 15, where specific linker lengths and substituent positions are important, develop precise SMARTS patterns that capture these details. For instance:

  ```python
  aromatic_with_long_aliphatic_linker = '[c][CX4][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```

  This pattern represents an aromatic ring connected via a five-carbon linker to a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Add Comments and Documentation to the Code**

  Include comments explaining each SMARTS pattern and the logic behind the code sections, particularly for complex rules. This will enhance readability and make it easier to maintain and modify the code in the future.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Validate SMARTS Patterns Against Known Examples**

  Before applying the patterns to the full dataset, test each SMARTS pattern against known molecules that should match and those that should not. This helps ensure that the patterns are correctly defined and functioning as intended.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Review Logical Flow and Debug the Code**

  Thoroughly review the logical flow of the code to ensure that it aligns with the intended rule interpretations. Use debugging techniques, such as printing intermediate results, to trace how the code is processing each molecule and identify where it may be deviating from expected behavior.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**1. Train Support**

- **Current Value:** 0.0190
- **Previous Values:** 0.1667, 0.1845

The train support has significantly decreased from approximately **17%** and **18%** in previous iterations to **1.9%** in the current iteration. This sharp decline indicates that the current set of rules applies to a much smaller portion of the training data. A low support suggests that the rules are highly specific and may not capture broader patterns within the dataset.

**2. Train Confidence**

- **Current Value:** 0.6167
- **Previous Values:** 0.6352, 0.5396

The train confidence has remained relatively stable compared to previous iterations, hovering around **61.7%**. This indicates that when the current rules do apply, they predict the **high yield** outcome correctly approximately **62%** of the time. While this is a reasonably good confidence level, it is not a significant improvement over previous iterations.

**3. Train Lift**

- **Current Value:** 1.2463
- **Previous Values:** 1.2048, 1.0559

The train lift has increased slightly, reaching **1.2463** compared to previous values of **1.2048** and **1.0559**. A lift greater than **1** implies that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. The increase suggests a stronger association between the rule conditions and the **high yield** outcome.

**4. Train Leverage**

- **Current Value:** 0.0050
- **Previous Values:** 0.0289, -0.0041

The train leverage has decreased compared to the highest previous value but is an improvement over the negative leverage. A positive leverage indicates that the rule is identifying associations that occur more frequently than expected by chance; however, the small value suggests the association is weak.

---

**Interpretation of Metrics**

- **Support Decrease:** The substantial drop in support signifies that the new rules are too narrowly defined, applying to only a small fraction of the dataset. This limits the practical usefulness of the rules and suggests potential overfitting to specific instances in the training data.

- **Confidence Stability:** The confidence level has not improved significantly, indicating that the predictive accuracy of the rules when they apply remains similar to previous iterations.

- **Lift Increase:** A modest increase in lift shows a slightly better association strength between the rule conditions and the outcome, but the improvement may not justify the loss in support.

- **Leverage Analysis:** The low positive leverage implies that the rules are only marginally better at predicting the outcome than would be expected by random chance, given their low support.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

The current iteration appears to have reached a local minimum where further specificity in the rules is not yielding proportional gains in confidence or lift. The decrease in support without significant improvements in other metrics suggests diminishing returns from continuing in the current direction.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

1. **Broaden Rule Conditions:**

   - **Objective:** Increase support by making the rules applicable to a larger subset of the data.
   - **Action:** Relax overly strict conditions in the rules. For example, combine similar functional groups or structural motifs that have comparable effects on yield.

2. **Optimize Confidence and Support Balance:**

   - **Objective:** Achieve a better balance between confidence and support to enhance both the reliability and applicability of the rules.
   - **Action:** Re-evaluate the trade-offs between specificity and generality, perhaps accepting slightly lower confidence for a significant gain in support.

3. **Merge Similar Rules:**

   - **Objective:** Simplify the rule set and prevent fragmentation of data across too many specific rules.
   - **Action:** Identify rules that predict the same outcome and have overlapping conditions, and merge them to create more robust, generalized rules.

4. **Feature Importance Analysis:**

   - **Objective:** Focus on the most influential molecular features affecting the catalytic yield.
   - **Action:** Use statistical techniques or machine learning models to determine which structural features contribute most to high yields and prioritize them in rule development.

5. **Incorporate Test Metrics:**

   - **Objective:** Ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data and are not overfitting the training set.
   - **Action:** Evaluate the rules on test data to assess their performance outside the training set, especially focusing on confidence and lift in the test metrics.

6. **Consult Domain Expertise:**

   - **Objective:** Leverage chemical intuition to refine rules based on known catalytic mechanisms and interactions.
   - **Action:** Work with chemists to understand why certain functional groups or structures lead to high or low yields and adjust rules accordingly.

7. **Iterative Refinement with Wider Net:**

   - **Objective:** Capture a broader range of effective modifiers without sacrificing too much specificity.
   - **Action:** Introduce new rules that encompass additional functional groups or structural variations known to influence yield positively.

8. **Analyze Outliers and Exceptions:**

   - **Objective:** Understand cases where the rules fail to predict correctly to improve rule accuracy.
   - **Action:** Investigate compounds that do not conform to the current rules despite having expected features, and adapt the rules to account for these anomalies.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules, while maintaining a reasonable confidence level and slightly improved lift, suffers from overly low support, indicating over-specialization. To enhance the performance of the rules, it is crucial to increase their applicability by generalizing some of the conditions, thereby covering a larger portion of the dataset. Balancing support and confidence is essential to develop robust rules that are both reliable and widely applicable.

By broadening the rules and integrating domain knowledge, we can achieve a more effective rule set that not only identifies key factors leading to high catalytic yields but also generalizes well to new data, thereby providing valuable insights for the research program.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

The current classification model achieved a validation accuracy of **68.57%**, which is notably lower than the previous validation accuracies of **76%** and test accuracies ranging from **62.5%** to **75%**. This decrease in accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be effectively capturing the underlying patterns in the data as compared to previous iterations. The reduction in performance could be indicative of several issues:

1. **Underfitting**: The model may be too simple or the rules too general, failing to capture the complexity of the data, leading to poor performance on both the training and validation sets.

2. **Overfitting**: Alternatively, the model might be overfitting to specific patterns in the training data that do not generalize well to the validation set. This can occur if the rules are too specific or if irrelevant features are included.

3. **Rule Effectiveness**: The current rules may not be as effective in distinguishing between modifiers that lead to high or low catalyst loading, impacting the model's predictive capability.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into how each feature (in this case, each rule) contributes to the model's predictions. By analyzing the SHAP values for instances where the model's predictions do not align with the experimental values, we can identify which rules may be contributing to misclassifications.

     - **Rule 12**: 0.0082
     - **Rule 13**: 0.0463

7. **Molecule**: *C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O*
   - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule 5**: 0.0488
     - **Rule 12**: 0.0728
     - **Rule 13**: 0.0245

8. **Molecule**: *C(COCCOCCN)C(=O)O*
   - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule 5**: 0.0488
     - **Rule 12**: 0.0728
     - **Rule 13**: 0.0245

In these cases, the model predicts a high loading, whereas the experimental results show low loading. The rules contributing most significantly (with high positive SHAP values) are **Rule 5**, **Rule 12**, and **Rule 13**.

**Underestimations (Predicted Low Loading, Experimental High Loading):**

1. **Molecule**: *C1=CC(=CC=C1CCCCC(=O)O)O*
   - **Rules with High Negative SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule 12**: -0.5699

Here, the model predicts a low loading, but the experimental value is high. The rule contributing most significantly to this misclassification (with a high negative SHAP value) is **Rule 12**.

**Insights:**

- **Rule 5** consistently shows high positive SHAP values in overestimations, suggesting that it may be overemphasizing its contribution to predicting high loading in cases where the experimental loading is actually low.

- **Rule 12** shows high positive SHAP values in overestimations and a high negative SHAP value in underestimations, indicating that it may be incorrectly influencing the model's predictions in both directions.

- **Rule 13** also contributes to overestimations with high positive SHAP values, though its impact appears slightly less than that of Rules 5 and 12.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made to improve the current rules:

1. **Refine Rule 5**:

   - **Current Rule**: Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in **low yield**.
   - **Issue Identified**: Rule 5 is contributing positively to predicting high loading, even though it is supposed to be associated with low yield. This contradiction suggests that the rule may be incorrectly formulated or implemented in the feature matrix.
   - **Proposed Action**:
     - **Review the Implementation**: Ensure that the feature extraction correctly identifies perfluoroalkyl groups and assigns the appropriate feature value.
     - **Refine the Rule**: Consider specifying the chain length and position of fluorine atoms, as not all perfluoroalkyl modifiers may lead to low yield.
     - **Update the Rule**: Adjust Rule 5 to more accurately reflect the modifiers that truly lead to low yield, possibly by incorporating additional structural considerations.

2. **Adjust Rule 12**:

   - **Current Rule**: Modifiers with aromatic rings bearing hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position can have variable effects.
   - **Issue Identified**: Rule 12 is contributing to both overestimations and underestimations, indicating inconsistency in its predictive ability.
   - **Proposed Action**:
     - **Split the Rule**: Separate Rule 12 into two distinct rules to account for the differing effects of para-hydroxyl and para-amino groups.
       - **New Rule 12A**: Modifiers with para-amino groups on aromatic rings lead to **high yield**.
       - **New Rule 12B**: Modifiers with para-hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings tend to result in **low yield**.
     - **Clarify the Conditions**: Provide more precise definitions and conditions under which each sub-rule applies.
     - **Re-evaluate the Rule's Weight**: Adjust the importance given to Rule 12 in the model based on its refined definition.

3. **Revisit Rule 13**:

   - **Current Rule**: Omega-amino carboxylic acids with a chain length of five carbons result in **high yield**, while longer chains result in **low yield**.
   - **Issue Identified**: Rule 13 is contributing to overestimations, suggesting that it may be too general or not accounting for other structural factors.
   - **Proposed Action**:
     - **Consider Chain Length Variability**: Investigate whether the optimal chain length is indeed five carbons or if a range (e.g., four to six carbons) is more appropriate.
     - **Account for Substituents**: Include considerations for additional functional groups that may impact the modifier's effectiveness.
     - **Update the Rule**: Refine Rule 13 to specify the conditions under which omega-amino carboxylic acids lead to high or low yield, possibly incorporating steric or electronic effects.

4. **Improve Generalization and Address Overfitting/Underfitting**:

   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: Rules that are too complex or encompass too many conditions may cause overfitting. Simplify rules where possible without losing essential predictive power.
   - **Eliminate Redundant Rules**: Identify and remove rules that may be redundant or overlapping in their predictive contributions.
   - **Incorporate More Data**: If possible, expand the dataset to include more examples, which can help the model learn more generalizable patterns.
   - **Regularization Techniques**: Apply regularization methods in the model to prevent overfitting, such as penalizing overly complex models.

5. **Utilize SHAP Analysis for Continuous Improvement**:

   - **Iterative Refinement**: Continue using SHAP values to identify which rules positively or negatively impact the model's predictions and adjust accordingly.
   - **Feature Importance Ranking**: Use SHAP values to rank the importance of each rule, focusing refinement efforts on the most impactful ones.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Employ cross-validation techniques to ensure that rule adjustments lead to consistent improvements across different subsets of the data.

**Conclusion**

By closely examining the accuracies and SHAP values, it becomes evident that certain rules, specifically **Rule 5**, **Rule 12**, and **Rule 13**, are contributing to misclassifications in the current model. Refining these rules to more accurately capture the relationship between modifier structure and catalyst loading will likely improve the model's performance.

Adjustments should focus on:

- **Clarifying and simplifying rules** to reduce overfitting.
- **Specifying conditions** under which rules apply to improve predictive accuracy.
- **Using SHAP analysis** as a guiding tool for iterative improvement.

Implementing these recommendations should help enhance the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen molecules, ultimately leading to better predictions of catalyst loading based on modifier structures.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Rule Optimization**

The current analysis of the rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has highlighted several areas for improvement. The key points from the discussions are as follows:

1. **Low Train Support**: The train support has decreased significantly to 1.9%, indicating that the current rules apply to a very small portion of the dataset. This suggests that the rules are overly specific and may not generalize well.

2. **Stable Train Confidence with Slight Increase in Lift**: While the train confidence remains around 61.7%, the slight increase in lift to 1.2463 shows a marginal improvement in the association strength between the rule conditions and the high-yield outcome.

3. **Model Performance Issues**: The validation accuracy has decreased to 68.57%, and SHAP analysis reveals that certain rules are contributing to misclassifications, particularly Rules 5, 12, and 13.

4. **Rule Implementation Flaws**: There are implementation issues such as incorrect handling of count thresholds, logical 'OR' conditions, positional specificity in SMARTS patterns, and processing of excluded patterns.

5. **Overfitting and Underfitting Concerns**: The low support and reduced accuracy suggest that the current rules may be overfitting to specific instances or underfitting by failing to capture the complexity of the data.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

To optimize the current rules and enhance the predictive performance of the model, the following suggestions are recommended:

1. **Correct Implementation of Count Thresholds**

   - **Issue**: The count thresholds for functional groups are not correctly applied due to mismatches in the SMARTS pattern keys.
   - **Action**: Use the original SMARTS pattern strings as keys in the `count_threshold` dictionary or store the compiled pattern objects as keys. Ensure that the pattern matching in the code correctly references these keys when applying thresholds.

2. **Implement Logical 'OR' Conditions in Rules**

   - **Issue**: Rules that require any one of multiple functional groups (e.g., Rule 2) are incorrectly implemented as needing all patterns to match.
   - **Action**: Introduce an `any_patterns` key in the rule definitions to specify patterns where a match with any one suffices. Modify the code logic to handle these 'OR' conditions appropriately.

3. **Specify Positional Constraints in SMARTS Patterns**

   - **Issue**: Rules involving positional specificity (e.g., substituents at the para position) lack accurate representation in the SMARTS patterns.
   - **Action**: Define SMARTS patterns that include positional constraints to capture the exact structural requirements of the rules.

4. **Combine Patterns for Specific Structural Contexts**

   - **Issue**: Separate patterns may not effectively capture complex structural features.
   - **Action**: Combine patterns into single SMARTS expressions that represent the specific structural context, ensuring that the patterns match only when all conditions are met.

5. **Review and Refine Problematic Rules**

   - **Rule 5**:
     - **Issue**: Although intended to predict low yield, Rule 5 is contributing to high predictions.
     - **Action**: Re-express the rule to accurately identify modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups leading to low yield. Ensure that the pattern correctly captures the presence of perfluoroalkyl groups attached directly to the carboxylic acid.

   - **Rule 12**:
     - **Issue**: Rule 12 is inconsistent, contributing to both overestimations and underestimations.
     - **Action**: Split Rule 12 into two separate rules to distinguish between para-amino and para-hydroxyl groups. Clearly define the conditions under which each substituent affects the yield.

   - **Rule 13**:
     - **Issue**: The rule may be too general regarding chain length and functional group effects.
     - **Action**: Refine the rule to specify optimal chain lengths and consider additional functional groups that may influence yield.

6. **Ensure Accurate Processing of Excluded Patterns**

   - **Issue**: The code may not correctly exclude molecules that match the `exclude_patterns`.
   - **Action**: Adjust the exclusion logic so that matching an excluded pattern sets `match` to `False` immediately, preventing false positives.

7. **Adjust Logic for Independent Pattern Matches**

   - **Issue**: Some rules require that any one of several patterns should trigger a match, but the code may require all patterns to match.
   - **Action**: Modify the code to allow patterns within `any_patterns` to independently trigger a match, reflecting logical 'OR' conditions.

8. **Broaden Rule Conditions to Increase Support**

   - **Issue**: Overly specific rules lead to low support.
   - **Action**: Generalize rules where appropriate to apply to a larger portion of the dataset, balancing specificity with applicability.

9. **Incorporate Domain Expertise**

   - **Issue**: Certain structural features impacting yield may be overlooked.
   - **Action**: Collaborate with chemists to understand mechanistic insights and integrate this knowledge into the rule definitions.

10. **Use More Specific SMARTS Patterns for Complex Rules**

    - **Issue**: Complex structural requirements are not adequately captured.
    - **Action**: Develop precise SMARTS patterns that account for linker lengths, substituent positions, and electronic effects.

11. **Validate SMARTS Patterns**

    - **Issue**: Potential mismatches between patterns and intended structures.
    - **Action**: Test each pattern against known examples to ensure accurate matching and adjust patterns as necessary.

12. **Add Comments and Documentation**

    - **Issue**: Complex code may be difficult to maintain.
    - **Action**: Include detailed comments explaining the purpose and logic of each code section and pattern.

13. **Analyze Outliers and Exceptions**

    - **Issue**: Misclassifications may reveal weaknesses in the rules.
    - **Action**: Investigate molecules where predictions do not match experimental values and adjust rules to account for these cases.

14. **Regularization and Model Complexity**

    - **Issue**: Overfitting may occur due to overly complex rules.
    - **Action**: Simplify rules where possible and consider applying regularization techniques in the model to prevent overfitting.

15. **Iterative Testing and Refinement**

    - **Issue**: Single adjustments may not lead to significant improvements.
    - **Action**: Iteratively test the impact of each change on model performance and continue refining the rules based on feedback from metrics and SHAP analysis.

**Judgment on Further Optimization**

Based on the analysis, there is clear potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. Adjusting the rule implementations, refining specific rules, and enhancing the code logic are likely to improve both the applicability and accuracy of the rules.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**—specifically, those containing an additional carboxylic acid group—such as **aspartic acid** ((2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) and **glutamic acid** ((2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid), lead to **high yield**.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as nitro (-NO₂) or bromomethyl (-CH₂Br) substituents, result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles**, such as pyridine or pyrazole rings, are associated with **high yield**. Examples are **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched chains and no polar substituents** (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups), such as **octanoic acid**, lead to **high yield**. In contrast, similar aliphatic acids with polar substituents on the chain, especially at terminal positions, result in **low yield**. Examples of low-yield modifiers are **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid**, such as **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, result in **low yield** due to the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms affecting catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain**, like **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), lead to **high yield** by enhancing solubility and catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) functional groups** tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, where these groups may deactivate the catalyst or interfere with the reaction pathway.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups on aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**, as seen with **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, due to potential coordination with metal centers. Conversely, **modifiers with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings**, like **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**, possibly due to steric hindrance or deactivation of the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with uncharged polar side chains or basic side chains**, such as derivatives of serine, threonine, or lysine (e.g., **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**), tend to result in **low yield**. The presence of additional amino groups may lead to catalyst poisoning or side reactions.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with bulky side chains**, like **tryptophan** ((2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid), lead to **high yield**, possibly due to π-π interactions facilitating catalyst activity. In contrast, **modifiers with less bulky aromatic side chains**, such as **phenylalanine** ((2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid), result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that include amide linkages involving aromatic rings and aliphatic chains** tend to result in **low yield**. Examples are **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, where the amide bond may hinder effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings bearing hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position** can have variable effects. **Modifiers like 4-aminobenzoic acid**, with a para-amino group, lead to **high yield**, possibly due to favorable electronic effects. However, **derivatives of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid**, such as **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, tend to result in **low yield**, indicating that para-hydroxyl groups may negatively impact the reaction.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino carboxylic acids with a chain length of five carbons**, such as **5-aminopentanoic acid**, result in **high yield**, potentially due to optimal chain length for catalyst interaction. **Longer chain omega-amino acids**, like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, result in **low yield**, possibly because longer chains reduce the compound's ability to effectively interact with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially those containing polyether chains like triethylene glycol units, result in **low yield**. An example is **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, where the ether chains may sterically hinder catalyst access or alter solubility.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents connected via flexible aliphatic linkers**, where the linker is sufficiently long, can lead to **high yield**. For instance, **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (with a five-carbon linker) results in **high yield**, whereas **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (with a three-carbon linker) results in **low yield**, suggesting that longer linkers favor better catalyst interaction.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Correct the Implementation of Count Thresholds**
  
  Ensure that the keys in the `count_threshold` dictionary exactly match the SMARTS patterns used in the code. Use the original SMARTS pattern strings as keys or store the compiled SMARTS pattern objects as keys. This will enable accurate counting of functional groups and proper application of threshold conditions in the rules.

- **Advice 2**: **Implement Logical 'OR' Conditions Using `any_patterns`**

  Introduce an `any_patterns` key in the rule definitions to represent logical 'OR' conditions where matching any one of multiple patterns satisfies the rule. Modify the code logic to check for matches against all patterns in `any_patterns` and set `match = True` if any pattern matches. This is essential for rules like Rule 2, where the presence of any one of several electron-withdrawing groups results in a high yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Specify Positional Constraints in SMARTS Patterns**

  Define SMARTS patterns that include positional information to capture substituents at specific positions on aromatic rings. For example, to detect para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids, use SMARTS patterns that specify the substituent position relative to the carboxylic acid group. This will improve the accuracy of rules dependent on substituent positions, such as Rules 2 and 12.

- **Advice 4**: **Combine Patterns for Complex Structural Requirements**

  For rules that require multiple structural features to be present simultaneously, combine the individual patterns into a single SMARTS pattern. This ensures that the pattern matches only when all specified features are present in the correct context. For instance, combine patterns for an aromatic ring, a carboxylic acid group, and a para-electron-withdrawing group into one pattern for Rule 2.

- **Advice 5**: **Refine Problematic Rules**

  - **Rule 5**:
    - **Action**: Revise the SMARTS pattern to accurately identify modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid. Ensure that the pattern captures the perfluoroalkyl chain and its attachment to the carboxylic acid, reflecting the electron-withdrawing effect that leads to low yield.
  - **Rule 12**:
    - **Action**: Split Rule 12 into two separate rules. One for modifiers with para-amino groups (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid) leading to high yield, and another for modifiers with para-hydroxyl groups (e.g., derivatives of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid) leading to low yield. Define specific SMARTS patterns for each case to accurately capture their distinct effects on yield.
  - **Rule 13**:
    - **Action**: Refine Rule 13 by specifying the optimal chain length for omega-amino carboxylic acids that lead to high yield (e.g., five-carbon chains like 5-aminopentanoic acid). Adjust the rule to account for the decreased yield associated with longer chains (e.g., seven or eight carbons) and consider the influence of additional functional groups.

- **Advice 6**: **Ensure Accurate Processing of Excluded Patterns**

  Adjust the exclusion logic in the code so that if a molecule matches any pattern in the `exclude_patterns` list, it immediately sets `match = False` and skips further evaluation of that rule. This prevents false positives where excluded features are present but not properly accounted for.

- **Advice 7**: **Allow Independent Pattern Matches in `any_patterns`**

  Modify the code logic so that patterns within `any_patterns` are evaluated independently. If any one of these patterns matches, the rule should trigger a match. This adjustment accurately reflects logical 'OR' conditions and ensures that modifiers meeting any of the specified criteria are correctly identified.

- **Advice 8**: **Broaden Rule Conditions to Increase Train Support**

  Review and generalize overly specific rules to apply to a broader range of modifiers without sacrificing prediction accuracy. For example, consider combining similar rules or expanding the functional group criteria to include a wider variety of substituents that exhibit similar electronic or steric effects on the reaction.

- **Advice 9**: **Validate and Refine SMARTS Patterns**

  Test each SMARTS pattern against known compounds in the dataset to ensure accurate matching. Use cheminformatics tools or software to visualize pattern matches and adjust the patterns as necessary. This validation will help identify any discrepancies between the intended structural features and the actual matches.

- **Advice 10**: **Incorporate Domain Expertise and Mechanistic Insights**

  Collaborate with chemists to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism and how different modifiers influence the yield. Use this knowledge to refine the rules, focusing on the mechanistic rationale behind each rule. For example, consider the electronic effects, steric hindrance, and coordination abilities of functional groups.

- **Advice 11**: **Add Comments and Documentation**

  Include detailed comments in the code and rule definitions to explain the purpose, logic, and specific conditions of each rule. Document the reasoning behind SMARTS patterns and any assumptions made. This will facilitate future modifications and help other team members understand the codebase.

- **Advice 12**: **Analyze Misclassifications and Adjust Rules Accordingly**

  Examine the compounds that are incorrectly predicted by the current rules. Identify any common structural features or patterns among these misclassified compounds. Use this analysis to adjust existing rules or develop new rules that account for these features, improving overall model accuracy.

- **Advice 13**: **Simplify Overly Complex Rules to Prevent Overfitting**

  Review rules that may be too complex or specific, leading to overfitting. Simplify these rules by focusing on the most significant structural features that impact yield. Avoid rules that rely on rare or unique features unless strongly justified by experimental evidence.

- **Advice 14**: **Iteratively Test and Refine the Rules**

  After implementing the suggested changes, reevaluate the model's performance using the training and validation datasets. Use performance metrics and SHAP analysis to assess the impact of each modification. Continue refining the rules iteratively based on these assessments until satisfactory performance is achieved.

- **Advice 15**: **Ensure Logical Consistency in Rule Implementation**

  Review the overall code logic to confirm that it correctly reflects the intended behavior of each rule. Check that the inclusion and exclusion of patterns are handled appropriately, and that the order of evaluation does not introduce unintended biases or conflicts between rules.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* states that modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid, especially those with polyether chains like triethylene glycol units, result in low yield (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**). While the rule is clear and provides chemical insight into the effect of ether linkages, it has limited coverage with only one supporting data point. This reduces its overall score in terms of coverage, but it still meets the other criteria.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* indicates that modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**). The rule is clear and suggests that perfluoroalkyl groups negatively affect the reaction. However, the coverage is limited due to a single data point, which lowers its score in that criterion.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* mentions that omega-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer (e.g., **5-aminopentanoic acid**) result in high yield, while longer chains like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** lead to low yield. The rule is clear, provides insight into the effect of chain length on reactivity, considers structural variations, and is supported by multiple data points. Rule 10 satisfies all criteria effectively.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* states that para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids bearing amino groups lead to high yield (e.g., **4-aminobenzoic acid**), whereas those with para-hydroxyl groups like **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** result in low yield. The rule is clear, offers chemical insight into how different substituents affect the reaction, considers specific structural combinations, and is backed by data. Rule 11 meets all the criteria well.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* highlights that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on aliphatic chains, such as **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), lead to high yield. While the rule is clear and provides insight into the role of hydroxyl groups in enhancing solubility and catalyst interaction, it is based on a single data point, which limits its coverage. Therefore, Rule 12 partially meets the criteria.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**—specifically, those containing an additional carboxylic acid group—lead to **high yield**. Examples include **aspartic acid** ((2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) and **glutamic acid** ((2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid).

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as nitro (-NO₂) or bromomethyl (-CH₂Br) substituents, result in **high yield**. Examples are **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles**, such as pyridine or pyrazole rings, are associated with **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched alkyl chains of five carbons or more and no polar functional groups** (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups) result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. In contrast, similar aliphatic acids with polar substituents, especially terminal hydroxyl or amino groups, result in **low yield**. Examples of low-yield modifiers are **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains**, particularly **tryptophan**, lead to **high yield**. In contrast, modifiers with less bulky aromatic side chains, like **phenylalanine**, result in **low yield**. Examples are **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) and **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups attached to aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. Conversely, modifiers with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings, like **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) functional groups** tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially those containing polyether chains like triethylene glycol units, result in **low yield**. An example is **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids (with amino groups at the terminal position) with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer**, such as **5-aminopentanoic acid**, result in **high yield**. Longer chain omega-amino acids, like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, lead to **low yield**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids bearing amino groups** lead to **high yield**. An example is **4-aminobenzoic acid**. However, similar modifiers with para-hydroxyl groups, like **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on aliphatic chains**, such as **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), lead to **high yield**. The hydroxyl groups may enhance solubility and improve interactions with the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 4**, modify the SMARTS pattern to detect unbranched alkyl chains of five **or more** carbons ending with a carboxylic acid. The current pattern `'[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` only matches chains with exactly five carbons. Replace it with a pattern that specifies **at least** five contiguous `[CH2]` units before the carboxylic acid. For example, use `'[CH2]([CH2]){4,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`, where `{4,}` indicates four or more repetitions of `[CH2]`, resulting in chains of five or more carbons.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For **Rule 4**, ensure that exclude patterns effectively block molecules with polar functional groups. Double-check the exclude patterns to confirm they cover all possible polar groups, and adjust them if necessary to prevent unintended matches.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 5**, update the SMARTS pattern for the **indole ring** to be more general and match tryptophan. The current pattern `'c1cc2c(cc1)[nH]c2'` may be too specific or incorrectly specified. Use a more general pattern like `'c1c(cccc1)[nH]'` or `'[nH]1c2cccc2cc1'` to accurately detect the indole ring in different orientations and protonation states.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For **Rule 5**, verify that the code correctly identifies the **primary amine** and **carboxylic acid** groups in amino acids. Ensure that the SMARTS patterns `'[NX3;H2]'` and `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` are accurately matching these functional groups in all amino acids, including those like tryptophan.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For **Rule 5**, distinguish between tryptophan and phenylalanine by adding an **exclude pattern** for phenylalanine or creating a separate rule for low-yield modifiers with less bulky aromatic side chains. For instance, you can include an exclude pattern like `'c1ccccc1'` to exclude simple phenyl rings from matching Rule 5.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For **Rule 5**, consider adding a **count_threshold** for the indole pattern to ensure the molecule contains at least one indole ring. This can help prevent false negatives due to substructure matching issues.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For all rules, review and test the SMARTS patterns using a chemical drawing tool or an RDKit-based script to ensure they match the intended structures. This helps verify that the patterns are correctly specified and functional.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Implement **unit tests** for each rule with known positive and negative examples to validate that the code correctly identifies matches and non-matches. This will help in catching issues early and ensuring the reliability of the feature matrix generation.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify Rules to Quantifiable Features**  
  Modify the current rules to focus on molecular features that can be directly quantified from SMILES strings. For example, instead of describing complex functional groups qualitatively, specify the exact substructures or functional groups (e.g., count of carboxylic acid groups, presence of amino groups, chain length) that can be numerically counted or identified in the SMILES notation.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints**  
  Generate a set of molecular descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, LogP, topological polar surface area, number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors) and chemical fingerprints (e.g., Morgan fingerprints) from the SMILES of the modifiers. These descriptors can form a numeric feature matrix that correlates with the reaction yield and can aid in creating more precise rules.

- **Advice 3**: **Generalize and Consolidate Existing Rules**  
  Refine the existing rules to be more general and less overlapping. For example, combine rules that describe similar features (e.g., modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups) and specify the exact positions and types of substituents that influence the yield. This will reduce redundancy and enhance the clarity of the rules.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR)**  
  Apply QSAR modeling to identify which structural features most significantly impact the yield. Use statistical analysis to correlate specific molecular properties extracted from SMILES with the reaction outcomes, and update the rules to reflect these quantitative relationships.

- **Advice 5**: **Create Binary Features for Functional Groups**  
  Generate binary features indicating the presence or absence of specific functional groups or substructures within the modifiers. For instance, create features for "has_carboxylic_acid", "has_amino_group", "has_alkyl_chain_length_>=5", which can directly be derived from the SMILES and used in modeling.

- **Advice 6**: **Focus on Easily Computable Structural Features**  
  Emphasize rules based on structural features that are straightforward to compute from SMILES, such as ring counts, heteroatom counts, or the presence of particular substructures like pyridine rings or thiol groups. This approach enhances the practicality of applying the rules to new compounds.

- **Advice 7**: **Implement Rule-Based Substructure Searching**  
  Use substructure searching algorithms on SMILES strings to identify key motifs associated with high or low yield. Develop rules that specify these substructures explicitly, allowing for automated detection and feature generation.

- **Advice 8**: **Employ Machine Learning for Feature Importance**  
  Train machine learning models using the computed features to identify which molecular descriptors are most predictive of yield. Use the feature importance rankings from these models to inform the creation of new rules or the refinement of existing ones.

- **Advice 9**: **Ensure Mutual Exclusivity and Coverage**  
  Revise the rules to be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive where possible. This helps in creating a clear mapping from modifiers to expected yields and simplifies the feature generation process by avoiding overlapping conditions.

- **Advice 10**: **Integrate Negative Rules Explicitly**  
  Include rules that specify structures leading to low yield, not just those leading to high yield. Explicitly defining negative rules enhances the predictive power of the rule set and helps in distinguishing between high and low yield modifiers based on quantifiable features.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**—specifically, those containing an additional carboxylic acid group—lead to **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer**, such as **5-aminopentanoic acid**, result in **high yield**. In contrast, longer-chain omega-amino acids, like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, lead to **low yield**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of eight carbons and no additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. Conversely, similar aliphatic acids with polar substituents—especially terminal hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH₂) groups—result in **low yield**. Examples of low-yield modifiers are **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as nitro (-NO₂) or bromomethyl (-CH₂Br) substituents, lead to **high yield**. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids bearing amino (-NH₂) groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **4-aminobenzoic acid**. In contrast, similar modifiers with para-methyl (-CH₃) groups, like **4-methylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield** due to the electron-donating nature of the methyl group, which may reduce catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring**, such as pyridine or pyrazole carboxylic acids directly attached to the carboxyl group, are associated with **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. However, modifiers where the nitrogen-containing heterocycle is a substituent on an aromatic ring, like **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups attached to aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. Conversely, modifiers with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**, possibly due to steric hindrance or electronic effects affecting catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic aromatic side chains**, particularly **tryptophan**, lead to **high yield**. This may be due to π-π stacking interactions facilitating catalyst activity. In contrast, modifiers with less bulky aromatic side chains, like **phenylalanine**, result in **low yield**. Examples are **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) for high yield and **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine) for low yield.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl or trifluoromethyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorinated groups may hinder effective catalyst coordination.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially those containing polyether chains like triethylene glycol units, result in **low yield**. Examples are **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. The ether groups may increase steric bulk or alter solubility in a way that negatively affects the reaction.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (-OH) groups separated from the carboxylic acid by an aliphatic linker** lead to **high yield**. An example is **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**. In contrast, similar compounds where the hydroxyl group is directly attached to the aromatic ring without an aliphatic linker, like **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on aliphatic chains attached to the carboxylic acid** lead to **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).

** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Molecular Descriptors for Modifiers**  
  To facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix, assign quantitative molecular descriptors to each modifier. This includes calculating properties such as molecular weight, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and counts of specific functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amines, hydroxyls). By converting the structural features into numerical values, you can create a standardized dataset suitable for statistical analysis or machine learning models.

- **Advice 2**: **Incorporate Electronic and Steric Parameters**  
  Replace qualitative terms like "electron-withdrawing groups" or "bulky side chains" with quantitative electronic and steric parameters. Use Hammett sigma constants to represent electronic effects of substituents and Taft steric parameters for steric hindrance. This allows for a precise numerical representation of these effects, enabling better correlation with reaction yields.

- **Advice 3**: **Standardize Functional Group Positioning**  
  Encode the position of functional groups numerically relative to the carboxylic acid group. For aromatic modifiers, indicate the substitution pattern using numerical codes (e.g., ortho = 1, meta = 2, para = 3). For aliphatic chains, include the carbon atom number where substituents are attached. This standardization aids in feature matrix generation and captures the influence of functional group positioning on yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Classify Modifiers Using Hierarchical Clustering**  
  Utilize hierarchical clustering algorithms on the quantitative descriptors to group similar modifiers. This can reveal underlying patterns and simplify the rules by focusing on clusters with high or low yields. The classified groups can then be used to refine existing rules or create new ones that are easier to apply and analyze.

- **Advice 5**: **Develop Generalized Rules Based on Descriptor Thresholds**  
  Formulate new rules by identifying threshold values of descriptors that correlate with high or low yields. For example, "Modifiers with logP greater than X yield high reaction efficiency" or "Modifiers with TPSA less than Y result in low yield." These rules are directly based on numerical values, making them practical for computational analysis.

- **Advice 6**: **Implement Machine Learning Models for Rule Generation**  
  Use the numeric feature matrix to train machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to predict yields and extract important features automatically. The models can help identify complex nonlinear relationships between modifier structures and reaction outcomes, leading to more accurate and practical rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Eliminate Redundant or Conflicting Rules**  
  Review the current set of rules to identify and remove redundancy or contradictions. Overlapping rules can cause confusion and hinder the creation of a clear numeric feature matrix. Streamlining the rules ensures that each one contributes uniquely to understanding the reaction yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Prioritize Easily Computable Features**  
  Focus on features that can be easily computed from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools. This includes counts of atoms, bonds, ring systems, and the presence of specific substructures. By prioritizing these features, you simplify data extraction and minimize computational overhead.

- **Advice 9**: **Include 3D Structural Descriptors if Relevant**  
  If stereochemistry or 3D conformation of modifiers affects the yield, consider including 3D descriptors like molecular volume, solvent-accessible surface area, or conformational energies. These can be calculated using molecular modeling software and may provide additional insights into steric effects.

- **Advice 10**: **Integrate Solubility and Stability Factors**  
  Since reaction medium interactions can influence the yield, incorporate descriptors related to solubility (e.g., aqueous solubility estimates) and chemical stability. Modifiers that are poorly soluble or unstable under reaction conditions might lead to lower yields, and quantifying these factors can improve the rules.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**, specifically those containing an additional carboxylic acid group beyond the alpha-carboxyl (e.g., aspartic acid and glutamic acid), lead to **high yield**. Examples: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer**, such as **5-aminopentanoic acid**, result in **high yield**. In contrast, longer-chain omega-amino acids with more than five carbons, like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, lead to **low yield**.

- **Rule 3**: **Unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of eight carbons and no additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. Conversely, similar aliphatic acids with polar substituents—especially terminal hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH₂) groups—result in **low yield**. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 4**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as nitro (-NO₂) or bromomethyl (-CH₂Br) substituents, lead to **high yield**. Examples are **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. In contrast, similar compounds with electron-donating groups at the para position, like methyl (-CH₃) in **4-methylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-amino (-NH₂) groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **4-aminobenzoic acid**. The amino group may facilitate better coordination with the catalyst, enhancing the reaction efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: **Heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the nitrogen atom is part of the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. However, when the nitrogen-containing heterocycle is attached via an additional aromatic ring, as in **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, the yield is **low**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with terminal thiol (-SH) groups attached to aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. Conversely, modifiers with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic aromatic side chains**, particularly **tryptophan**, lead to **high yield**. This may be due to π-π stacking interactions facilitating catalyst activity. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan). In contrast, amino acids with less bulky aromatic side chains, like **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may hinder effective coordination with the catalytic sites.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially those containing polyether chains like triethylene glycol units, result in **low yield**. Examples are **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. The ether chains may introduce steric hindrance or alter the solubility profile, negatively affecting catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the carbon chain** lead to **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). The multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance binding affinity to the catalyst through hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (-OH) groups separated from the carboxylic acid by an aliphatic linker** lead to **high yield**. An example is **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**. In contrast, similar compounds where the hydroxyl group is directly attached to the aromatic ring without an aliphatic linker, like **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds**, particularly those formed by acylation of amino acids or linking amino acid residues, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**. The presence of amide bonds may interfere with optimal catalyst coordination due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons on the nitrogen.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (-CHO) functional groups attached to an aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. An example is **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**. Aldehyde groups may participate in side reactions or deactivate catalytic sites.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to an aromatic ring within a lactone or ketone structure** lead to **high yield**. An example is **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**. The carbonyl groups may facilitate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Modify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1**. The current pattern for `alpha_amino_acid` excludes amino acids with side chains that are carboxylic acids due to the negative lookahead `-[*!$([CX3](=O)[OX1H])]`. This exclusion prevents matching aspartic acid and glutamic acid, which have carboxylic acid groups in their side chains. To fix this, remove the negative lookahead and instead ensure that the molecule contains at least two carboxylic acid groups. Update the `alpha_amino_acid` pattern to `'[NX3H2]-[CX4H](-[CX3](=O)[OX1H])-[*]'` and adjust `min_count` to `[1, 2]` for carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Adjust the chain length logic in Rule 2**. The current pattern for omega-amino acids with chain lengths ≤5 carbons matches only 5-carbon chains. Modify the pattern to allow for chains of 2 to 5 carbons using a recursive SMARTS pattern. For example, use `'[NX3H2]-[CX4]-[CX4]{0,3}-[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` to match chains with 0 to 3 additional carbons between the amino group and the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Correct the patterns for longer chain omega-amino acids in Rule 2.1**. The current pattern matches only 6-carbon chains. Modify the pattern to match chains longer than 5 carbons using `'[NX3H2]-[CX4]-[CX4]{4,}-[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`, which matches chains with 4 or more additional carbons (total chain length >5).

- **Suggestion 4**: **Revise the pattern for Rule 3** to ensure it accurately matches unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with an eight-carbon chain and no additional functional groups. Use a more general pattern like `'CCCCCCCC[C](=O)O'` or `'[CX4]1CCCCCCC1[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` and ensure there are no other functional groups by checking for the absence of heteroatoms other than the terminal carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Improve the patterns for polar substituents in Rule 3.1**. Currently, the patterns for terminal -OH and -NH₂ groups may not capture all relevant molecules. Use SMARTS patterns like `'[OX2H][CX4]-[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` for terminal hydroxyl groups and `'[NX3H2][CX4]-[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` for terminal amino groups, ensuring they are at the end of the chain.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Refine the patterns for electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups in Rule 4**. The current patterns may be too specific. Use a general pattern for para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids: `'c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`. Then, define subpatterns for electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro `'[NX3+(=O)[O-]]'`, halogens `'[F,Cl,Br,I]'`) and electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl `'[CH3]'`, methoxy `'[OCH3]'`) at the para position using SMARTS with position constraints.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Update the pattern for heteroaromatic rings in Rule 6**. The current pattern `'[n][c][c][c][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` may not match all heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the nitrogen is part of the ring attached to the carboxyl group. Use a more flexible pattern like `'n1cccc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` to match rings like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Correct the pattern for Rule 6.1**. For heterocycles attached via an additional aromatic ring, the current pattern may not accurately capture all relevant structures. Use a pattern like `'c1ccc(-c2[nH]ccc2)[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` to match compounds like 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Differentiate between aliphatic and aromatic thiols in Rule 7**. Ensure the aliphatic thiol pattern `'[CX4][SX2H]'` and the aromatic thiol pattern `'c[SX2H]'` accurately capture thiol groups attached to aliphatic versus aromatic carbons.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Enhance the patterns for bulky versus less bulky aromatic side chains in Rule 8**. The current patterns may not distinguish effectively. For tryptophan, use a pattern that captures the indole side chain: `'[NX3H2]-[CX4H]-[CX4]-c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2'`. For phenylalanine, use `'[NX3H2]-[CX4H]-[CX4]-c1ccccc1'`.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Expand the perfluoroalkyl group pattern in Rule 9**. The current pattern `'[CX4]([F])([F])([F])'` matches only trifluoromethyl groups. Modify it to include longer perfluoroalkyl chains, e.g., `'[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4][F]'` and use recursion or repetition to capture multiple fluorinated carbons.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Revise the ether linkage pattern in Rule 10**. The current pattern may not match all polyether chains. Use a recursive pattern to match repeating ethylene glycol units: `'[CX3](=O)[OX2][CX4]([OX2][CX4]){2,}[OX2][CX3](=O)'`.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Correct the pattern for multiple hydroxyl groups in Rule 11**. The current pattern is too specific for gluconic acid. Use a more general pattern that matches aliphatic chains with multiple hydroxyls: `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[*]'`.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Adjust the patterns for hydroxyl groups in Rule 12 and Rule 12.1**. Ensure that the pattern for hydroxyls separated by an aliphatic linker captures the necessary compounds by using patterns like `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4][CX4][c][OX2H]'` and that the pattern for hydroxyls directly on the ring matches the intended structures.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Enhance the amide bond pattern in Rule 13**. The current pattern may not match all amide-containing modifiers. Use a more inclusive pattern like `'[NX3][CX3](=O)'` to capture both simple and peptide-like amide bonds.

- **Suggestion 16**: **Verify and adjust the aldehyde pattern in Rule 14**. Ensure that the pattern `'c1cc([CX3H]=O)ccc1'` matches aromatic rings with aldehyde groups, and consider tautomeric forms if necessary.

- **Suggestion 17**: **Review the pattern for carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings in Rule 15**. The current pattern may be too specific. Use a pattern like `'c1ccc2c(c1)C(=O)OC2=O'` to match various lactones and ketones fused to aromatic rings.

Metric Commenter Message:
After analyzing the current rule metrics in comparison to the previous metrics, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current rules, particularly focusing on confidence and lift.

**Support Comparison:**

- **Previous Mean Train Support:** Approximately 0.175 (averaging 0.1667 and 0.1845).
- **Current Train Support:** 0.0182.

**Analysis:** The train support has significantly decreased from around 17.5% to 1.82%. This indicates that the current rules apply to a much smaller portion of the training dataset. The low support suggests that while the rules might be accurate for specific instances, they lack general applicability across the dataset.

**Confidence Comparison:**

- **Previous Train Confidence Range:** Between 0.5396 and 0.6352.
- **Average Previous Train Confidence:** Approximately 0.5874.
- **Current Train Confidence:** 0.5930.

**Analysis:** The current train confidence is slightly higher than the average of the previous metrics but remains within a similar range. This suggests that when the current rules are applicable, they predict the outcome with a similar level of certainty as before. The marginal increase in confidence is positive but not substantial enough to offset the decrease in support.

**Lift Comparison:**

- **Previous Train Lift Range:** Between 1.0559 and 1.2048.
- **Average Previous Train Lift:** Approximately 1.1304.
- **Current Train Lift:** 1.1929.

**Analysis:** The lift has increased from the previous average of 1.1304 to 1.1929. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. The increase suggests that the current rules have a stronger association with the high-yield outcome when they are applicable.

**Leverage Comparison:**

- **Previous Train Leverage Average:** Approximately 0.0124 (averaging 0.0289 and -0.0041).
- **Current Train Leverage:** 0.0062.

**Analysis:** Leverage has decreased from the previous average. Positive leverage indicates a stronger association than expected by chance, but the low value underscores that the improvement is minimal. The decrease suggests that while the rules are slightly better than chance, they do not contribute significantly to identifying high-yield outcomes beyond what is expected.

**Overall Assessment:**

- **Decrease in Support:** The significant drop in support is concerning. It means that the current rules cover a very small fraction of the data, limiting their practical utility.
- **Stable Confidence:** Confidence remains relatively stable, indicating consistency in the rules' predictive accuracy when they apply.
- **Slight Improvement in Lift:** The increase in lift is a positive sign, suggesting that the rules are more effective at predicting high-yield outcomes than before.
- **Leverage Indicates Limited Impact:** The low leverage value points to a minimal increase in the rules' ability to find correlations beyond chance.

**Local Minimum and Iterations:**

Given the current metrics, it appears that the optimization process may have reached a local minimum. The rules have become very specific, capturing niche cases with high predictive accuracy but at the expense of general applicability (as evidenced by the low support). This trade-off suggests that further iterations focusing solely on optimizing existing rules may yield diminishing returns.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Expand Rule Generality:**

   - **Issue:** Overly specific rules lead to low support.
   - **Solution:** Generalize the rules to cover a broader range of data without significantly compromising confidence and lift. This can be achieved by identifying common features among high-yield modifiers that are currently excluded due to narrow rule definitions.

2. **Re-evaluate Rule Conditions:**

   - **Issue:** Some rules may include conditions that unnecessarily restrict their applicability.
   - **Solution:** Analyze each rule to determine if certain conditions can be relaxed or removed. For example, consider whether the chain length specifications can be broadened or if certain functional groups consistently influence yield regardless of their position.

3. **Incorporate Additional Predictive Features:**

   - **Issue:** Current rules may not account for all relevant factors influencing yield.
   - **Solution:** Introduce new variables or molecular descriptors that capture other aspects of the modifiers, such as electronic properties, steric hindrance, or solubility parameters.

4. **Balance Specificity and Coverage:**

   - **Issue:** High confidence and lift are achieved at the cost of low support.
   - **Solution:** Aim for a balance where the rules are sufficiently specific to maintain predictive accuracy but broad enough to be applicable to a larger portion of the dataset.

5. **Use Statistical Techniques:**

   - **Issue:** Manual rule adjustment may not efficiently explore the solution space.
   - **Solution:** Employ machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees or association rule mining with adjusted parameters, to discover rules that optimize support, confidence, and lift simultaneously.

6. **Cross-Validation:**

   - **Issue:** Overfitting to the training data may misrepresent actual performance.
   - **Solution:** Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data, adjusting them based on their performance across different subsets of the dataset.

**Conclusion:**

The current rules demonstrate high confidence and improved lift but suffer from low support, indicating limited applicability. To enhance the performance of the rules, it is essential to increase their generalizability without significantly sacrificing predictive power. By broadening the conditions and incorporating additional predictive features, the rules can be made more robust and useful for predicting high-yield outcomes across a wider range of modifiers. Further iterations should focus on balancing specificity with coverage to avoid being trapped in a local minimum and to continue improving the model's overall performance.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Accuracy Comparison**

The previous validation accuracies were consistently around **0.76**, with test accuracies ranging from **0.625** to **0.75**. In the current iteration, the model achieved a validation accuracy of **0.6571**. This represents a decrease in performance compared to previous iterations.

**Summary of Accuracies:**

- **Previous Validation Accuracies:** Approximately **0.76**
- **Previous Test Accuracies:** **0.625** to **0.75**
- **Current Validation Accuracy:** **0.6571**

**Interpretation:**

- The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be as effective as before.
- The model's ability to generalize to unseen data has diminished, indicating potential issues with the current rules.

---

**2. Effectiveness of Current Rules**

The effectiveness of the current rules can be assessed based on their impact on the model's predictive performance.

- **Decrease in Accuracy:** The reduction in validation accuracy implies that the current rules are less effective in capturing the underlying patterns in the data.
- **Consistency Issues:** The model shows inconsistencies in predicting the correct loading for certain modifiers, as evidenced by discrepancies between predicted and experimental values.

**Conclusion:**

- The current rules are **not effective enough** and may require refinement.
- Some rules might be introducing noise or leading to misclassifications.

---

**3. Assessing Overfitting and Underfitting**

**Overfitting Indicators:**

- **Complexity of Rules:** The inclusion of additional rules (e.g., Rules 20, 21, 22) may have increased the complexity of the model, causing it to fit the training data too closely.
- **Decreased Validation Accuracy:** Despite potentially higher training accuracy, the validation accuracy has decreased, suggesting overfitting.

**Underfitting Indicators:**

- **Low Overall Accuracy:** If both training and validation accuracies are low, the model may be underfitting. However, we lack explicit training accuracy data.

**Conclusion:**

- The model is likely **overfitting** due to the addition of new rules that do not generalize well to the validation set.
- Simplifying the rules or reducing their complexity may help improve generalization.

---

**4. Analyzing SHAP Values and Discrepancies**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis highlights the contribution of each rule to the model's prediction for individual molecules. By focusing on molecules where the model's predictions mismatch the experimental values, we can identify problematic rules.

**Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

1. **Molecule:** C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
   - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
     - **Rule 20:** **0.0799**
     - **Rule 15:** **0.0311**
     - **Rule 21:** **0.0236**
   - **Interpretation:** Rule 20 significantly contributes to the overestimation.

2. **Molecule:** C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O
   - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
     - **Rule 20:** **0.0799**
     - **Rule 15:** **0.0311**
     - **Rule 21:** **0.0236**
   - **Interpretation:** Again, Rule 20 is a major contributor.

3. **Molecule:** C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O
   - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
     - **Rule 20:** **0.0644**
     - **Rule 15:** **0.0222**
     - **Rule 21:** **0.0221**
   - **Interpretation:** Rule 20 significantly affects the overestimated prediction.

4. **Other Molecules with Similar Issues:**
   - Molecules where predicted loading is high but experimental value is low consistently show high positive SHAP values for **Rule 20**, **Rule 15**, and **Rule 21**.

**Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

- **No significant cases noted in the provided data.**

**Conclusion:**

- **Rule 20** is frequently associated with overestimations where the model predicts a high loading but the experimental value is low.
- **Rule 15** and **Rule 21** also contribute positively but to a lesser extent.
- These rules may be overly general or incorrectly structured, leading to misclassifications.

---

**5. Interpret Accuracy Metrics for Rule Improvement**

- **Decrease in Validation Accuracy:** Suggests that recent modifications to the rules (especially the addition of new rules like Rule 20) have negatively impacted model performance.
- **Consistency in Misclassifications:** Repeated overestimations linked to specific rules point to opportunities for refining those rules.

**Conclusion:**

- The probability of improvement is low without revising the rules contributing to misclassifications.
- Focusing on refining or removing problematic rules can potentially enhance accuracy.

---

**6. Insights from SHAP Analysis for Rule Improvement**

- **High Positive SHAP Values in Misclassifications:** Indicate that certain rules are strongly influencing the model to predict high loading incorrectly.
- **Rule 20's Impact:** The consistent appearance of Rule 20 with high positive SHAP values in overestimation cases suggests it may not be appropriately defined.
- **Potential Overlap or Redundancy:** Rules may be overlapping in their conditions, causing the model to overweight certain features.

**Conclusion:**

- Refining or redefining **Rule 20** is essential.
- Assessing the specificity and applicability of **Rule 15** and **Rule 21** can also contribute to reducing misclassifications.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

---

**Final Thoughts**

The current decrease in validation accuracy, coupled with the misclassifications highlighted by SHAP analysis, indicates that the model's performance has been adversely affected by the recent addition or modification of certain rules. By focusing on refining rules with high positive SHAP values in overestimated cases—particularly Rule 20—and assessing the overall complexity of the rule set, improvements can be made.

Iterative refinement, guided by systematic analysis and validation, will be key to enhancing the model's predictive capabilities. Collaboratively reviewing and updating the rules, while ensuring they align with experimental observations, will support the overall objectives of the research program.

**Summary and Suggestions for Optimizing Current Rules**

**Summary of Discussions:**

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has been analyzed thoroughly. The key findings from the analysis are:

- **Low Support:** The train support has decreased significantly to approximately 1.8%, indicating that the current rules apply to a very small portion of the dataset. This limited applicability reduces the practical utility of the rules.
  
- **Stable Confidence and Lift:** The train confidence remains around 59%, and the lift has improved slightly to 1.19. This suggests that when the rules are applicable, they predict high-yield outcomes with reasonable accuracy.

- **Decrease in Validation Accuracy:** The validation accuracy has dropped from around 76% in previous iterations to approximately 65.7%. This indicates that the model's predictive performance on unseen data has deteriorated.

- **SHAP Analysis Insights:** The SHAP analysis revealed that certain rules, particularly **Rule 20**, are contributing significantly to misclassifications where the model predicts a high yield but the experimental value is low. This suggests that some rules may be overly general or inaccurately defined.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Generalize Overly Specific Rules to Increase Support:**

   - **Issue:** The current rules are too specific, resulting in low support.
   - **Action:** Broaden the scope of the rules by relaxing certain conditions to cover a wider range of molecules without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
   - **Example:** In **Rule 2**, adjust the SMARTS pattern to include omega-amino acids with chain lengths ranging from 2 to 5 carbons instead of only 5-carbons. Use a pattern like `'[NX3H2]-[CX4]-[CX4]{0,3}-[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` to match chains with varying lengths.

2. **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Accurate Matching:**

   - **Issue:** Some SMARTS patterns do not accurately capture all relevant compounds or exclude important ones.
   - **Action:** Review and adjust the SMARTS patterns to ensure they match the intended chemical structures accurately.
   - **Example:** For **Rule 1**, modify the `alpha_amino_acid` pattern to include amino acids with acidic side chains by updating it to `'[NX3H2]-[CX4H](-[CX3](=O)[OX1H])-[*]'` and ensuring that molecules with multiple carboxylic acid groups are captured.

3. **Re-evaluate and Refine Problematic Rules:**

   - **Issue:** Certain rules, like **Rule 20**, are causing misclassifications by overestimating the yield.
   - **Action:** Analyze these rules to identify why they are leading to incorrect predictions and adjust their criteria to be more specific or consider removing them if they cannot be corrected.
   - **Example:** Examine **Rule 20** to determine if it is too general or if its conditions overlap with other rules, and refine its SMARTS pattern to target only the compounds that truly contribute to high yield.

4. **Improve Specificity of Rules Affecting Aromatic Compounds:**

   - **Issue:** Rules involving aromatic compounds may be too broad, causing inaccurate predictions.
   - **Action:** Enhance the patterns for electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups by incorporating position-specific SMARTS patterns and accounting for various substituents.
   - **Example:** For **Rule 4**, use a pattern like `'c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` combined with position-specific patterns for electron-withdrawing groups at the para position, such as `'c1cc([NX3+(=O)[O-]])cc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`.

5. **Differentiate Between Similar Functional Groups:**

   - **Issue:** Lack of differentiation between functional groups attached to aliphatic or aromatic systems can lead to misclassifications.
   - **Action:** Use distinct SMARTS patterns to distinguish between similar functional groups in different chemical environments.
   - **Example:** In **Rule 7**, separate patterns for aliphatic thiols (`'[CX4][SX2H]'`) and aromatic thiols (`'c[SX2H]'`) can help accurately predict their impact on yield.

6. **Expand Coverage of Fluorinated Compounds:**

   - **Issue:** Current patterns may not capture all perfluoroalkyl groups affecting yield.
   - **Action:** Use recursive SMARTS patterns to include longer perfluoroalkyl chains.
   - **Example:** Modify the pattern in **Rule 9** to `'[CX4]([F])([F])([F])[CX4][F]'` and iterate to match longer chains.

7. **Account for Additional Molecular Descriptors:**

   - **Issue:** Important molecular characteristics affecting yield may not be included.
   - **Action:** Incorporate descriptors like steric hindrance, electronic effects, and hydrogen bonding capacity into the rules.
   - **Example:** Consider the presence of bulky groups or hydrogen bond donors/acceptors that may influence catalyst interaction.

8. **Balance Rule Specificity and Generality:**

   - **Issue:** Overly specific rules improve accuracy but decrease support, while overly general rules increase support but may reduce accuracy.
   - **Action:** Find an optimal balance to maintain high confidence and lift while increasing support.
   - **Example:** Adjust conditions in **Rule 8** to include amino acids with aromatic side chains by defining broader patterns that still distinguish between bulky and less bulky groups.

9. **Use Statistical Techniques for Rule Discovery:**

   - **Issue:** Manual rule adjustments may be insufficient to explore all patterns in the data.
   - **Action:** Apply machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees or association rule mining with adjusted parameters, to discover new rules that optimize support, confidence, and lift simultaneously.

10. **Iterative Validation and Testing:**

    - **Issue:** Overfitting may occur if rules are not validated across different datasets.
    - **Action:** Employ cross-validation techniques and continuously test the rules on validation sets to ensure they generalize well.
    - **Example:** Use k-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of the revised rules and adjust them based on feedback.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

There is a strong possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By generalizing overly specific rules to cover more data, refining problematic rules that lead to misclassifications, and incorporating additional molecular descriptors, we can improve the model's performance. Careful validation using cross-validation and SHAP analysis will help ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data, minimizing the risk of overfitting.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**, specifically those containing an additional carboxylic acid group beyond the alpha-carboxyl (e.g., aspartic acid and glutamic acid), lead to **high yield**. Examples: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer**, such as **5-aminopentanoic acid**, result in **high yield**. In contrast, longer-chain omega-amino acids with more than five carbons, like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, lead to **low yield**.

- **Rule 3**: **Unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of eight carbons and no additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. Conversely, similar aliphatic acids with polar substituents—especially terminal hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH₂) groups—result in **low yield**. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 4**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as nitro (-NO₂) or bromomethyl (-CH₂Br) substituents, lead to **high yield**. Examples are **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. In contrast, similar compounds with electron-donating groups at the para position, like methyl (-CH₃) in **4-methylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-amino (-NH₂) groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **4-aminobenzoic acid**. The amino group may facilitate better coordination with the catalyst, enhancing the reaction efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: **Heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the nitrogen atom is part of the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. However, when the nitrogen-containing heterocycle is attached via an additional aromatic ring, as in **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, the yield is **low**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with terminal thiol (-SH) groups attached to aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. Conversely, modifiers with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic aromatic side chains**, particularly **tryptophan**, lead to **high yield**. This may be due to π-π stacking interactions facilitating catalyst activity. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan). In contrast, amino acids with less bulky aromatic side chains, like **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may hinder effective coordination with the catalytic sites.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially those containing polyether chains like triethylene glycol units, result in **low yield**. Examples are **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. The ether chains may introduce steric hindrance or alter the solubility profile, negatively affecting catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the carbon chain** lead to **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). The multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance binding affinity to the catalyst through hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (-OH) groups separated from the carboxylic acid by an aliphatic linker** lead to **high yield**. An example is **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**. In contrast, similar compounds where the hydroxyl group is directly attached to the aromatic ring without an aliphatic linker, like **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds**, particularly those formed by acylation of amino acids or linking amino acid residues, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**. The presence of amide bonds may interfere with optimal catalyst coordination due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons on the nitrogen.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (-CHO) functional groups attached to an aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. An example is **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**. Aldehyde groups may participate in side reactions or deactivate catalytic sites.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to an aromatic ring within a lactone or ketone structure** lead to **high yield**. An example is **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**. The carbonyl groups may facilitate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: *Generalize Overly Specific Rules to Increase Support*

  - **Action**: Broaden the scope of existing rules by relaxing certain conditions in the SMARTS patterns to cover a wider range of molecules without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
  
  - **Implementation**: In **Rule 2**, modify the SMARTS pattern to include omega-amino acids with chain lengths ranging from 2 to 5 carbons instead of only five carbons. Update the SMARTS pattern to `'NCC[CX4H2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`, allowing for variable aliphatic chain lengths and capturing more compounds that could lead to high yield.

- **Advice 2**: *Refine SMARTS Patterns for Accurate Matching*

  - **Action**: Review and adjust SMARTS patterns to ensure they accurately capture all relevant compounds and exclude irrelevant ones.
  
  - **Implementation**: For **Rule 1**, modify the SMARTS pattern to include amino acids with acidic side chains containing an additional carboxylic acid group. Use a pattern like `'N[C@@H](CC(=O)O)C(=O)O'` to capture aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and similar compounds, ensuring accurate matching of molecules that lead to high yield.

- **Advice 3**: *Re-evaluate and Refine Problematic Rules*

  - **Action**: Identify rules contributing to misclassifications, analyze why they lead to incorrect predictions, and adjust their criteria to improve accuracy.
  
  - **Implementation**: Examine **Rule 9** related to perfluoroalkyl groups. Refine the SMARTS pattern to specifically match compounds with highly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups attached directly to the carboxylic acid, such as `'C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(=O)O'`, and exclude compounds where the perfluoroalkyl group is farther from the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 4**: *Improve Specificity of Rules Affecting Aromatic Compounds*

  - **Action**: Enhance SMARTS patterns for aromatic compounds by incorporating position-specific patterns and accounting for various substituents to avoid overgeneralization.
  
  - **Implementation**: In **Rule 4**, adjust the SMARTS pattern to ensure that only electron-withdrawing groups at the para position are matched. Use a pattern like `'c1cc([NX3+](=O)[O-])ccc1C(=O)O'` for nitrobenzoic acids. This refinement helps differentiate between compounds with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, improving prediction accuracy.

- **Advice 5**: *Differentiate Between Similar Functional Groups in Different Environments*

  - **Action**: Use distinct SMARTS patterns to distinguish functional groups attached to aliphatic chains from those attached directly to aromatic rings.
  
  - **Implementation**: For **Rule 7**, create separate patterns for aliphatic thiols and aromatic thiols. For aliphatic thiols leading to high yield, use `'C[CX4][SX2H]'`. For aromatic thiols resulting in low yield, use `'c[SH]'`. This differentiation ensures accurate classification based on the functional group's environment.

- **Advice 6**: *Expand Coverage of Fluorinated Compounds*

  - **Action**: Use recursive SMARTS patterns to include a broader range of perfluoroalkyl groups affecting yield.
  
  - **Implementation**: In **Rule 9**, modify the SMARTS pattern to include longer perfluoroalkyl chains by using recursive smarts. For example, `'C(F)(F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` captures perfluoroalkyl chains of varying lengths directly attached to the carboxylic acid, improving the rule's coverage.

- **Advice 7**: *Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors*

  - **Action**: Include molecular descriptors such as steric hindrance, electronic effects, and hydrogen bonding capacity into the rules to account for factors influencing yield.
  
  - **Implementation**: For **Rule 8**, which involves amino acids with bulky hydrophobic aromatic side chains, quantify steric bulk using descriptors like the presence of fused aromatic rings. Modify the rule to specify that amino acids with fused ring systems like indole result in high yield, while those with single aromatic rings like phenylalanine do not.

- **Advice 8**: *Balance Rule Specificity and Generality*

  - **Action**: Adjust rule conditions to achieve an optimal balance between specificity and generality, maintaining high confidence and lift while increasing support.
  
  - **Implementation**: Revisit rules like **Rule 3** and broaden the chain length criteria for aliphatic carboxylic acids to include chains from six to ten carbons. Adjust the SMARTS pattern to `'CCCCCCC[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`, which includes more compounds while still targeting those that lead to high yield.

- **Advice 9**: *Apply Statistical Techniques for Rule Discovery*

  - **Action**: Use machine learning algorithms to discover new rules that optimize support, confidence, and lift simultaneously, capturing patterns not evident through manual rule adjustments.
  
  - **Implementation**: Utilize decision tree classifiers or association rule mining on the dataset to identify new combinations of molecular features associated with high yield. Incorporate these findings into new or existing rules to enhance predictive performance.

- **Advice 10**: *Implement Iterative Validation and Testing*

  - **Action**: Continuously validate and test the rules using cross-validation techniques to ensure they generalize well to unseen data and prevent overfitting.
  
  - **Implementation**: After each rule modification, evaluate performance metrics such as validation accuracy, support, confidence, and lift. Use k-fold cross-validation to assess the rules' effectiveness across different subsets of data, making further adjustments based on the results.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Descriptors into Quantifiable Features**

  Recast the rules to focus on specific, quantifiable molecular features that can be directly derived from SMILES strings. For example, instead of using terms like "bulky hydrophobic aromatic side chains," specify the exact structural components, such as "presence of an indole ring" or "number of aromatic rings connected to an aliphatic chain." This allows for the creation of binary or numerical descriptors that can be used in a quantitative feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Rules Based on Common Structural Features**

  Identify common structural motifs among modifiers that lead to high or low yields and group them accordingly. For instance, group all modifiers containing specific functional groups like carboxylic acids, amines, or thiols. This simplification reduces complexity and makes it easier to encode the rules into numerical features.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints**

  Utilize molecular descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, LogP, topological polar surface area) and fingerprints (e.g., ECFP, MACCS keys) that can be calculated directly from SMILES. These descriptors convert molecular structures into numerical values, facilitating the generation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 4**: **Specify Functional Group Counts**

  Modify the rules to include counts of specific functional groups. For example, instead of stating "modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups," specify "modifiers containing five hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain." This precision allows for numerical representation (e.g., hydroxyl group count = 5).

- **Advice 5**: **Define Structural Parameters Numerically**

  Introduce numerical parameters such as chain length, degree of branching, number of ring structures, and heteroatom counts (nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur atoms). For example, "Modifiers with aliphatic chains of five carbons (chain length = 5) result in high yield."

- **Advice 6**: **Use Substructure Searches to Identify Key Features**

  Implement substructure searching within SMILES strings to detect the presence or absence of specific moieties. For instance, rules can specify that the presence of a pyridine ring attached directly to a carboxyl group corresponds to high yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Eliminate Ambiguous Language**

  Avoid subjective terms like "bulky," "electron-withdrawing," or "less bulky." Replace them with objective criteria, such as "presence of a methyl group at the para position," or "number of fluorine atoms in perfluoroalkyl groups."

- **Advice 8**: **Create Binary Features for Presence or Absence of Groups**

  Transform rules into binary features indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of specific functional groups or substructures. For example, "Modifiers with a thiol group attached to an aliphatic chain (thiol_aliphatic = 1) lead to high yield."

- **Advice 9**: **Integrate Heteroatom Connectivity Information**

  Include rules that consider the connectivity of heteroatoms within the molecule. For example, "Modifiers where nitrogen atoms are part of an aromatic ring directly attached to the carboxyl group (aromatic_N_connected = 1) result in high yield."

- **Advice 10**: **Reevaluate and Simplify Complex Rules**

  For rules with exceptions or multiple conditions, consider breaking them down into simpler, more general rules. This approach can help in identifying the primary factors affecting yield and streamline the feature extraction process.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar substituents**—such as hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH₂), or ether groups—tend to result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. In contrast, **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents** or **longer chain lengths (more than eight carbons)** tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position**—such as nitro (-NO₂) or bromomethyl (-CH₂Br) groups—lead to **high yield**. Examples: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. Conversely, **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents at the para position**—such as methyl (-CH₃) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups—result in **low yield**. Examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. Notably, **para-amino (-NH₂) groups** are an exception and result in **high yield**, as seen with **4-aminobenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**, specifically those containing an additional carboxylic acid group beyond the alpha-carboxyl, lead to **high yield**. Examples: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. In contrast, **omega-amino acids with chain lengths greater than five carbons** result in **low yield**. Examples: **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings separated from hydrophilic groups (e.g., hydroxyl groups) by aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. An example is **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**. Conversely, **modifiers where hydrophilic groups are directly attached to the aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. Examples include **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. However, **when the nitrogen-containing heterocycle is connected via an additional aromatic ring**, as in **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, the yield is **low**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. In contrast, **modifiers with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings**, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**. The abundance of hydroxyl groups may enhance interactions with the catalyst through hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds**, particularly those formed by acylation of amino acids or linking amino acid residues, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, including polyether chains, result in **low yield**. Examples are **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated alkyl chains** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may hinder effective coordination with the catalytic sites.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic aromatic side chains**, particularly those containing an indole ring, lead to **high yield**. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan). In contrast, **amino acids with less bulky aromatic side chains**, like **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to an aromatic ring within a fused lactone or ketone structure** lead to **high yield**. An example is **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**. The carbonyl groups may facilitate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains terminated with aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (C=O) groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**. The presence of these groups may interfere with catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents on the aliphatic chain**, such as methoxy groups or other large functional groups, tend to result in **high yield**. An example is **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**. The bulky groups may enhance binding affinity to the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Adjust Rule 1 to Account for Low Yield Cases**  
  The current implementation of Rule 1 only returns `1` for high-yield cases and `0` otherwise. According to the rule, modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents or chain lengths greater than eight carbons should result in **low yield** (`-1`). Modify the code to return `-1` when these conditions are met. Specifically:
  - Include a condition to check for polar substituents (hydroxyl, amino, ether groups) and return `-1` if found.
  - Check if the chain length exceeds eight carbons and return `-1` in that case.
  
- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Improve Branching Detection in Rule 1**  
  The current code checks for atoms with a degree greater than `2` to detect branching, which incorrectly includes the carboxyl carbon (degree `3` due to double bonds). This can lead to false positives for branching. Refine the branching detection by:
  - Excluding the carboxyl carbon from the branching check.
  - Considering branching only when a carbon atom is connected to more than two **carbon** atoms (degree with respect to carbons).
  - Using SMARTS patterns to identify branching points more accurately.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Enhance Polar Substituent Detection in Rule 1**  
  The current code searches for any oxygen or nitrogen atoms as polar substituents, which might not accurately identify all relevant functional groups (e.g., it might miss ethers or mistakenly include non-polar oxygens). Improve polar substituent detection by:
  - Using specific SMARTS patterns to detect hydroxyl (`[OX2H]`), amino (`[NX3;H2,H1;!$(NC=O)]`), and ether groups (`[OD2]([#6])[#6]`).
  - Excluding oxygens in the carboxyl group by more precise matching.
  - Returning `-1` if any polar substituents are found.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Expand EWG Detection in Rule 2**  
  Rule 2 currently only checks for nitro and bromomethyl groups as electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). Expand the code to include other common EWGs at the para position, such as:
  - **Cyano group** (`-C≡N`): SMARTS `[c][c]C#N`.
  - **Trifluoromethyl group** (`-CF₃`): SMARTS `[c][c][C](F)(F)F`.
  - Modify the code to iterate over a list of EWG SMARTS patterns.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Refine EDG and Para-Position Checks in Rule 2 Negative**  
  The current implementation might incorrectly match substituents not in the para position or miss certain EDGs. Improve the code by:
  - Using SMARTS patterns that specifically match substituents at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.
  - Defining patterns for common EDGs, such as methyl (`[cH]c[cH][cH][cX4][CH3]`), hydroxyl (`[cH]c[cH][cH][c][OH]`), and excluding the para-amino group as specified.
  - Ensuring that only substituents directly attached to the ring at the para position are considered.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Correct Amino Acid Matching in Rule 3**  
  The current SMARTS pattern for amino acids with acidic side chains may not match all relevant molecules. Enhance Rule 3 by:
  - Using a more accurate pattern to detect amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acids, such as aspartic and glutamic acid.
  - Ensuring that the code checks for an α-amino acid backbone and an additional carboxyl group in the side chain.
  - Adjusting the SMARTS pattern to `[NX3;H2][CX4;H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX1H]` for the backbone and checking for another `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` in the side chain.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Accurately Calculate Chain Length in Rule 4**  
  Improve the chain length calculation between the amino group and the carboxyl group by:
  - Using `Chem.GetDistanceMatrix(mol)` to compute all pairwise distances.
  - Identifying the shortest path between the amino nitrogen and the carboxyl carbon.
  - Assigning `1` if the path length (number of bonds) is `≤5` carbons and `-1` if `>5` carbons, as per the rule.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Enhance Detection in Rule 5**  
  The current SMARTS patterns may not accurately detect modifiers where aromatic rings are separated from hydrophilic groups by aliphatic chains. Improve Rule 5 by:
  - Using SMARTS for hydrophilic groups connected via aliphatic chains, e.g., `[$(c)]-[$(C)]{2,}-[OX2H]`.
  - Ensuring that negative cases (hydrophilic groups directly attached to the aromatic ring) are detected with patterns like `[c][OX2H]`.
  - Considering variations in chain lengths and different hydrophilic groups.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Differentiate Ring Connectivity in Rule 6**  
  To better distinguish between heteroaromatic rings directly connected to a carboxyl group and those connected via another ring:
  - Use more precise SMARTS, such as `[nH0;r5][c;r5](=O)[O,H]` for positive cases.
  - For negative cases, detect extended conjugation with patterns like `[c][c][n][c](=O)[O,H]`.
  - Ensure that the code checks the nature of the ring system accurately.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Improve Chain Length Calculation in Rule 7**  
  The code should more precisely identify thiol groups attached to short aliphatic chains:
  - Use `Chem.GetDistanceMatrix(mol)` to calculate the shortest path between the thiol sulfur and the carboxyl carbon.
  - Assign `1` if the chain length is `≤5` atoms (excluding the thiol hydrogen and carboxyl oxygens).
  - Modify the code to detect thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings with patterns like `[c][SX2H]` and assign `-1` accordingly.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: **Revise SMARTS Patterns Across All Rules for Accuracy**  
  Go through each rule and:
  - Verify that the SMARTS patterns accurately represent the functional groups and structures described in the natural language rules.
  - Test the SMARTS patterns independently to ensure they match the intended substructures.
  - Consider using RDKit's `MolSubstructMatch` with appropriate parameters to increase matching accuracy.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: **Include Explicit Negative Cases in Code Logic**  
  For rules that have both high and low yield outcomes based on different structural features (e.g., chain length, substituent type), ensure that the code explicitly checks for negative cases and assigns `-1` where appropriate. Do not default to `0` when a positive case isn't found.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: **Add Exception Handling for Parsing Errors**  
  In the main loop where SMILES strings are processed, handle molecules that cannot be parsed more robustly:
  - Provide warnings or error messages indicating which molecules couldn't be parsed.
  - Ensure that parsing errors don't silently pass unnoticed, potentially masking issues with the input data.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: **Validate Feature Matrix Against Expected Outcomes**  
  After generating the feature matrix, validate it against known outcomes:
  - Compare the assigned feature values with expected values based on manual analysis.
  - Adjust the code where discrepancies are found to improve accuracy.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: **Document Code and Logic for Clarity**  
  Enhance the code readability and maintainability by:
  - Adding comments explaining the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and code block.
  - Clearly documenting any exceptions or special cases handled.
  - Providing examples of molecules that match each rule to aid future debugging and validation.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Metrics Compared to Reference Metrics**

**1. Train Support**
- **Current**: 0.0554
- **Previous Mean**: Approximately 0.1756
- **Interpretation**: The current train support is significantly lower than the previous average. This means that the current set of rules applies to about **5.54%** of the training data, whereas the previous rules applied to approximately **17.56%**. A lower support indicates that the rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset.

**2. Train Confidence**
- **Current**: 0.6559
- **Previous Mean**: Approximately 0.5874
- **Interpretation**: The current train confidence has increased compared to the previous average. This indicates that when the current rules apply, they correctly predict the outcome **65.59%** of the time, which is an improvement over the previous **58.74%**. Higher confidence reflects better predictive accuracy for the covered cases.

**3. Train Lift**
- **Current**: 1.3146
- **Previous Mean**: Approximately 1.1304
- **Interpretation**: The lift has improved from the previous mean. A lift of **1.3146** suggests that the presence of the rule conditions makes the outcome **31.46%** more likely compared to random chance. This is a stronger association than the previous lift of **1.1304**.

**4. Train Leverage**
- **Current**: 0.01597
- **Previous Mean**: Approximately 0.01238
- **Interpretation**: The leverage has slightly increased. Positive leverage indicates that the rule is more effective than random chance. The current leverage of **0.01597** shows a modest improvement over the previous average, suggesting a slightly stronger association.

---

**Performance Evaluation**

The current set of rules demonstrates the following:

- **Higher Confidence and Lift**: The increase in confidence and lift values indicates that the rules are more accurate and have a stronger association with the outcome when they apply.
  
- **Lower Support**: The decline in support suggests that the rules apply to a smaller subset of the data. While they are more precise, they are less generalizable across the entire dataset.

- **Improved Leverage**: The slight increase in leverage signifies that the rules offer a marginal improvement over random chance in terms of additional support.

---

**Assessment of Iterations and Local Minimum**

Given the improvements in confidence and lift, but a decrease in support, it's important to assess whether a local minimum has been reached:

- **Trade-off Between Support and Confidence**: The current iteration seems to have optimized for confidence and lift at the expense of support. This trade-off suggests that the model might be overfitting to specific subsets of data.

- **Local Minimum**: The metrics indicate that the current rules may be reaching a point where further optimizations are yielding diminishing returns in terms of coverage (support) while slightly improving predictive power (confidence and lift). This could signify that a local minimum has been approached.

- **Iteration Sufficiency**: Considering the metrics and the size of the dataset covered, more iterations may be necessary to find a better balance between rule coverage and predictive accuracy.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

1. **Increase Rule Coverage (Support)**:
   - **Broaden Rule Conditions**: Modify existing rules to be less restrictive by generalizing certain conditions. For example, instead of specifying exact chain lengths or substituents, group similar functional groups or ranges.
   - **Incorporate Additional Data**: Include more examples or counterexamples to enhance the diversity of the dataset, which may help in formulating rules that cover a larger portion of the data.

2. **Maintain or Enhance Confidence and Lift**:
   - **Optimize Critical Features**: Identify which features contribute most to the confidence and lift, and ensure they are included in the broader rules.
   - **Rule Pruning**: Eliminate or adjust rules that contribute minimally to confidence and lift but reduce support significantly.

3. **Balance Specificity and Generality**:
   - **Create Hierarchical Rules**: Develop rules at different levels of specificity. General rules can cover more data with moderate confidence, while specific rules can capture exceptions with higher confidence.
   - **Use Weighted Metrics**: Consider a weighted approach that values both support and confidence appropriately, to avoid over-optimizing one at the expense of the other.

4. **Avoid Overfitting**:
   - **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules perform well on unseen data.
   - **Simplify Rule Set**: Reduce the complexity of the rules where possible to enhance generalization.

5. **Explore New Features or Descriptors**:
   - **Chemical Intuition**: Incorporate additional chemical descriptors that may influence catalytic activity, such as electronic properties, steric factors, or solvent interactions.
   - **Data-Driven Insights**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to identify patterns or associations not captured by the current rules.

6. **Further Iterations**:
   - **Iterative Refinement**: Continue iterating on the rule set, monitoring changes in support, confidence, lift, and leverage to find an optimal balance.
   - **Benchmarking**: Compare the performance of the rules against baseline models or alternative approaches to gauge improvement.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules exhibit improved confidence and lift, indicating stronger and more reliable associations when they apply. However, the reduced support highlights a limitation in their applicability across the dataset. To enhance the overall performance, it's crucial to adjust the rules to cover a larger portion of the data while maintaining high predictive accuracy. This may involve generalizing certain conditions, pruning overly specific rules, and incorporating additional features. Further iterations and careful balancing of the metrics are recommended to avoid local minima and achieve a robust set of rules that effectively predict catalytic outcomes.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation Set and Train Set:**

The latest iteration of the classification model has achieved a **validation accuracy of 77.14%**, which marks an improvement over previous iterations and reference metrics. Here's a comparative analysis:

- **Previous Reference Accuracies:**
  - Validation accuracies consistently at **76%** with test accuracies ranging between **62.5%** and **75%**.
- **Current Iterations:**
  - Earlier iterations showed validation accuracies of **68.57%** and **65.71%**.
  - **Current iteration** has improved to **77.14%** validation accuracy.

This upward trend indicates that the modifications made to the rules and the feature matrix are enhancing the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen validation data. The improved accuracy suggests that the current set of rules is more effective in capturing the underlying patterns that determine the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

**Analysis Based on the SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values help identify the contribution of each feature (rule) to the model's predictions. Analyzing these values provides insights into which rules are driving the predictions and where misclassifications may be occurring.

**Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

Several molecules were predicted to have high loading, whereas the experimental results showed low loading. The rules with the most significant positive SHAP values contributing to these overestimations are likely candidates for refinement.

1. **Molecule:** C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
   - **Rules Contributing to Overestimation:**
     - **Rule 5:** SHAP Value: **0.2802**
     - **Rule 10:** SHAP Value: **0.1631**
     - **Rule 3:** SHAP Value: **0.0566**

2. **Molecule:** C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O
   - **Rules Contributing to Overestimation:**
     - **Rule 10:** SHAP Value: **0.0792**
     - **Rule 5:** SHAP Value: **0.0073**
     - **Rule 3:** SHAP Value: **0.0606**

3. **Molecule:** C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O
   - **Rules Contributing to Overestimation:**
     - **Rule 10:** SHAP Value: **0.0515**
     - **Rule 5:** SHAP Value: **0.0495**
     - **Rule 3:** SHAP Value: **0.0240**

4. **Molecule:** C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O
   - **Rules Contributing to Overestimation:**
     - **Rule 5:** SHAP Value: **0.0758**
     - **Rule 10:** SHAP Value: **0.0591**
     - **Rule 3:** SHAP Value: **0.0526**

5. **Molecule:** C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)S
   - **Rules Contributing to Overestimation:**
     - **Rule 5:** SHAP Value: **0.0327**
     - **Rule 10:** SHAP Value: **0.0855**
     - **Rule 3:** SHAP Value: **0.0603**

**Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

There are fewer instances where the model underestimates the loading. However, one notable case is:

1. **Molecule:** C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O
   - Predicted high loading, but the experimental value is low, indicating overestimation rather than underestimation.

**Insights Gleaned from SHAP Analysis:**

- **Rule 5** consistently shows high positive SHAP values in cases of overestimation.
- **Rule 10** is intended to predict low yield but contributes positively to high loading predictions.
- **Rule 3** also shows significant positive SHAP values in overestimated cases.

These insights suggest that these rules may be overgeneralizing, misapplied, or require refinement to align with the experimental observations.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules:**

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

   - The current rules have increased the validation accuracy, indicating a positive impact on the model's predictive capabilities.
   - However, the misclassifications reveal that certain rules may not be accurately capturing the chemical nuances that determine modifier loading.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**

   - The model shows improved accuracy on the validation set without evidence of decreased performance on unseen data, suggesting that overfitting is not a significant issue at this stage.
   - The consistent overestimations point towards potential underfitting in capturing specific structural exceptions within the rules.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**

   - **Rule 5** and **Rule 10** are major contributors to overestimation, as they have high positive SHAP values in cases where the experimental loading is low.
   - **Rule 3** also contributes to overestimations but to a lesser extent.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

   - The increase in validation accuracy suggests that the current rules have improved the model but also highlight that refinement is necessary to address specific misclassifications.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Rule 5:**

   - **Current Issue:** Rule 5 may be too broad, leading to overestimations in molecules where the presence of aromatic rings separated from hydrophilic groups does not result in high yield.
   - **Suggested Refinement:**
     - Introduce constraints on the aliphatic chain length separating the aromatic ring from the hydrophilic group.
     - Consider the electronic properties of the substituents on the aromatic ring.
     - Exclude modifiers where additional steric hindrance or electronic factors negate the positive effect.

2. **Adjust Rule 10:**

   - **Current Issue:** Rule 10 is intended to predict low yield for modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid. However, it shows positive SHAP values, contributing to high loading predictions.
   - **Suggested Refinement:**
     - Verify the implementation of Rule 10 in the feature matrix to ensure it correctly corresponds to low yield.
     - Reassess the scope of the rule to differentiate between various types of ether linkages, perhaps only polyethers lead to low yield, whereas simple ether linkages might not have the same effect.
     - Consider adding exceptions for molecules where ether linkages are adjacent to other functional groups that enhance catalyst interaction.

3. **Reassess Rule 3:**

   - **Current Issue:** Rule 3 may be overgeneralizing by categorizing all amino acids with acidic side chains as leading to high yield.
   - **Suggested Refinement:**
     - Narrow the rule to specify which acidic side chains contribute positively, possibly focusing on aspartic and glutamic acids.
     - Exclude amino acids where the side chain's position or additional functional groups interfere with catalyst interaction.
     - Incorporate structural factors such as steric hindrance or electronic effects that may negate the positive influence.

4. **Incorporate Additional Structural Considerations:**

   - Evaluate the impact of **steric hindrance**, **electronic effects**, and **functional group interactions** that may override the general trends captured by the current rules.
   - Introduce new rules or modify existing ones to account for these factors, improving the model's specificity.

5. **Enhance Rule Specificity:**

   - For rules associated with high positive SHAP values in overestimations, add more specific criteria or exceptions to prevent overgeneralization.
   - Use cheminformatics tools to identify substructures or descriptors that better capture the modifiers' behavior.

6. **Validate Rule Implementation:**

   - Ensure that all rules are correctly encoded in the feature matrix and accurately reflect the intended predictions.
   - Cross-check the rules against a subset of molecules to verify their contributions align with chemical intuition.

7. **Iterative Model Evaluation:**

   - Continue using SHAP analysis to identify problematic rules in future iterations.
   - Use a systematic approach to adjust rules based on their impact on misclassifications.

8. **Consider Underrepresented Cases:**

   - Although underestimations are fewer, investigate any instances to prevent potential issues from arising as the model evolves.
   - Ensure that rules contributing negatively to high loading predictions are not excessively penalizing certain modifiers.

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules has improved the model's predictive accuracy but requires further refinement to enhance its reliability. By focusing on rules that contribute to misclassifications—particularly **Rule 5**, **Rule 10**, and **Rule 3**—we can adjust and fine-tune the model to better align with experimental observations. Implementing these recommendations should reduce overestimations, improve the model's generalization capabilities, and move closer to an optimal set of rules for predicting modifier loading on catalysts.

**Next Steps:**

- Revise the identified rules based on the suggestions.
- Re-encode the feature matrix with the updated rules.
- Retrain the model and evaluate its performance.
- Conduct another round of SHAP analysis to assess the impact of the changes.
- Repeat the iterative refinement process until the model's predictions align closely with experimental results.

**Summary and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules:**

Based on the detailed analysis provided, the current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction shows improvements in confidence and lift but a decrease in support. The validation accuracy has improved to 77.14%, indicating better generalization compared to previous iterations.

However, there are areas where the rules can be optimized to enhance their predictive power and applicability:

1. **Adjust Rule 1 (Unbranched Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids):**
   - **Issue:** The rule currently only returns `1` (high yield) or `0` (not high yield). It doesn't explicitly account for low-yield cases where modifiers have polar substituents or longer chain lengths (>8 carbons).
   - **Suggestion:** Modify the code to return `-1` for low-yield cases when polar substituents (hydroxyl, amino, ether groups) are present or when the chain length exceeds eight carbons. Improve branching detection by excluding the carboxyl carbon from the branching check and focusing on carbons connected to more than two carbon atoms.

2. **Enhance Polar Substituent Detection in Rule 1:**
   - **Issue:** The current method might not accurately identify all relevant polar functional groups.
   - **Suggestion:** Use specific SMARTS patterns to detect hydroxyl (`[OX2H]`), amino (`[NX3;H2,H1;!$(NC=O)]`), and ether groups (`[OD2]([#6])[#6]`). Exclude oxygens in the carboxyl group by using more precise matching.

3. **Expand Electron-Withdrawing Group Detection in Rule 2:**
   - **Issue:** Only nitro and bromomethyl groups are considered as EWGs at the para position.
   - **Suggestion:** Include other common EWGs such as cyano (`-C≡N`) and trifluoromethyl (`-CF₃`) groups by adding their SMARTS patterns. Ensure the code checks for these groups at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.

4. **Refine Electron-Donating Group Detection in Rule 2:**
   - **Issue:** The rule might incorrectly match substituents not in the para position or miss certain EDGs.
   - **Suggestion:** Use precise SMARTS patterns to detect EDGs at the para position, such as methyl and hydroxyl groups. Exclude the para-amino group as an exception that leads to high yield.

5. **Improve Amino Acid Matching in Rule 3:**
   - **Issue:** The SMARTS pattern may not capture all amino acids with acidic side chains.
   - **Suggestion:** Use a more accurate pattern that detects an α-amino acid backbone with an additional carboxyl group in the side chain, specific to aspartic and glutamic acids.

6. **Accurately Calculate Chain Length in Rule 4:**
   - **Issue:** Chain length between the amino group and carboxyl group may not be accurately computed.
   - **Suggestion:** Use `Chem.GetDistanceMatrix(mol)` to compute the shortest path and assign `1` for path lengths ≤5 carbons and `-1` for >5 carbons.

7. **Enhance Detection in Rule 5 (Hydrophilic Groups Separated by Aliphatic Chains):**
   - **Issue:** The SMARTS patterns may not accurately detect the modifiers as per the rule description.
   - **Suggestion:** Use SMARTS patterns that account for variations in chain lengths and different hydrophilic groups, ensuring accurate detection of the positive and negative cases.

8. **Differentiate Ring Connectivity in Rule 6:**
   - **Issue:** Need to distinguish between heteroaromatic rings directly connected to the carboxyl group and those connected via another ring.
   - **Suggestion:** Use precise SMARTS patterns to identify the nature of the ring system and connectivity.

9. **Improve Chain Length Calculation in Rule 7:**
   - **Issue:** Precise identification of thiol groups attached to short aliphatic chains is needed.
   - **Suggestion:** Use distance matrix calculations to determine the path length between the thiol sulfur and the carboxyl carbon.

10. **Revise SMARTS Patterns Across All Rules:**
    - **Issue:** Ensure accuracy in functional group detection.
    - **Suggestion:** Verify and test SMARTS patterns independently to ensure they match the intended substructures.

11. **Include Explicit Negative Cases in Code Logic:**
    - **Issue:** The code may default to `0` instead of `-1` in negative cases.
    - **Suggestion:** Update the code to explicitly assign `-1` where appropriate for low-yield predictions.

12. **Validate Feature Matrix Against Expected Outcomes:**
    - **Issue:** Potential discrepancies between feature values and expected outcomes.
    - **Suggestion:** Compare assigned feature values with expected values and adjust the code to improve accuracy.

13. **Consider Additional Structural Factors:**
    - **Issue:** Some rules may overgeneralize, leading to misclassifications.
    - **Suggestion:** Introduce considerations for steric hindrance, electronic effects, and functional group interactions that may influence the yield.

14. **Refinement Based on SHAP Analysis:**
    - **Issue:** Certain rules (e.g., Rule 5 and Rule 10) contribute to overestimation of high yield.
    - **Suggestion:** Adjust these rules by adding constraints or exceptions to prevent overgeneralization.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

Yes, there is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The analysis indicates that certain rules are overgeneralizing or not accurately capturing the chemical features that influence the yield. By refining these rules and improving the specificity of SMARTS patterns, we can enhance the model's predictive accuracy and applicability to a broader dataset.

Careful adjustments, such as expanding group detection, refining chain length calculations, and incorporating additional structural considerations, can improve the model without leading to overfitting. Cross-validation and iterative testing will ensure that the model maintains generalizability.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. However, **when the nitrogen-containing heterocycle is connected via an additional aromatic ring**, as in **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, the yield is **low**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. In contrast, **modifiers with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings**, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**. The abundance of hydroxyl groups may enhance interactions with the catalyst through hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds**, particularly those formed by acylation of amino acids or linking amino acid residues, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated alkyl chains** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may hinder effective coordination with the catalytic sites.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic aromatic side chains**, particularly those containing an indole ring, lead to **high yield**. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan). In contrast, **amino acids with less bulky aromatic side chains**, like **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to an aromatic ring within a fused lactone or ketone structure** lead to **high yield**. An example is **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**. The carbonyl groups may facilitate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains terminated with aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (C=O) groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**. The presence of these groups may interfere with catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents on the aliphatic chain**, such as methoxy groups or other large functional groups, tend to result in **high yield**. An example is **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**. The bulky groups may enhance binding affinity to the catalyst.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- ** Advice 1 **: **Adjust Rule 1** to return `-1` (low yield) when modifiers have polar substituents (hydroxyl, amino, or ether groups) or when the aliphatic chain length exceeds eight carbons. Exclude the carboxyl carbon from the branching check by focusing on carbons connected to more than two carbons (i.e., tertiary carbons) to improve branching detection.

- ** Advice 2 **: **Enhance Polar Substituent Detection in Rule 1** by using specific SMARTS patterns to identify polar functional groups:
  - Hydroxyl groups: `[OX2H]` (excluding carboxyl oxygens).
  - Amino groups: `[NX3;H2,H1;!$(NC=O)]` (excluding amides).
  - Ether groups: `[OD2]([#6])[#6]` (oxygen single-bonded to two carbons).
  Ensure these patterns exclude atoms in the carboxyl group to prevent false positives.

- ** Advice 3 **: **Expand Electron-Withdrawing Group Detection in Rule 2** by including additional EWGs at the para position, such as:
  - Cyano groups: `[$([NX1]#[CX2])]`.
  - Trifluoromethyl groups: `[$([CX4](F)(F)F)]`.
  Add their SMARTS patterns to detect these groups and update the code to check their position relative to the carboxyl group.

- ** Advice 4 **: **Refine Electron-Donating Group Detection in Rule 2** by accurately identifying EDGs at the para position:
  - Methyl groups: `[$([CH3])]`.
  - Hydroxyl groups: `[$([OH])]`.
  Use SMARTS patterns that specify the substituent's position on the aromatic ring and exclude the para-amino group exception, which should be coded to result in high yield.

- ** Advice 5 **: **Improve Amino Acid Matching in Rule 3** by using a SMARTS pattern that detects amino acids with acidic side chains:
  - Pattern for α-amino acids with an additional carboxyl group: `N[C@@H](C(=O)O)CC(=O)O`.
  This pattern specifically matches aspartic acid and glutamic acid, ensuring accurate detection.

- ** Advice 6 **: **Accurately Calculate Chain Length in Rule 4** by using `Chem.GetDistanceMatrix(mol)` to compute the shortest path between the amino nitrogen and the carboxyl carbon. Assign `1` (high yield) for path lengths of five or fewer carbons and `-1` (low yield) for longer chains.

- ** Advice 7 **: **Enhance Detection in Rule 5** by adjusting SMARTS patterns to detect hydrophilic groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) separated from aromatic rings by aliphatic chains:
  - Use patterns that account for varying chain lengths and types of hydrophilic groups.
  - Ensure the patterns differentiate between hydrophilic groups directly attached to the ring (low yield) and those separated by chains (high yield).

- ** Advice 8 **: **Differentiate Ring Connectivity in Rule 6** by using precise SMARTS patterns:
  - For heteroaromatic rings directly attached to the carboxyl group: `[n][c](:c):c:[c]:c:C(=O)O`.
  - For heteroaromatic rings connected via another aromatic ring (low yield): `[n][c]1:[c]:[c]:[c]:[c]1c2:c:c:c:c:c2C(=O)O`.
  Update the code to check for these specific patterns to accurately predict yield.

- ** Advice 9 **: **Improve Chain Length Calculation in Rule 7** by determining the path length between the thiol sulfur atom and the carboxyl carbon using the distance matrix. Identify modifiers where this path length is short (e.g., three carbons or fewer) and assign `1` (high yield), assigning `-1` (low yield) for longer paths or thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings.

- ** Advice 10 **: **Revise SMARTS Patterns Across All Rules** to ensure accurate functional group detection:
  - Verify each pattern independently.
  - Test patterns against known structures to confirm they match intended substructures and exclude unintended ones.
  - Update patterns to be as specific as necessary to prevent false positives and negatives.

- ** Advice 11 **: **Include Explicit Negative Cases in Code Logic** by:
  - Updating the code to assign `-1` (low yield) explicitly when conditions for low yield are met.
  - Ensuring that the default case is set appropriately (e.g., `0` for undecided cases) and that all possible scenarios are accounted for in the logic.

- ** Advice 12 **: **Validate Feature Matrix Against Expected Outcomes** by:
  - Comparing the assigned feature values for each compound with the expected yield outcomes from the dataset.
  - Identifying discrepancies and adjusting the code or patterns to correct misclassifications.
  - Re-evaluating the rules after adjustments to ensure improved accuracy.

- ** Advice 13 **: **Consider Additional Structural Factors** by:
  - Incorporating steric hindrance effects, such as bulky groups near the functional sites that may influence catalyst interaction.
  - Considering electronic effects beyond basic EWG and EDG classifications, such as resonance and inductive effects.
  - Adding new rules or modifying existing ones to account for these factors, backed by chemical reasoning.

- ** Advice 14 **: **Refine Rules Based on SHAP Analysis** by:
  - Analyzing which rules contribute most to misclassifications or overestimations of high yield.
  - Adjusting rules like Rule 5 and Rule 10 by adding specific constraints or exceptions to reduce overgeneralization.
  - Ensuring that the refinements are based on both data analysis and chemical intuition to improve model performance without overfitting.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and without polar substituents** tend to result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. Conversely, **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents**—such as hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH₂) groups—or with longer chains result in **low yield**. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position**, such as nitro (-NO₂) or bromomethyl (-CH₂Br), lead to **high yield**. Examples: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. In contrast, **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position**, like methyl (-CH₃) or hydroxyl (-OH), result in **low yield**. Examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. Notably, **para-amino (-NH₂) groups** are an exception and result in **high yield**, as seen with **4-aminobenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**, specifically those containing an additional carboxylic acid group beyond the alpha-carboxyl group, lead to **high yield**. Examples: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

- **Rule 4**: **Omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. In contrast, **omega-amino acids with longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield**. Examples: **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings connected to hydroxyl groups via aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. An example is **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**. Conversely, **modifiers with hydroxyl groups directly attached to the aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. Examples include **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

- **Rule 6**: **Heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. However, **modifiers where the nitrogen-containing ring is connected via an additional aromatic ring**, such as **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. In contrast, **modifiers with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings**, like **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain**, such as sugar acids, result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance coordination with the catalyst through hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains containing heterocycles**, especially the indole ring, lead to **high yield**. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan). Conversely, **amino acids with less bulky aromatic side chains**, like **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds**, particularly those formed by acylation of amino acids or linking amino acid residues, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially those with polyether chains, result in **low yield**. An example is **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated alkyl chains** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may reduce coordination ability with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with fused aromatic lactone structures containing multiple carbonyl groups** lead to **high yield**. An example is **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**. The presence of carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic systems may facilitate coordination with metal centers.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:
  
  Rule 1 is clear and allows for a straightforward determination of yield based on the chain length and the presence of polar substituents in unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids. It provides good physical-chemical insight into how the absence of polar groups and optimal chain lengths facilitate high yield, possibly due to favorable interactions with the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of structural features—chain length, branching, and substituents—indicating appropriate complexity. It is well-supported by multiple data points, including both high yield (e.g., octanoic acid) and low yield examples (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**:
  
  Rule 2 is clear in distinguishing the effects of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids on yield. The exception noted for para-amino groups adds necessary specificity. The rule provides valuable property insight into electronic effects on the reaction, suggesting that electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination with the catalyst. It demonstrates good complexity by considering both the aromatic system and substituent effects. Multiple data points support the rule, including high yield examples (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid) and low yield examples (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid), ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 3**:
  
  Rule 3 clearly states that amino acids with acidic side chains, containing an extra carboxylic acid group, lead to high yield. It offers sound property insight by highlighting how additional acidic groups may enhance chelation with the catalyst. The rule combines structural features of amino acids and the presence of extra carboxyl groups, demonstrating appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two data points—(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid—meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 4**:
  
  Rule 4 provides clarity by specifying that omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer result in high yield, while longer chains lead to low yield. It offers property insight into the influence of chain length on the reaction, possibly related to steric hindrance or solubility. The rule's complexity is appropriate, considering both chain length and functional group positioning. The coverage is strong, supported by data points such as high yield for 5-aminopentanoic acid and low yield for 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- **Comment 5**:
  
  Rule 5 is clear in its distinction between modifiers with hydroxyl groups connected via aliphatic chains versus those directly attached to aromatic rings. It provides property insight into the spatial arrangement of hydroxyl groups affecting catalyst interaction. The rule demonstrates complexity by involving multiple sub-structures—aromatic rings, aliphatic chains, and hydroxyl groups. Adequate coverage is achieved with supporting data points like high yield for 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and low yield for 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Comment 6**:
  
  Rule 6 clearly differentiates between heteroaromatic carboxylic acids based on the position of nitrogen atoms relative to the carboxyl group. It offers property insight into how nitrogen adjacency may enhance coordination with metal centers. The rule has appropriate complexity, considering the heteroaromatic ring structure and connectivity. It is well-supported by data points such as high yield for pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and low yield for 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 7**:
  
  Rule 7 provides clarity by specifying the effect of thiol group positioning on yield. It offers property insight into how thiol groups on short aliphatic chains may enhance catalyst interactions, while direct attachment to aromatic rings does not. The rule shows appropriate complexity by considering both the functional group and its position relative to the ring system. It is supported by data points, including high yield for 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid and low yield for 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 8**:
  
  Rule 8 is clear in stating that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield. It provides property insight by suggesting enhanced coordination through hydrogen bonding. However, the rule is supported by only one data point—(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid—limiting its coverage. While the rule demonstrates complexity and offers valuable insight, the low number of supporting data points reduces confidence in its general applicability.

- **Comment 9**:
  
  Rule 9 clearly addresses the influence of bulky hydrophobic side chains containing heterocycles in amino acids on yield. It provides property insight into how such side chains, particularly the indole ring, may enhance interactions with the catalyst. The rule demonstrates appropriate complexity by considering both the side chain size and the presence of heterocycles. It is supported by data points such as high yield for (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan) and low yield for (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 10**:
  
  Rule 10 is clear in stating that modifiers containing amide bonds tend to result in low yield. It provides property insight into how amide bonds may interfere with coordination or reactivity due to their electron-withdrawing nature or steric effects. The rule's complexity is appropriate, focusing on the presence of specific functional groups formed by acylation or peptide linkages. It is supported by multiple data points, including (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 11**:
  
  Rule 11 clearly states that modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid result in low yield. It offers property insight by suggesting that ether linkages may reduce coordination ability with the catalyst due to increased flexibility or shielding effects. However, the rule is supported by only one data point—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid—limiting its coverage. While the rule is specific and insightful, the lack of additional supporting data points weakens its general applicability.

- **Comment 12**:
  
  Rule 12 is clear in indicating that modifiers with highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated alkyl chains lead to low yield. It provides property insight into how strong electron-withdrawing effects may inhibit coordination with the catalyst. The rule demonstrates appropriate complexity by focusing on a specific functional group. However, it is supported by only one data point—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid—resulting in limited coverage. This reduces confidence in the rule's robustness across a broader range of modifiers.

- **Comment 13**:
  
  Rule 13 clearly identifies that modifiers with fused aromatic lactone structures containing multiple carbonyl groups result in high yield. It offers property insight into how such structures may facilitate coordination with metal centers due to the presence of electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic systems. The rule demonstrates complexity by considering a specific and intricate structural motif. However, the rule is supported by only one data point—1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid—limiting its coverage and generalizability.

An example is **octanoic acid**. Conversely, **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents**—such as hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH₂) groups—or with longer chains result in **low yield**. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position**, such as nitro (-NO₂) or bromomethyl (-CH₂Br), lead to **high yield**. Examples: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. In contrast, **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position**, like methyl (-CH₃) or hydroxyl (-OH), result in **low yield**. Examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. Notably, **para-amino (-NH₂) groups** are an exception and result in **high yield**, as seen with **4-aminobenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**, specifically those containing an additional carboxylic acid group beyond the alpha-carboxyl group, lead to **high yield**. Examples: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

- **Rule 4**: **Omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. In contrast, **omega-amino acids with longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield**. Examples: **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings connected to hydroxyl groups via aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. An example is **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**. Conversely, **modifiers with hydroxyl groups directly attached to the aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. Examples include **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

- **Rule 6**: **Heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. However, **modifiers where the nitrogen-containing ring is connected via an additional aromatic ring**, such as **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. In contrast, **modifiers with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings**, like **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain**, such as sugar acids, result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance coordination with the catalyst through hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains containing heterocycles**, especially the indole ring, lead to **high yield**. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan). Conversely, **amino acids with less bulky aromatic side chains**, like **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds**, particularly those formed by acylation of amino acids or linking amino acid residues, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially those with polyether chains, result in **low yield**. An example is **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated alkyl chains** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may reduce coordination ability with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with fused aromatic lactone structures containing multiple carbonyl groups** lead to **high yield**. An example is **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**. The presence of carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic systems may facilitate coordination with metal centers.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: In **Rule 1**, the `hydroxyl_group` SMARTS pattern `'[OX2H]'` incorrectly matches the hydroxyl oxygen in carboxylic acids, causing molecules like octanoic acid to be excluded. Modify the `hydroxyl_group` pattern to exclude the hydroxyl group of carboxylic acids by specifying that the hydroxyl oxygen should be attached to a carbon that is not a carbonyl. For example, use `'[OX2H][#6;!$(C=O)]'` to match hydroxyl groups attached to sp³-hybridized carbons excluding carbonyls.

- **Suggestion 2**: In **Rule 2**, the `para_substituted_benzene` pattern `'c1ccc([*])cc1'` is too generic and may not accurately capture para-substituted benzoic acids with specific functional groups. Refine this pattern to specifically target para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids. For example, use `'c1cc([$(\[NX3H2,NX3H1,NX3H0\]),$(\[NX3](=O)[O-]\),F,Cl,Br,I])ccc1C(=O)[OX2H1]'` to match a benzene ring with a para substituent (EWG or amino group) and a carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 3**: Ensure that the `include_patterns` in **Rule 2** properly capture electron-withdrawing groups and the para-amino group. Verify that the patterns for EWGs (e.g., nitro group `'[NX3](=O)[OX1-]'`) and amino groups are correctly defined and that they match substituents at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 4**: In **Rule 2**, consider using atom mapping to specify the positions of substituents on the aromatic ring. For example, define a pattern where the carboxylic acid and the substituent are at specific positions (positions 1 and 4) on the benzene ring.

- **Suggestion 5**: In **Rule 1**, adjust the `unbranched_aliphatic_chain` pattern to ensure it matches unbranched chains correctly. For example, explicitly define the chain length by counting the carbons and ensure the terminal carboxylic acid is included. Verify that the pattern matches molecules like octanoic acid.

- **Suggestion 6**: For **Rule 10**, the `amide_bond` pattern `'[CX3](=O)[NX3]'` may match amide bonds within amino acids, which could lead to incorrect assignments. Refine this pattern to target amide bonds formed by acylation or linking amino acid residues, perhaps by considering the context of the amide group in the molecule.

- **Suggestion 7**: For **Rules 4 and 5**, ensure that chain lengths and connections are accurately captured. For example, in **Rule 4**, specify that omega-amino acids should have a carboxylic acid at one end and an amino group at the omega position, with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer.

- **Suggestion 8**: Review and test each SMARTS pattern individually against known examples and counter-examples to ensure they accurately capture the intended structures. Make adjustments where patterns are either too narrow or too broad.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Simplify the rules by focusing on quantifiable molecular features directly derivable from SMILES strings. Identify key functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amino groups, hydroxyl groups) and encode their presence as binary variables (1 if present, 0 if absent).

- **Advice 2**: Consolidate rules that involve chain length and branching into a single, quantifiable parameter. For example, create a numerical feature for the aliphatic chain length and a separate feature indicating the degree of branching.

- **Advice 3**: Replace qualitative descriptors like "electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)" and "electron-donating groups (EDGs)" with quantitative electronic parameters such as Hammett sigma constants. Assign numerical values to substituents based on their electronic effects.

- **Advice 4**: Use molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), and the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. These descriptors can be calculated from SMILES and used as numerical features.

- **Advice 5**: Encode the presence of aromatic rings and heteroaromatic systems using numerical features. Include counts of aromatic carbons and nitrogen atoms within rings to capture the effect of aromaticity and heteroatoms on yield.

- **Advice 6**: Quantify steric effects by calculating molecular volume or using Verloop steric parameters. Incorporate these values into the rules to account for the impact of bulky substituents on catalyst coordination and reactivity.

- **Advice 7**: Implement molecular fingerprints (e.g., Morgan fingerprints) to numerically represent the structural features of modifiers. This allows for capturing complex structural information in a format suitable for machine learning models.

- **Advice 8**: Group modifiers into general classes based on their core structures (e.g., straight-chain aliphatic acids, branched-chain acids, aromatic acids, amino acids) and assign class identifiers as categorical features.

- **Advice 9**: Remove exceptions in the rules by incorporating additional quantifiable features that explain the outliers. For example, consider the resonance stabilization or specific interactions (like hydrogen bonding capacity) that certain substituents may provide.

- **Advice 10**: Develop new rules that are based on combinations of numerical features. Use statistical or machine learning methods to identify which features most significantly affect the yield and formulate rules accordingly.

- **Advice 11**: Use software tools to calculate electronic properties such as HOMO-LUMO gaps, partial charges, and dipole moments from the SMILES strings. Incorporate these electronic descriptors into the feature set to better capture the influence of electronic factors on the reaction yield.

- **Advice 12**: For modifiers containing functional groups that may interact with the catalyst (e.g., coordinating atoms like N, O, S), create features that count these atoms or calculate their spatial orientation relative to the carboxyl group, to quantify coordination potential.

- **Advice 13**: Streamline the rule set by removing overly specific cases and focusing on broader trends that are supported by the data. This will make the rules more generalizable and easier to apply to new modifiers.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**, specifically those containing an additional carboxylic acid group beyond the alpha-carboxyl group, result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups may enhance coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** lead to **high yield**. Examples are **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. Conversely, **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position** result in **low yield**—examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. An exception is **para-amino (-NH₂) substituted acids**, which give **high yield**, as seen with **4-aminobenzoic acid**. The amino group, while an EDG, can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing activity.

- **Rule 3**: **Omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. In contrast, **omega-amino acids with longer chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield**, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Shorter chains may favor better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain**, especially **sugar acids**, lead to **high yield**. Examples include **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**. Multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen) adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples are **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. The heteroatom near the carboxyl group can coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains containing heterocycles**, such as the indole ring, lead to **high yield**. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan). Bulky side chains may enhance interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with short aliphatic chains bearing thiol (-SH) groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. In contrast, **modifiers with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings** result in **low yield**, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. The thiol group on a flexible chain may better interact with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. Conversely, **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups) on longer chains** result in **low yield**. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Polar substituents may hinder the interaction with the catalyst due to steric or electronic factors.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers where functional groups are connected to an aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain** lead to **high yield**. Examples include **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**. Conversely, **modifiers with the same functional groups directly attached to the aromatic ring** result in **low yield**, such as **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**. The aliphatic linker may reduce steric hindrance and improve interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds**, particularly those formed by acylation of amino acids or linking amino acid residues, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples are **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. The amide linkage may reduce the availability of coordination sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially those with polyether chains, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. The ether oxygen may compete with the carboxylate for coordination, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing fused aromatic lactones or multiple carbonyl groups in an aromatic system** result in **high yield**. An example is **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**. The additional carbonyl groups may enhance metal coordination.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups**, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl chains, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers where a heteroaromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**. Conversely, **modifiers where the heteroaromatic ring is directly attached to the carboxylic acid**, and the heteroatom is not adjacent to the carboxyl group, result in **low yield**—for example, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. The aliphatic linker may facilitate better orientation for coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) functional groups** result in **low yield**. An example is **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**. The aldehyde group may interfere with the catalyst or undergo side reactions.

The rule effectively combines multiple structural features, providing acceptable complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is precise in predicting yield based on electron-withdrawing or donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids, and is backed by several data points (entries 1, 20, 22), including exceptions accounted for (entry 4). It offers solid property insight and acceptable complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 has clarity in correlating chain length of omega-amino acids with yield outcomes, supported by data (entries 3, 31, 34).

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules for Clarity**  
  Several rules in the current set overlap or are redundant. For instance, **Rule 5** and **Rule 14** both discuss heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with respect to the position of the heteroatom and its connection to the carboxyl group. Consolidate these rules to eliminate redundancy and improve clarity. A unified rule can more effectively capture the influence of heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group on yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Enhance Rules with Limited Data Support**  
  Some rules, such as **Rule 12** (modifiers containing fused aromatic lactones) and **Rule 15** (modifiers containing aldehyde groups), are based on a single data point. Strengthen these rules by gathering additional data or, if that's not feasible, consider merging them with related rules to increase their robustness. For example, combine **Rule 12** with rules discussing electron-withdrawing groups that enhance metal coordination.

- **Advice 3**: **Specify Structural Details in Broad Rules**  
  Rules like **Rule 8** (unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons) could be refined by specifying optimal chain lengths and highlighting the impact of chain branching and saturation. Adding details such as "straight-chain saturated fatty acids with 6 to 8 carbons result in high yield" can make the rule more precise and predictive.

- **Advice 4**: **Integrate Exceptions into Rule Frameworks**  
  In **Rule 2**, para-amino substituted acids are exceptions to the general trend of electron-donating groups leading to low yield. Create sub-rules or note exceptions within the rules to account for such anomalies. This will improve the rules' accuracy and help users understand when exceptions may occur.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Electronic and Steric Parameters**  
  Enhance the property insights by integrating electronic (e.g., Hammett sigma values) and steric parameters (e.g., Taft steric factors) into the rules. For example, specify that modifiers with strongly electron-withdrawing groups (σ > +0.7) at the para position lead to high yield. This quantitative approach can improve the rules' predictive power.

- **Advice 6**: **Reevaluate Rules with Conflicting Data**  
  Examine rules where exceptions or conflicting data points exist. For example, **Rule 13** mentions that modifiers with fluorinated groups result in low yield, but only limited data support this. Reassess such rules by analyzing additional data or considering whether the observed effect might be due to other structural factors.

- **Advice 7**: **Merge Rules Based on Common Mechanistic Insights**  
  Consider combining rules that share underlying mechanistic explanations. For instance, merge **Rule 7** (thiol groups on aliphatic chains) with **Rule 5** (heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group) under a broader rule about functional groups capable of coordinating with the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's effectiveness.

- **Advice 8**: **Address the Role of Molecular Flexibility**  
  Introduce new rules or modify existing ones to consider molecular flexibility and its impact on yield. For example, flexible linkers in modifiers might enhance interactions with the catalyst. This can be particularly relevant for modifiers with aliphatic chains connecting functional groups to aromatic systems.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Solubility Considerations**  
  Modify the rules to account for the solubility of modifiers in the reaction medium. Hydrophilic modifiers may have different effects on yield compared to hydrophobic ones due to their solubility in acetonitrile. This can be integrated into existing rules concerning polar substituents.

- **Advice 10**: **Use Computational Modeling for Validation**  
  Employ computational chemistry tools to model interactions between modifiers and the catalyst. This can validate the proposed rules, reveal insights into the molecular basis of high or low yields, and guide the refinement of rules based on theoretical predictions.

- **Advice 11**: **Expand the Dataset for Underrepresented Modifiers**  
  To improve the robustness of rules with limited coverage, such as those concerning fused aromatic lactones or aldehyde groups, expand the dataset by testing additional modifiers with these features. This will strengthen the statistical significance of the rules.

- **Advice 12**: **Standardize Descriptor Terminology**  
  Ensure consistency in the terminology used across all rules. For example, use standardized names for functional groups and consistently refer to chain lengths (e.g., specify "C5-C8" instead of "5 to 8 carbons"). This standardization will improve comprehension and application of the rules.

- **Advice 13**: **Consider the Influence of Catalyst Loading Parameters**  
  Since modifier/SBU ratio and Fe/Hf ratio impact the yield, consider integrating rules that relate structural features of modifiers to optimal catalyst loading conditions. For example, specify that certain modifiers may require adjusted Fe loading to achieve high yields.

- **Advice 14**: **Clarify the Scope and Limitations of Each Rule**  
  For each rule, explicitly mention any known limitations or the context in which the rule applies. This will help users understand the applicability of the rule and avoid misinterpretation when predicting yields for new modifiers.

- **Advice 15**: **Visual Aids for Structural Patterns**  
  Provide visual representations (e.g., diagrams or SMILES strings) of the key structural features described in the rules. Visual aids can enhance understanding and assist users in quickly identifying whether a new modifier fits a particular rule.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**, specifically those containing an additional carboxylic acid group beyond the alpha-carboxyl group, result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups may enhance coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** lead to **high yield**. Examples are **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. Conversely, **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position** result in **low yield**—examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. An exception is **para-amino (-NH₂) substituted acids**, which give **high yield**, as seen with **4-aminobenzoic acid**. The amino group, while an EDG, can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing activity.

- **Rule 3**: **Omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. In contrast, **omega-amino acids with longer chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield**, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Shorter chains may favor better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain**, especially **sugar acids**, lead to **high yield**. Examples include **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**. Multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen) adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples are **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. The heteroatom near the carboxyl group can coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains containing heterocycles**, such as the indole ring, lead to **high yield**. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan). Bulky side chains may enhance interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with short aliphatic chains bearing thiol (-SH) groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. In contrast, **modifiers with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings** result in **low yield**, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. The thiol group on a flexible chain may better interact with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. Conversely, **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups) on longer chains** result in **low yield**. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Polar substituents may hinder the interaction with the catalyst due to steric or electronic factors.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers where functional groups are connected to an aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain** lead to **high yield**. Examples include **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**. Conversely, **modifiers with the same functional groups directly attached to the aromatic ring** result in **low yield**, such as **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**. The aliphatic linker may reduce steric hindrance and improve interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds**, particularly those formed by acylation of amino acids or linking amino acid residues, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples are **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. The amide linkage may reduce the availability of coordination sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially those with polyether chains, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. The ether oxygen may compete with the carboxylate for coordination, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing fused aromatic lactones or multiple carbonyl groups in an aromatic system** result in **high yield**. An example is **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**. The additional carbonyl groups may enhance metal coordination.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups**, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl chains, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers where a heteroaromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**. Conversely, **modifiers where the heteroaromatic ring is directly attached to the carboxylic acid**, and the heteroatom is not adjacent to the carboxyl group, result in **low yield**—for example, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. The aliphatic linker may facilitate better orientation for coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) functional groups** result in **low yield**. An example is **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**. The aldehyde group may interfere with the catalyst or undergo side reactions.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 2**, modify the code to specifically check for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) or electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the **para position** relative to the carboxylic acid on the aromatic ring. Use SMARTS patterns that can identify substituents at the para position, such as using the `[*]c1ccc([$(EWG),$(EDG)])cc1C(=O)O` pattern, where `[$(EWG)]` and `[$(EDG)]` represent the SMARTS for EWGs and EDGs respectively. Additionally, include the low yield prediction for molecules with EDGs at the para position.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For **Rule 3**, adjust the SMARTS pattern to match omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of **five carbons or fewer**, not just exactly five carbons. Use a pattern like `[NX3;H2][CH2]{1,5}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` to allow for variable chain lengths from one to five carbons.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 5**, correct the SMARTS pattern to accurately match **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** where the **heteroatom is adjacent to the carboxyl group**. Ensure that the pattern accounts for different ring sizes and positions, such as `[nX2][c,n]([c,n])[c,n][c,n][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`, to capture both five- and six-membered heteroaromatic rings.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For **Rule 6**, refine the SMARTS pattern to specifically capture **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains containing heterocycles**, like the indole ring in tryptophan. Use patterns that identify side chains with fused aromatic heterocycles attached to the alpha carbon, such as `[CX4;!H0][C](=[OX1])[OX2H1][C][c]1c[cH]c2c1cccc2`.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For **Rule 8**, modify the code to match **unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons**. Use a SMARTS pattern like `[CH3][CH2]{3,6}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` to allow for chain lengths within the specified range. Also, ensure that the molecule does not contain additional functional groups by excluding patterns for hydroxyl, amino, and other polar groups.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For **Rule 9**, adjust the SMARTS pattern to accurately represent modifiers where **functional groups are connected to an aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain**, ensuring the functional group is not directly attached to the ring. A possible pattern is `[c][CH2][*(functional_group)]`, where `*(functional_group)` represents the SMARTS of the specific functional group connected through a chain.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For **Rule 11**, refine the SMARTS pattern to better capture modifiers with **ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, including polyether chains. Use recursive SMARTS or repetition patterns like `[CX3](=O)[OX2][CH2][OX2][CH2][OX2][CH2]` to match multiple connected ether groups.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For **Rule 12**, generalize the SMARTS pattern to match various **fused aromatic lactones** or aromatic systems with **multiple carbonyl groups**. Instead of a specific structure, use patterns like `[$(c1ccc2c(c1)C(=O)OC2=O)]` to include different fused ring systems with the required functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For **Rule 13**, expand the SMARTS pattern to include **perfluoroalkyl chains** and other highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups. Use patterns like `[CX4][CF2][CF2][CF3]` or `[CX4][CF3]` to match longer perfluoroalkyl chains in addition to trifluoromethyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For **Rule 2**, implement the detection of **low yield** when the molecule has **electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position**. Include SMARTS patterns for common EDGs like hydroxyl (`[OH]`), methoxy (`[OCH3]`), or amino groups (`[NH2]`) at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group, and set the prediction to -1 in these cases.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Review and correct any SMARTS patterns that are **too general** and may cause **false positives**, such as patterns in **Rule 5** matching benzene derivatives without heteroatoms. Ensure that each pattern accurately reflects the specific structural requirements of the rule.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Implement more precise **positional matching** in SMARTS patterns where necessary, such as **ortho**, **meta**, and **para positions** in aromatic rings. This can be achieved by using SMARTS patterns with ring bond counting or by specifying the relative positions of substituents on the ring.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Ensure that the code handles the **exceptions** specified in the rules, such as the **para-amino (-NH₂) substituted acids** in **Rule 2**, and that both **high and low yield predictions** are implemented where applicable.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: For rules involving **counts of specific functional groups** (e.g., hydroxyl groups in **Rule 4**), check that the count patterns accurately reflect the required thresholds and do not produce false matches due to overlapping substructures. Use methods to count non-overlapping matches of the functional groups.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

**Overview**

Upon reviewing the current set of rules and their associated metrics, particularly focusing on confidence and lift, we observe both improvements and areas that may require further refinement. The comparison with the previous rule metrics provides valuable insights into the performance trajectory of our rule set.

---

**1. Comparison of Current Metrics with Previous Metrics**

**Previous Metrics (Baseline Reference):**

- **Train Support:** Average of approximately 0.1756
- **Train Confidence:** Average of approximately 0.5874
- **Train Lift:** Average of approximately 1.1304
- **Train Leverage:** Average of approximately 0.0124

**Current Metrics:**

- **Train Support:** 0.0648
- **Train Confidence:** 0.6832
- **Train Lift:** 1.3624
- **Train Leverage:** 0.0152

**Observations:**

- **Increase in Confidence:** The current train confidence has increased from an average of ~0.5874 to 0.6832. This indicates a higher proportion of times the rule predictions are correct when the rule conditions are met.
  
- **Increase in Lift:** The current train lift has improved from an average of ~1.1304 to 1.3624. A lift greater than 1 suggests that the rule's predictive power is better than random chance, and the higher the lift, the stronger the association.

- **Decrease in Support:** The current train support has decreased from an average of ~0.1756 to 0.0648, meaning the rules now cover a smaller portion of the dataset.

- **Slight Increase in Leverage:** The train leverage has marginally increased from ~0.0124 to 0.0152, suggesting a slightly stronger association than expected by chance.

---

**2. Interpretation of the Metrics**

- **Confidence and Lift Improvements:**
  - The increase in confidence and lift indicates that the current rules are more accurate when they apply. The predictions these rules make are more reliable, and the association between the rule conditions and the outcomes is stronger.
  
- **Trade-off with Support:**
  - The decrease in support signifies that while the rules are more accurate, they apply to fewer instances in the dataset. This could be due to the rules becoming too specific, capturing niche patterns that do not occur frequently.

- **Leverage Analysis:**
  - The positive leverage, which has slightly increased, suggests that the rules have a meaningful association beyond what would be expected by chance, although the magnitude is still relatively small.

---

**3. Potential Implications**

- **Risk of Overfitting:**
  - The decrease in support coupled with the increase in confidence and lift might indicate that the rules are overfitting to the training data, capturing specific instances rather than generalizable patterns.
  
- **Generalizability Concerns:**
  - With lower support, there's a risk that the rules may not perform as well on unseen data, as they do not cover a broad range of instances.

---

**4. Recommendations for Improvement**

- **Balance Specificity and Generality:**
  - **Adjust Rule Conditions:** Review the conditions of the current rules to identify opportunities to generalize them slightly. This could involve relaxing overly strict conditions that limit the applicability of the rules.
  
- **Increase Support Without Compromising Confidence Significantly:**
  - **Combine Similar Rules:** Identify rules with similar conditions and outcomes that could be merged to increase support.
  - **Broaden Rule Scope:** Slightly widen the criteria of certain rules to cover more instances while monitoring the impact on confidence and lift.

- **Validate Against Test Data:**
  - **Test Set Evaluation:** Assess the rules using a test dataset to evaluate their performance on unseen data. This will help determine if the high confidence and lift are maintained and if overfitting is a concern.

- **Iterative Refinement:**
  - **Continue Iterations:** Since the metrics indicate improvements but also highlight areas for enhancement, further iterations may be beneficial. Focus on increasing support while maintaining acceptable levels of confidence and lift.

- **Explore Additional Features:**
  - **Feature Engineering:** Consider incorporating additional relevant features or modifying existing ones to capture broader patterns that could enhance rule applicability.

---

**5. Conclusion**

The current rules have demonstrated improved confidence and lift compared to the previous metrics, indicating stronger and more reliable associations when the rules apply. However, the decrease in support suggests that these rules cover fewer instances, potentially limiting their overall utility and generalizability.

To address this, a balanced approach is recommended—aim to increase the support of the rules by generalizing them slightly, ensuring they apply to a broader portion of the data without significantly compromising confidence and lift. This can enhance the usefulness of the rules in practical applications and mitigate the risk of overfitting.

Further iterations focused on these improvements, coupled with validation using test data, will help in determining whether a local minimum has been reached or if additional refinements can yield better-performing rules.

---

**Next Steps:**

- Review and adjust the current rules to find opportunities for generalization.
- Validate the performance of the current rules on a test dataset.
- Continue iterative development, monitoring changes in support, confidence, lift, and leverage.
- Collaborate with the team to share insights and integrate feedback into rule refinement.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Comments on Accuracies of the Validation Set and Training Set:**

Based on the provided data, the performance of the classification model using the current set of rules has declined compared to previous iterations. Specifically:

- **Current Validation Accuracy:** The model achieved an accuracy of **0.6286** in the 5-fold cross-validation. 
- **Previous Validation Accuracies:** Earlier validations showed higher accuracies, consistently around **0.76** to **0.77**.

This decline suggests that the current rules are less effective in capturing the underlying patterns that differentiate high-loading and low-loading modifiers.

---

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into how each rule influences the model's predictions. Key observations from the SHAP analysis are:

1. **Rule 10 Dominance in Mispredictions:**
   - For several molecules where the **predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low**, **Rule 10** has the most significant positive SHAP value for high loading.
   - Examples include:
     - **C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
     - **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O**
     - **C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN**

2. **Lack of Counteracting Rules:**
   - There are no notable rules with significant negative SHAP values to counterbalance the overestimation caused by Rule 10 in these cases.
   - This indicates that Rule 10 is disproportionately influencing the model towards predicting high loading.

---

**Evaluation of Current Rules Effectiveness:**

1. **Effectiveness Assessment:**
   - The **current rules are not sufficiently effective**, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy and the dominance of mispredictions associated with Rule 10.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - **Underfitting Concern:** The lower validation accuracy suggests that the model may be underfitting, failing to capture the complexity of the data.
   - **Over-Reliance on Specific Rules:** The model's heavy reliance on Rule 10 hints at a lack of balance in the rule set, possibly contributing to both underfitting and overfitting in different aspects.

3. **Discrepancy Analysis:**
   - **Problematic Rule Identified:** Rule 10 is systematically contributing to incorrect high-loading predictions where experimental values are low.
   - **Impact on Predictions:** The high positive SHAP values of Rule 10 for mispredicted molecules highlight it as a key area for improvement.

4. **Accuracy Metrics Interpretation:**
   - **No Improvement Evident:** The decrease from previous accuracies (~0.76) to the current accuracy (~0.63) indicates that recent iterations have not improved the model.
   - **Potential Local Minimum:** The stagnation or decline in performance may suggest that the current approach has reached a local minimum in terms of rule optimization.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - **Rule 10's Influence is Misaligned:** Given that Rule 10 is intended to associate modifiers containing amide bonds with **low yield**, its strong positive SHAP values for high loading are contradictory.
   - **Possible Misimplementation:** There may be an issue with how Rule 10 is implemented in the feature matrix, leading to incorrect contributions to the model's predictions.

---

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules:**

- The current rules, particularly Rule 10, are **not adequately capturing the relationship** between molecular features and the loading of modifiers on the catalyst.
- **Consistency Issues:** The inconsistency between Rule 10's intended purpose (associating amide-containing modifiers with low yield) and its actual influence on the model (contributing to high loading predictions) indicates a misalignment.
- **Need for Rule Refinement:** The observations suggest that without refining the problematic rules, the model's performance is unlikely to improve.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Review and Refine Rule 10:**
   - **Correct Encoding Issues:**
     - Ensure that **Rule 10** is correctly implemented in the feature matrix.
     - Verify that modifiers containing amide bonds are appropriately associated with **low yield** in the feature representation.
   - **Adjust Rule Directionality:**
     - If Rule 10 is intended to decrease the likelihood of high loading, its formulation should contribute negative weights towards high-loading predictions.
   - **Specificity Enhancement:**
     - Consider making Rule 10 more specific to certain types of amide bonds or molecular contexts where the association with low yield is strongest.
   - **Examples Re-evaluation:**
     - Re-assess the examples used to define Rule 10 to ensure they accurately reflect the intended chemical rationale.

2. **Balance the Rule Set:**
   - **Introduce Counteracting Rules:**
     - Develop new rules to counterbalance any overemphasis caused by existing rules, particularly for molecules that are currently mispredicted.
   - **Ensure Complementarity:**
     - Confirm that rules collectively cover the diversity of the dataset without redundancy or conflict.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - **Avoid Overfitting to Specific Cases:**
     - Refine rules to generalize better across different molecular structures, avoiding overfitting to specific examples in the training set.
   - **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features:**
     - Consider including new molecular descriptors or features that capture relevant chemical properties not currently accounted for.

4. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights:**
   - **Identify Other Problematic Rules:**
     - Examine other rules that may have high positive SHAP values in mispredictions or high negative SHAP values in underpredictions.
   - **Adjust Rule Weights:**
     - Fine-tune the influence of individual rules based on their impact on predictions, as indicated by SHAP values.
   - **Validate Changes with Cross-Validation:**
     - After making adjustments, re-evaluate the model using cross-validation to ensure that changes lead to performance improvements.

5. **Enhance Model Complexity if Necessary:**
   - **Consider Model Complexity:**
     - If underfitting persists, it may be beneficial to increase the complexity of the model, allowing it to capture more intricate patterns.
   - **Regularization Techniques:**
     - Apply regularization methods to prevent overfitting if model complexity is increased.

6. **Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation:**
   - **Track Performance Metrics:**
     - Monitor changes in validation accuracy and SHAP values after each iteration to assess the impact of refinements.
   - **Set Performance Goals:**
     - Establish target accuracy levels to guide the iterative improvement process.

---

**Conclusion:**

By focusing on refining Rule 10 and carefully adjusting the rule set based on insights from the SHAP analysis, we can improve the model's performance. Ensuring that the rules accurately represent the underlying chemistry and are correctly implemented in the feature matrix is crucial. An iterative approach of testing and validating changes will help in achieving a more accurate and generalizable model for predicting the loading of modifiers on the catalyst.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

The current set of rules aims to predict the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction by analyzing the structural features of molecular modifiers. The discussions have highlighted several key points regarding the performance and optimization of these rules:

1. **Improvement in Confidence and Lift but Reduced Support**: The current rules show increased confidence (from ~58.7% to ~68.3%) and lift (from ~1.13 to ~1.36), indicating stronger associations when the rules apply. However, the support has decreased (from ~17.6% to ~6.5%), meaning the rules cover fewer instances in the dataset. This suggests the rules may have become too specific, potentially overfitting to the training data.

2. **Dominance of Rule 10 in Misclassifications**: SHAP analysis indicates that **Rule 10** is disproportionately influencing the model towards predicting high yield even when the experimental yield is low. This contradicts the intended purpose of Rule 10, which is to associate modifiers containing amide bonds with **low yield**.

3. **Decrease in Validation Accuracy**: The validation accuracy has declined from previous iterations (from ~76% to ~62.9%), suggesting that the current set of rules may not effectively capture the patterns necessary for accurate predictions.

4. **Need for Rule Refinement**: There are discrepancies between some rules' intended purposes and their actual influence on the model's predictions. This highlights the necessity to review and refine the rules to ensure they align correctly with the chemical principles they are meant to represent.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Review and Correct Rule 10**:
   - **Issue**: Rule 10 is intended to predict **low yield** for modifiers containing amide bonds but is contributing to **high yield** predictions.
   - **Action**: Re-express the SMARTS pattern for Rule 10 to accurately identify amide groups and ensure the rule is coded to predict **low yield** (-1) when matched. Verify that the rule implementation reflects this association both in the code and the feature matrix.

2. **Generalize Overly Specific Rules to Increase Support**:
   - **Rule 2 (Electron-Withdrawing/Dongating Groups)**:
     - **Issue**: The current pattern may not accurately differentiate between EWGs and EDGs at the para position.
     - **Action**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to specifically detect EWGs (e.g., nitro, halogens) and EDGs (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy, amino) at the **para position**. Use positional descriptors in SMARTS to target the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

   - **Rule 3 (Omega-Amino Acids)**:
     - **Issue**: The rule may be too narrow, focusing only on specific chain lengths.
     - **Action**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to match omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of **one to five carbons**, increasing the range of molecules captured by this rule.

3. **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Accuracy**:
   - **Rule 5 (Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids)**:
     - **Issue**: The SMARTS pattern may not accurately capture heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group.
     - **Action**: Update the SMARTS pattern to ensure it matches rings where the heteroatom (e.g., nitrogen) is directly attached to the ring position adjacent to the carboxyl group.

   - **Rule 8 (Unbranched Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids)**:
     - **Issue**: The pattern might include molecules with unwanted functional groups.
     - **Action**: Use exclusion patterns in SMARTS to prevent matching molecules with additional polar substituents like hydroxyl or amino groups.

4. **Implement Positional Specificity in Aromatic Rings**:
   - **Issue**: Existing patterns may not differentiate between ortho, meta, and para substitutions.
   - **Action**: Incorporate ring traversal and counting in SMARTS patterns to specify substituent positions on aromatic rings, enhancing the accuracy of rules like Rule 2.

5. **Address Exceptions Explicitly**:
   - **Rule 2 Exception (Para-Amino Substituted Acids)**:
     - **Issue**: Para-amino groups are exceptions that result in high yield despite being EDGs.
     - **Action**: Add specific SMARTS patterns for para-amino substituents that predict **high yield**, ensuring exceptions are correctly handled.

6. **Review and Adjust Rule Influence**:
   - **Issue**: Certain rules may be overly influential, leading to misclassifications.
   - **Action**: Introduce or adjust rules to balance the overall model. For instance, ensure rules predicting low yield are not overshadowed by those predicting high yield in cases where they should apply.

7. **Enhance Rule Coverage Without Overfitting**:
   - **Issue**: Decreased support suggests rules are too narrow.
   - **Action**: Slightly generalize rules to cover more molecules. For example:
     - Broaden functional group definitions where appropriate.
     - Combine similar rules to increase support while maintaining confidence.

8. **Validate SMARTS Patterns Against Known Examples**:
   - **Issue**: Incorrect SMARTS patterns may cause mismatches.
   - **Action**: Test each SMARTS pattern against known molecules to confirm they match intended structures and do not produce false positives or negatives.

9. **Use Counts of Functional Groups Carefully**:
   - **Issue**: Overlapping substructures may inflate counts.
   - **Action**: Employ methods to count non-overlapping occurrences of functional groups, ensuring accurate representation of molecular features (e.g., the number of hydroxyl groups in Rule 4).

10. **Iteratively Validate and Refine Rules**:
    - **Action**: After implementing changes, perform cross-validation and SHAP analysis to assess the impact of adjustments. Continue refining based on performance metrics until improvements plateau.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is a strong possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By correcting misimplementations, refining SMARTS patterns, and balancing rule influences, we can enhance model performance while maintaining generalizability. Careful adjustments will prevent overfitting by ensuring the rules are neither too specific nor too general.

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**, specifically those containing an additional carboxylic acid group beyond the alpha-carboxyl group, result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups may enhance coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** lead to **high yield**. Examples are **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. Conversely, **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position** result in **low yield**—examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. An exception is **para-amino (-NH₂) substituted acids**, which give **high yield**, as seen with **4-aminobenzoic acid**. The amino group, while an EDG, can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing activity.

- **Rule 3**: **Omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. In contrast, **omega-amino acids with longer chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield**, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Shorter chains may favor better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain**, especially **sugar acids**, lead to **high yield**. Examples include **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**. Multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen) adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples are **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. The heteroatom near the carboxyl group can coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains containing heterocycles**, such as the indole ring, lead to **high yield**. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan). Bulky side chains may enhance interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with short aliphatic chains bearing thiol (-SH) groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. In contrast, **modifiers with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings** result in **low yield**, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. The thiol group on a flexible chain may better interact with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. Conversely, **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups) on longer chains** result in **low yield**. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Polar substituents may hinder the interaction with the catalyst due to steric or electronic factors.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers where functional groups are connected to an aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain** lead to **high yield**. Examples include **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**. Conversely, **modifiers with the same functional groups directly attached to the aromatic ring** result in **low yield**, such as **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**. The aliphatic linker may reduce steric hindrance and improve interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds**, particularly those formed by acylation of amino acids or linking amino acid residues, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples are **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. The amide linkage may reduce the availability of coordination sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially those with polyether chains, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. The ether oxygen may compete with the carboxylate for coordination, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing fused aromatic lactones or multiple carbonyl groups in an aromatic system** result in **high yield**. An example is **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**. The additional carbonyl groups may enhance metal coordination.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups**, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl chains, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers where a heteroaromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**. Conversely, **modifiers where the heteroaromatic ring is directly attached to the carboxylic acid**, and the heteroatom is not adjacent to the carboxyl group, result in **low yield**—for example, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. The aliphatic linker may facilitate better orientation for coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) functional groups** result in **low yield**. An example is **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**. The aldehyde group may interfere with the catalyst or undergo side reactions.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Review and Correct Rule 10**
  - **Issue**: Rule 10, intended to predict **low yield** for modifiers containing amide bonds, is incorrectly influencing the model towards predicting **high yield**.
  - **Action**: 
    - **Re-express the SMARTS pattern** for Rule 10 to accurately identify amide functional groups. Ensure the pattern specifically matches amide bonds within the modifiers.
    - **Verify Rule Implementation**: Confirm that the rule is correctly coded to predict **low yield** (-1) when the SMARTS pattern matches. This includes checking the sign of the rule's contribution in the feature matrix and updating any associated coefficients.

- **Advice 2**: **Modify Rule 2 for Accurate Detection of EWGs and EDGs**
  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS patterns may not properly differentiate between electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the **para position** of aromatic carboxylic acids.
  - **Action**: 
    - **Update SMARTS Patterns**:
      - For **EWGs** at the para position (predict **high yield**), include groups like nitro (`-NO₂`), halogens (`-F`, `-Cl`, `-Br`), and cyano (`-CN`).
      - For **EDGs** at the para position (predict **low yield**), include groups like hydroxyl (`-OH`), methoxy (`-OCH₃`), and methyl (`-CH₃`).
    - **Implement Positional Specificity**:
      - Use SMARTS notation to specify the **para position** relative to the carboxylic acid group on the aromatic ring.
    - **Handle Exceptions**:
      - Add a separate SMARTS pattern for **para-amino (-NH₂) substituents** that predicts **high yield**, acknowledging this exception due to the amino group's ability to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Advice 3**: **Generalize Rule 3 for Omega-Amino Acids**
  - **Issue**: Rule 3 is too narrow, focusing only on omega-amino acids with five or fewer carbons, reducing its support.
  - **Action**: 
    - **Adjust Chain Length Range**:
      - Modify the SMARTS pattern to match omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of **one to five carbons**. This increases the number of modifiers matched by the rule.
    - **Ensure Specificity**:
      - Verify that the pattern does not unintentionally include amino acids with longer chains or additional functional groups.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rule 5 for Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids**
  - **Issue**: The SMARTS pattern may not accurately capture heteroaromatic rings with heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group.
  - **Action**: 
    - **Update SMARTS Patterns**:
      - Ensure the pattern matches heteroaromatic rings (such as pyridine, pyrazole) where a heteroatom (e.g., nitrogen) is directly bonded to the ring carbon adjacent to the carboxylate group.
    - **Exclude Non-Adjacent Heteroatoms**:
      - Modify the pattern to prevent matching rings where the heteroatom is not adjacent to the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 5**: **Refine Rule 8 by Excluding Additional Functional Groups**
  - **Issue**: Rule 8 may include modifiers with polar substituents, which should result in **low yield**, conflicting with the rule's intention.
  - **Action**: 
    - **Incorporate Exclusion Patterns**:
      - Add SMARTS subpatterns to exclude modifiers that have additional polar substituents (e.g., hydroxyl `-OH`, amino `-NH₂`, thiol `-SH`) on the aliphatic chain.
    - **Focus on Unsubstituted Chains**:
      - Ensure the rule only matches **unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids** with chain lengths of **5 to 8 carbons** and **no other functional groups**.

- **Advice 6**: **Implement Positional Specificity in Aromatic Ring Substitutions**
  - **Issue**: Current SMARTS patterns may not accurately identify substituent positions (ortho, meta, para) on aromatic rings.
  - **Action**: 
    - **Utilize Advanced SMARTS Notation**:
      - Incorporate ring traversal and atom counting to specify substituent positions.
      - For example, use patterns like `[$(c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[OX1H])]` for para-substituted benzoic acids.
    - **Apply to Relevant Rules**:
      - Update Rules 2, 9, and any other rules involving aromatic substitutions to include positional specificity.

- **Advice 7**: **Explicitly Address Exceptions in Rules**
  - **Issue**: Some modifiers are exceptions to general trends (e.g., para-amino substituents in Rule 2).
  - **Action**: 
    - **Create Specific Rules for Exceptions**:
      - Add new rules or modify existing ones to handle exceptions explicitly.
      - For para-amino substituents, implement a rule that predicts **high yield** when a para-amino group is present on an aromatic carboxylic acid.
    - **Ensure Exceptions Do Not Conflict with General Rules**:
      - Adjust rule priorities or contributions to prevent exceptions from being overridden by general rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Balance Rule Influence to Prevent Misclassifications**
  - **Issue**: Some rules may be disproportionately influencing predictions, leading to errors.
  - **Action**: 
    - **Review Rule Contributions**:
      - Use model interpretation tools (e.g., SHAP values) to assess the impact of each rule.
    - **Adjust Rule Weights**:
      - Modify the coefficients associated with each rule to balance their influence.
    - **Introduce New Rules if Necessary**:
      - If certain patterns are causing misclassifications, consider adding new rules that counterbalance these effects.

- **Advice 9**: **Increase Rule Support by Slightly Generalizing Patterns**
  - **Issue**: Decreased support indicates that rules may be too specific.
  - **Action**: 
    - **Broaden Functional Group Definitions**:
      - Where appropriate, expand the range of functional groups included in a rule.
    - **Combine Similar Rules**:
      - Merge rules that cover similar structural features to increase support while maintaining predictive power.
    - **Avoid Over-Generality**:
      - Ensure that generalization does not lead to a significant drop in confidence or introduction of false positives.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate SMARTS Patterns Against Known Modifiers**
  - **Issue**: Incorrect SMARTS patterns can lead to misclassification of modifiers.
  - **Action**: 
    - **Test Patterns Systematically**:
      - Apply each SMARTS pattern to a set of known high-yield and low-yield modifiers to check for correct matches.
    - **Identify and Correct Mismatches**:
      - Adjust patterns that either miss intended matches or incorrectly match unintended structures.

- **Advice 11**: **Ensure Accurate Counting of Functional Groups**
  - **Issue**: Overlapping substructures in SMARTS patterns may inflate counts, affecting rules like Rule 4 (multiple hydroxyl groups).
  - **Action**: 
    - **Use Non-Overlapping Counts**:
      - Implement counting methods that avoid overlapping matches, possibly using recursive SMARTS or specialized software functions.
    - **Verify Counts with Examples**:
      - Cross-check the counts produced by the SMARTS patterns with actual counts in known molecules.

- **Advice 12**: **Iteratively Validate and Refine Rules**
  - **Issue**: Adjustments need to be tested to ensure they improve model performance without overfitting.
  - **Action**: 
    - **Perform Cross-Validation**:
      - Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the impact of rule changes.
    - **Analyze Model Performance Metrics**:
      - Monitor accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics after each iteration.
    - **Use Model Interpretation Tools**:
      - Continue using SHAP analysis to understand the influence of each rule.
    - **Refine Until Performance Plateaus**:
      - Repeat the process of refinement until additional changes no longer yield significant improvements.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**, specifically those containing an additional carboxylic acid group beyond the alpha-carboxyl group, result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups may enhance coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** lead to **high yield**. Examples are **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. Conversely, **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position** result in **low yield**—examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. An exception is **para-amino substituted acids**, which give **high yield**, as seen with **4-aminobenzoic acid**. The amino group, while an EDG, can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing activity.

- **Rule 3**: **Omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. In contrast, **omega-amino acids with longer chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield**, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Shorter chains may favor better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain**, especially **sugar acids**, lead to **high yield**. Examples include **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**. Multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst. In contrast, **modifiers with single hydroxyl groups on longer aliphatic chains** result in **low yield**, such as **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen) adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples are **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. The heteroatom near the carboxyl group can coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with short aliphatic chains bearing thiol (-SH) groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. In contrast, **modifiers with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings** result in **low yield**, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. The thiol group on a flexible chain may better interact with the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: **Unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. Conversely, **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups) on longer chains** result in **low yield**. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Polar substituents may hinder the interaction with the catalyst due to steric or electronic factors.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds**, particularly those formed by acylation of amino acids or linking amino acid residues, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples are **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. The amide linkage may reduce the availability of coordination sites.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups**, such as perfluoroalkyl chains, result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially those with polyether chains, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. The ether oxygen may compete with the carboxylate for coordination, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where functional groups are connected to an aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain** lead to **high yield**. Examples include **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**. Conversely, **modifiers with the same functional groups directly attached to the aromatic ring** result in **low yield**, such as **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**. The aliphatic linker may reduce steric hindrance and improve interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers where a heteroaromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**. Conversely, **modifiers where the heteroaromatic ring is directly attached to the carboxylic acid**, and the heteroatom is not adjacent to the carboxyl group, result in **low yield**—for example, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. The aliphatic linker may facilitate better orientation for coordination.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:
  
  Rule 1 is clear and straightforward to apply, as it focuses on amino acids with acidic side chains containing an additional carboxylic acid group beyond the alpha-carboxyl group. The rule provides physical-chemical insight by suggesting that the presence of two carboxyl groups may enhance coordination with the metal center, potentially increasing the yield. It considers combinations of sub-structures—the amino acid backbone and the extra carboxyl group—adding complexity. The rule is supported by at least two data points: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, both resulting in high yield, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 2**:
  
  Rule 2 is clear in its application, requiring the identification of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) or electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids. The exception for para-amino substitutions is well-explained, enhancing clarity. The rule provides physical-chemical insight into how EWGs may enhance yield, possibly due to electronic effects influencing metal coordination, while EDGs generally lead to low yield unless they can coordinate with the metal center (e.g., amino groups). It considers combinations of sub-structures and electronic effects, adding complexity. The rule has good coverage, supported by multiple data points: high yields for 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, low yields for 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and an exception with high yield for 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Comment 3**:
  
  Rule 3 is clear, focusing on omega-amino acids and their aliphatic chain lengths. It provides physical-chemical insight by suggesting that shorter chains may favor better interaction with the catalyst, enhancing yield. The rule considers chain length in combination with functional groups, adding complexity. It is supported by data points showing high yield for 5-aminopentanoic acid and low yields for 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid, indicating good coverage.

- **Comment 4**:
  
  Rule 4 is clear in identifying modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains, particularly sugar acids. The rule offers physical-chemical insight by proposing that multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst. It considers combinations of functional groups (multiple hydroxyls on an aliphatic chain), adding complexity. The rule is supported by data showing high yields for (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid, and low yield for 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 5**:
  
  Rule 5 is clear and easy to apply, focusing on heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group. It provides physical-chemical insight by indicating that heteroatoms near the carboxyl group can enhance coordination with the metal center. The rule considers the combination of heteroaromatic rings and the position of heteroatoms, adding complexity. It has good coverage, supported by high yields for pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Comment 6**:
  
  Rule 6 is clear in distinguishing between modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains and those with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings. It provides physical-chemical insight by suggesting that the flexibility of short aliphatic chains bearing thiol groups may facilitate better interaction with the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of functional groups and their attachment to different structures, adding complexity. It is supported by data showing high yield for 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid and low yield for 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, indicating good coverage.

- **Comment 7**:
  
  Rule 7 is clear, specifying unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids of chain lengths between 5 and 8 carbons without additional functional groups. It provides physical-chemical insight by suggesting that polar substituents on longer chains may hinder interaction with the catalyst due to steric or electronic factors. The rule considers chain length, branching, and the presence or absence of functional groups, adding complexity. It is supported by high yield for octanoic acid and low yields for 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 8**:
  
  Rule 8 is clear in identifying modifiers containing amide bonds, particularly those formed by acylation of amino acids or linking amino acid residues. It provides physical-chemical insight by suggesting that the amide linkage may reduce the availability of coordination sites, leading to low yield. The rule considers the presence of specific functional groups and their impact on coordination, adding complexity. It is supported by data showing low yields for (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid and 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, indicating good coverage.

- **Comment 9**:
  
  Rule 9 is clear in identifying modifiers with highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups, such as perfluoroalkyl chains. It provides physical-chemical insight by proposing that strong electron-withdrawing effects may reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with the metal center. However, the rule is based on a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), resulting in low coverage. This limits the strength of the rule despite its clarity and insight.

- **Comment 10**:
  
  Rule 10 is clear, focusing on modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid, especially with polyether chains. It provides physical-chemical insight by suggesting that ether oxygens may compete with the carboxylate for coordination, reducing efficacy. The rule considers specific structural features and their impact on coordination, adding complexity. It is supported by at least two data points—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid—both resulting in low yield, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 11**:
  
  Rule 11 is relatively clear in distinguishing between modifiers where functional groups are connected to an aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain versus directly attached. It provides physical-chemical insight by suggesting that an aliphatic linker may reduce steric hindrance and improve interaction with the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of functional groups and their attachment modes, adding complexity. It has good coverage, supported by high yields for 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid, and low yields for 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid.

- **Comment 12**:
  
  Rule 12 is moderately clear, focusing on modifiers where a heteroaromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain versus directly attached, and considering the position of the heteroatom. It provides physical-chemical insight by suggesting that an aliphatic linker may facilitate better orientation for coordination. The rule considers combinations of structural features and attachment patterns, adding complexity. However, the coverage is limited, with only one data point supporting each case (high yield for 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid and low yield for 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), resulting in low coverage.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: Transform the qualitative descriptions in the current rules into quantifiable molecular features that can be extracted from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups lead to high yield" (Rule 4), define a numerical feature such as "Number of hydroxyl groups" which can be directly counted from the SMILES representation.

- **Advice 2**: Replace vague terms like "short" or "long" aliphatic chains with specific numerical thresholds. For instance, in Rules 3 and 7, define "Aliphatic chain length" as the number of carbon atoms in the longest continuous chain and specify the exact number (e.g., chains with ≤5 carbons lead to high yield).

- **Advice 3**: Quantify electronic effects by assigning numerical values to substituents based on their Hammett sigma constants or other electronic parameters. This makes Rule 2 (regarding electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups) measurable and allows for the creation of a "Substituent electronic effect" feature.

- **Advice 4**: Introduce positional indicators for substituents on aromatic rings. Create numerical features that capture the position of substituents (e.g., ortho = 1, meta = 2, para = 3) to refine Rule 2 and allow for computational analysis of positional effects.

- **Advice 5**: Consolidate overlapping rules to reduce complexity and redundancy. Merge similar rules (e.g., Rules 3 and 7 regarding chain length and functional groups on aliphatic chains) into a unified rule that can be represented by quantifiable features.

- **Advice 6**: For functional groups capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, thiol groups), create binary or count-based features indicating their presence or number. This quantifies the coordination potential mentioned in several rules.

- **Advice 7**: Utilize cheminformatics tools to calculate molecular descriptors such as LogP (hydrophobicity), topological polar surface area (TPSA), molecular weight, and the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. These descriptors can capture steric and electronic properties relevant to the reaction yield.

- **Advice 8**: Represent ring systems numerically by including features like "Number of aromatic rings", "Number of heteroaromatic rings", and "Presence of specific heteroatoms in rings (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen)". This aids in quantifying Rules 5 and 12.

- **Advice 9**: Implement software algorithms (using tools like RDKit) to parse SMILES strings and automatically compute the proposed numerical features for each modifier. This ensures consistency and scalability in data processing.

- **Advice 10**: Develop a comprehensive feature matrix by standardizing the set of molecular descriptors across all modifiers. This matrix should include all relevant features extracted from the SMILES, facilitating advanced data analysis and machine learning modeling to predict reaction yields.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups**, such as **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid), result in **high yield**. The extra carboxylate group may enhance coordination with the metal center, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** lead to **high yield**. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. Conversely, **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position** result in **low yield**—examples are **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. EWGs increase the acidity and coordinate better with the metal center.

- **Rule 3**: **Omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. In contrast, **omega-amino acids with longer chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield**, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Shorter chains may facilitate better interaction due to reduced steric hindrance.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain**, especially **sugar acids**, lead to **high yield**. Examples include **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**. Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples are **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. The proximity of heteroatoms (like nitrogen) aids in coordinating with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. In contrast, **modifiers with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings** result in **low yield**, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. Aliphatic thiols have greater flexibility for coordination.

- **Rule 7**: **Unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic chain may enhance interaction with the catalyst's active site.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with amide bonds**, particularly those linking amino acids or functional groups, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples are **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. The amide linkage may hinder coordination due to reduced electron density on the nitrogen.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect diminishes coordination ability.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially polyether chains, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may compete with carboxylate for metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where functional groups are connected to an aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain** lead to **high yield**. Examples include **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**. The aliphatic linker reduces steric hindrance, allowing better interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl or amino groups on long aliphatic chains (more than six carbons)** result in **low yield**. Examples are **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. The polar groups on long chains may interfere with catalyst binding.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating heteroatoms** result in **low yield**. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine). The absence of coordinating groups reduces interaction with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan). The indole nitrogen can coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers where two aromatic rings are directly connected without flexible linkers** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. Lack of flexibility may hinder optimal coordination geometry.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and specifies that amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups result in high yield. It provides physical-chemical insight by attributing the enhanced yield to improved coordination with the metal center due to the extra carboxylate group. The complexity is appropriate, combining amino acid structure with functional groups. Coverage is adequate, supported by two data points: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**, both yielding high results.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** attempts to correlate electronic effects of substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids with yield outcomes. While the rule is clear in distinguishing between EWGs and EDGs at the para position, there is a contradiction with the dataset. **4-aminobenzoic acid**, which contains an EDG, results in a high yield (**True**), contrary to the rule's prediction. This discrepancy challenges the clarity and validity of the rule. Although the physical-chemical insight about EWGs enhancing coordination is reasonable, the rule lacks consistency and may require refinement or additional exceptions to improve clarity and accuracy.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear, stating that omega-amino acids with chains of five carbons or fewer lead to high yield, while longer chains result in low yield. The rule provides physical-chemical insight by suggesting reduced steric hindrance facilitates better interaction. The complexity is suitable, considering chain length and functional groups. Coverage is good, with supporting data from **5-aminopentanoic acid** (high yield), **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid** (both low yield).

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** clearly identifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain, especially sugar acids, lead to high yield. The rule's physical-chemical insight links multiple hydroxyl groups to enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination. Complexity is moderate, considering combinations of functional groups. Coverage is adequate with two supporting data points: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**, both resulting in high yield.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear and states that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield. The physical-chemical insight is strong, as heteroatoms can coordinate with the metal center. The complexity is acceptable, focusing on specific structural features. Coverage is strong, with three data points: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, all yielding high results.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** clearly distinguishes between thiol groups on short aliphatic chains and those attached to aromatic rings. The rule provides physical-chemical insight by explaining that aliphatic thiols offer greater flexibility for coordination. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is sufficient with two data points: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (high yield) and **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (low yield).

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear, stating that unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons result in high yield. The physical-chemical insight suggests hydrophobic chains enhance interaction with the catalyst. However, the coverage is limited to a single data point, **octanoic acid** (high yield). The lack of additional supporting data reduces the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly indicates that modifiers with amide bonds tend to result in low yield. The rule provides physical-chemical insight by attributing reduced yield to hindered coordination due to the amide linkage. Complexity is appropriate, considering specific functional groups. Coverage is adequate with two data points: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, both yielding low results.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear but lacks sufficient coverage, being based on a single data point: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (low yield). While the physical-chemical insight regarding the electron-withdrawing effect of perfluoroalkyl groups is sound, more data points are needed to strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** clearly states that modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight suggests ether oxygens may compete with carboxylate for metal coordination. Complexity is appropriate, involving combinations of functional groups. Coverage is adequate with two data points: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**, both yielding low results.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is somewhat complex but clear, indicating that modifiers where functional groups are connected to an aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain lead to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable, suggesting reduced steric hindrance allows better interaction. Coverage is limited to two data points: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**, both yielding high results.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** is clear, stating that modifiers with hydroxyl or amino groups on long aliphatic chains (more than six carbons) result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, proposing that polar groups on long chains may interfere with catalyst binding. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is adequate with two data points: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, both yielding low results.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** clearly states that amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating heteroatoms result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable, suggesting lack of coordinating groups reduces interaction. However, coverage is limited to a single data point: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (low yield), reducing confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** is clear and provides physical-chemical insight by indicating that amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms result in high yield. The complexity is acceptable. Yet, coverage is limited to one data point: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (high yield), which weakens the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is clear, stating that modifiers where two aromatic rings are directly connected without flexible linkers result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight is plausible, suggesting rigidity hinders optimal coordination geometry. However, coverage is limited to a single data point: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (low yield), which diminishes the rule's strength.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Revise Rule 2 to Account for Exceptions with Para-Amino Substituents**

  - **Issue**: Rule 2 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position result in low yield. However, **4-aminobenzoic acid**, which has a para-amino group (an EDG), results in a **high yield**, contradicting the rule.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Update Rule 2 to include an exception for para-amino groups. While amino groups are EDGs, the lone pair on the nitrogen can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Revised Rule 2 could read:

    > **Rule 2 Revised**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position lead to high yield. Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position result in low yield, **except for para-amino groups**, which result in high yield due to their ability to coordinate with the metal center.*

- **Advice 2**: **Improve Clarity and Consistency in Rules Regarding Electron Donating and Withdrawing Groups**

  - **Issue**: The current rules may oversimplify the effects of substituents by categorizing them solely as EWGs or EDGs without considering their coordination ability.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Emphasize the ability of substituents to coordinate with the metal center rather than only their electronic nature. For instance, hydroxyl (-OH) groups are EDGs but may hinder coordination due to hydrogen bonding with solvent or catalyst sites, leading to low yield. Clarify this in the rules to enhance understanding.

- **Advice 3**: **Consolidate Rules Involving Chain Length and Functional Groups on Aliphatic Chains**

  - **Issue**: Rules 3, 7, and 12 separately address the effects of chain length and functional groups on aliphatic chains, leading to redundancy.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Merge these rules into a single, comprehensive rule:

    > **Combined Rule**: *Unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and without additional polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups) result in high yield. Introducing polar substituents or extending the chain length beyond eight carbons leads to low yield due to increased steric hindrance and reduced catalyst interaction.*

- **Advice 4**: **Increase Data Support for Rules with Limited Coverage**

  - **Issue**: Some rules are based on a single or few data points (e.g., Rules 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 15), reducing their reliability.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Collect additional experimental data to strengthen these rules or, if data collection is not feasible, acknowledge the limited data support and consider these rules as tentative until more evidence is available.

- **Advice 5**: **Refine Rules Involving Aromatic Rings and Functional Group Positioning**

  - **Issue**: Rules regarding the position of functional groups relative to aromatic rings (Rules 5 and 11) may benefit from clearer distinctions.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Specify the importance of spatial arrangement and steric factors. For example, emphasize that an aliphatic linker between an aromatic ring and a functional group reduces steric hindrance and allows better alignment for metal coordination.

- **Advice 6**: **Clarify the Role of Heteroatoms in Modifiers**

  - **Issue**: Rules involving heteroatoms (Rules 5 and 14) could provide more detail on how different heteroatoms affect yield.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Distinguish between the types of heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) and their positions in the molecule. Explain how these atoms' lone pairs participate in coordination with the metal center, influencing catalytic activity.

- **Advice 7**: **Address Contradictions in Rules Involving Electronic Effects**

  - **Issue**: Some rules (e.g., Rule 2) inconsistently predict outcomes based on electronic effects.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Incorporate both electronic and steric factors into the rules. Recognize that while electronic effects are significant, the ability of functional groups to coordinate with the metal center and the overall molecule's geometry also play critical roles.

- **Advice 8**: **Include SMILES-Based Structural Patterns for Precision**

  - **Issue**: The current rules are descriptive and may benefit from more precise definitions.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Integrate SMILES notation or substructure patterns to define the modifiers unambiguously. This approach will aid in the rapid identification and screening of potential modifiers based on computational searches.

- **Advice 9**: **Enhance Physical-Chemical Insights Across Rules**

  - **Issue**: Some rules lack detailed explanations of the underlying reasons affecting yield.
  
  - **Suggestion**: For each rule, provide a brief rationale that includes factors such as steric hindrance, electronic effects, coordination ability, and hydrogen bonding. This will improve the understanding and predictive power of the rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Reevaluate Rules with Limited Practical Impact**

  - **Issue**: Rules based on very specific or rare structural features (e.g., Rule 13 and 15) may have limited applicability.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Consider combining such rules with others or rephrasing them to capture a broader range of modifiers. Alternatively, indicate that these rules are exceptions or special cases within a larger context.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups**, such as **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid), result in **high yield**. The extra carboxylate group may enhance coordination with the metal center, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** lead to **high yield**. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. Conversely, **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position** result in **low yield**—examples are **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. EWGs increase the acidity and coordinate better with the metal center.

- **Rule 3**: **Omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. In contrast, **omega-amino acids with longer chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield**, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Shorter chains may facilitate better interaction due to reduced steric hindrance.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain**, especially **sugar acids**, lead to **high yield**. Examples include **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**. Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples are **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. The proximity of heteroatoms (like nitrogen) aids in coordinating with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. In contrast, **modifiers with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings** result in **low yield**, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. Aliphatic thiols have greater flexibility for coordination.

- **Rule 7**: **Unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic chain may enhance interaction with the catalyst's active site.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with amide bonds**, particularly those linking amino acids or functional groups, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples are **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. The amide linkage may hinder coordination due to reduced electron density on the nitrogen.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect diminishes coordination ability.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially polyether chains, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may compete with carboxylate for metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where functional groups are connected to an aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain** lead to **high yield**. Examples include **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**. The aliphatic linker reduces steric hindrance, allowing better interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl or amino groups on long aliphatic chains (more than six carbons)** result in **low yield**. Examples are **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. The polar groups on long chains may interfere with catalyst binding.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating heteroatoms** result in **low yield**. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine). The absence of coordinating groups reduces interaction with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan). The indole nitrogen can coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers where two aromatic rings are directly connected without flexible linkers** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. Lack of flexibility may hinder optimal coordination geometry.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: **Complete the Implementation of All Rules**  
  Currently, the code only implements Rules 1 and 2. To make the transformation effective, implement the remaining rules (Rules 3 to 15) by defining their SMARTS patterns and logic in the code. This will ensure that the feature matrix fully captures all the specified rules.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Review and Enhance SMARTS Patterns for Rule 1**  
  The SMARTS patterns for Rule 1 may not comprehensively capture "amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups".  
  - **Issue**: The pattern `'[NX3H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]'` matches the amino acid backbone but may miss amino acids where the side chain contains the extra carboxyl group in various positions.
  - **Improvement**: Modify the pattern to match amino acids with an extra carboxyl group in the side chain, regardless of its position. Consider using recursive SMARTS or substructure searches that account for side chains with carboxyl groups.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine Patterns and Logic for Rule 2**  
  The code for Rule 2 may not accurately detect all EWGs and EDGs at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids.
  - **Issue 1**: The current `ewg_patterns` do not include carbonyl groups like aldehydes (–CHO) or ketones, which are considered EWGs.
  - **Improvement 1**: Add patterns such as `'[c][CX3H0](=O)'` to detect aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings.
  - **Issue 2**: The positional specificity (para position) is not enforced in the patterns.
  - **Improvement 2**: Incorporate positional constraints in the SMARTS patterns to ensure the substituents are at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. Use SMARTS such as `'c1cc([$(a1aaa[EWG])])ccc1C(=O)O'` where `[EWG]` represents the EWG patterns.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Expand EWG and EDG Pattern Lists**  
  The lists of EWGs and EDGs are currently limited.
  - **Issue**: Essential functional groups mentioned in the rules may not be included in the patterns (e.g., formyl groups, additional carboxyl groups, nitro groups on heteroaromatics).
  - **Improvement**: Expand `ewg_patterns` and `edg_patterns` to include all relevant groups cited in the rules. Ensure groups like –NO₂, –CHO, –COOH, –CN (EWGs), and –OH, –OCH₃, –NH₂ (EDGs) are included.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Handle Heteroaromatic Compounds Appropriately**  
  Some molecules involve heteroaromatic rings which may not be matched by the current patterns.
  - **Issue**: Patterns like `'[c][CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]'` may not match heteroaromatic carboxylic acids.
  - **Improvement**: Adjust patterns to include heteroaromatic systems. For example, use `[$(a)][CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]` where `a` represents any aromatic atom, including heteroatoms.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Ensure Correct Matching of Positional Isomers**  
  Positional isomerism is critical in Rule 2 (para position).
  - **Issue**: Without specifying positions, ortho or meta substituents may incorrectly match.
  - **Improvement**: Use SMARTS expressions that define the para relationship between the carboxyl group and the substituent. For example, use ring traversal patterns or specify the count of atoms between substituents.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Improve Error Handling and Molecule Parsing**  
  Ensure robust parsing of SMILES and error handling.
  - **Issue**: Molecules that cannot be parsed result in a row of zeros, which may not be informative.
  - **Improvement**: Log parsing errors with identifiers of the SMILES strings that fail. Consider using `Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi, sanitize=False)` and sanitizing separately to catch errors.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Validate the SMARTS Patterns Against Known Examples**  
  Before applying the patterns, test them against molecules with known outcomes.
  - **Issue**: Without validation, patterns may not work as intended.
  - **Improvement**: Use a set of test SMILES strings for which the expected rule matches are known to verify that the patterns and logic correctly identify them.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Document the Code Thoroughly**  
  Add comments and explanations in the code for clarity.
  - **Issue**: Without clear documentation, future maintenance or updates may be challenging.
  - **Improvement**: Provide detailed comments explaining the purpose of each SMARTS pattern, logic blocks, and any assumptions made.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Consider Using Functional Group Libraries**  
  To avoid errors in writing SMARTS, consider using existing libraries.
  - **Issue**: Manually writing complex SMARTS patterns is error-prone.
  - **Improvement**: Use RDKit's built-in functional group definitions or external libraries like SMARTS patterns from open-source repositories to ensure accuracy.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**Comparison with Previous Metrics:**

1. **Train Support:**
   - **Previous:** Mean values of approximately 0.1667 and 0.1845.
   - **Current:** 0.1143.
   - **Interpretation:** The current train support has decreased compared to previous iterations. This indicates that the proportion of records where both the rule conditions and the rule predictions are true has slightly diminished. While a lower support means the rules apply to fewer instances, it isn't necessarily detrimental if compensated by higher confidence.

2. **Train Confidence:**
   - **Previous:** Mean values of approximately 0.6352 and 0.5396.
   - **Current:** 0.8333.
   - **Interpretation:** There is a significant increase in train confidence in the current iteration. This suggests that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of correctly predicting the outcome is much higher than before. High confidence indicates that the rules are more reliable for predicting the target outcome when applied.

3. **Train Lift:**
   - **Previous:** Mean values of approximately 1.2048 and 1.0559.
   - **Current:** 1.6204.
   - **Interpretation:** The lift has substantially increased, which is a positive sign. A lift greater than 1 suggests that the rule is useful in predicting the outcome, and a higher lift indicates a stronger association between the rule conditions and the predictions. The current lift suggests that the rule conditions increase the probability of the prediction by 62.04% compared to random chance.

4. **Train Leverage:**
   - **Previous:** Values ranging from approximately 0.0289 to -0.0041.
   - **Current:** 0.0335.
   - **Interpretation:** The positive leverage value has increased, indicating a stronger association between the rule conditions and the predictions than expected by chance. A higher leverage suggests that the rule captures more cases than would occur randomly, contributing additional predictive power.

---

**Determination of Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency:**

- **Improvements Observed:**
  - **Confidence and Lift:** The significant increases in both confidence and lift imply that the current rules are more effective at correctly predicting high-yield outcomes when the rule conditions are met.
  - **Leverage:** The increase in leverage confirms that these rules are capturing associations not due to random chance, enhancing their value.

- **Support Trade-off:**
  - While confidence and lift have improved, the decrease in support suggests the rules are becoming more specific, covering fewer instances. This specificity can be advantageous if the rules are targeting the most critical factors influencing high yield but may limit generalizability.

- **Local Minimum Assessment:**
  - Given that improvements are still being observed in key metrics (confidence and lift), it is unlikely that a local minimum has been reached. However, the diminishing returns in support and potential overfitting should be monitored.
  - The increase in confidence and lift, coupled with the modest increase in leverage, suggests that further iterations might still yield beneficial refinements.

---

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Broaden Rule Conditions to Increase Support:**
   - **Action:** Re-evaluate the rules to identify overly restrictive conditions that could be relaxed without significantly compromising confidence.
   - **Rationale:** Increasing support will allow the rules to apply to a wider range of instances, enhancing their practical utility.

2. **Validate on Test Data:**
   - **Action:** Apply the current rules to a test dataset to evaluate their performance outside the training data.
   - **Rationale:** High performance on training data alone may indicate overfitting. Testing will ensure the rules generalize well and maintain high confidence and lift.

3. **Analyze Individual Rule Contributions:**
   - **Action:** Assess each rule's individual metrics (support, confidence, lift) to identify which rules are most effective.
   - **Rationale:** Focusing on refining or combining the most impactful rules can improve overall performance.

4. **Simplify Complex Rules:**
   - **Action:** Simplify rules that are too complex or highly specific.
   - **Rationale:** Simpler rules are often more generalizable and easier to interpret, which can help in increasing support while maintaining acceptable confidence levels.

5. **Investigate Decreasing Support:**
   - **Action:** Explore the reasons behind the decreasing support by examining the data distribution and rule conditions.
   - **Rationale:** Understanding whether the decrease is due to data sparsity or overly stringent rule conditions can guide adjustments to improve support.

6. **Monitor for Overfitting:**
   - **Action:** Regularly compare performance metrics between training and validation/test sets.
   - **Rationale:** Ensuring similar performance across datasets will confirm that the rules are not overfitting to the training data.

7. **Incorporate Domain Expertise:**
   - **Action:** Collaborate with domain experts to validate the logical consistency and plausibility of the rules.
   - **Rationale:** Expert insights can help refine rules based on chemical principles, potentially uncovering factors that metrics alone might miss.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current iteration of rules demonstrates significant improvements in confidence and lift, indicating enhanced predictive capabilities for high-yield outcomes. However, the reduced support suggests that the rules may have become too specialized, potentially limiting their applicability. To improve the current rules:

- **Focus on Increasing Support:** By carefully relaxing certain rule conditions, we can broaden the applicability of the rules without substantially sacrificing confidence.
- **Ensure Generalizability:** Validate the rules against test data to confirm that they perform well beyond the training dataset.
- **Balance Complexity and Utility:** Strive for a set of rules that are both powerful and broadly applicable, avoiding overfitting while maintaining high predictive accuracy.

Continued iterative refinement, guided by both metric analysis and domain expertise, will help in developing a robust set of rules that effectively predict high-yield catalytic outcomes.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Comparison with Previous Iterations:**

- **Previous Validation Accuracies:** The validation accuracies in previous iterations consistently hovered around **0.76**, with test accuracies of **0.75** and occasionally dropping to **0.625**.
- **Current Validation Accuracy:** In the latest iteration, the validation accuracy has decreased to **0.6286**, which is significantly lower than previous values.

**2. Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

- The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules, particularly **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**, may not be effectively capturing the relationship between molecular features and catalyst loading.
- **Rule 1** and **Rule 2** appear to contribute to incorrect predictions, as evidenced by the SHAP analysis.

**3. SHAP Analysis and Discrepancies:**

- **Underestimations (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**
  - Molecules such as **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N** and **C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)** were predicted to have low loading, but experimentally have high loading.
  - **SHAP Values:** Both **Rule 1** and **Rule 2** have significant negative SHAP values for these molecules, pulling the prediction toward low loading.
- **Overestimations (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**
  - Molecules like **C1=CC(=C(C=C1C=O)C(=O)O)O** and **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)S** were predicted to have high loading, but experimentally have low loading.
  - **SHAP Values:** **Rule 2** has a strong positive SHAP value in these cases, contributing to overestimation.

**4. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

- The decrease in validation accuracy, coupled with the inconsistent predictions, suggests that the model may be **underfitting**. The current rules are not generalizing well to the validation set.
- **Overfitting** is less likely since the validation accuracy is decreasing rather than the training accuracy being significantly higher than the validation accuracy.

**5. Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics:**

- The fluctuation and overall decrease in accuracy metrics indicate that the addition of **Rule 1** and **Rule 2** may not have improved the model.
- The model's predictive performance has degraded, suggesting that these rules may need refinement.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rule 2:**

- **Issue Identified:** **Rule 2** is contributing to overestimations due to its strong positive SHAP values in cases where the predicted loading is high but the experimental loading is low.
- **Suggested Action:**
  - **Specificity Enhancement:** Narrow down **Rule 2** to specify which electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) truly enhance catalyst loading. Not all EWGs may have the same impact.
  - **Context Consideration:** Consider the position of the substituents and their overall electronic effect on the molecule. Para substitutions may not be sufficient criteria.
  - **Modify Rule Statement:**
    - From: “Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position lead to high yield.”
    - To: “Aromatic carboxylic acids with specific EWGs (e.g., nitro, cyano) that significantly increase acidity lead to high yield, while others may not have the same effect.”

**2. Adjust Rule 1:**

- **Issue Identified:** **Rule 1** has negative SHAP values contributing to underestimations in molecules where the experimental loading is high.
- **Suggested Action:**
  - **Broaden Rule Scope:** Expand **Rule 1** to include amino acids with side chains that may not only have additional carboxyl groups but also other coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxyl groups).
  - **Re-evaluate Examples:** Assess whether the examples provided truly represent the entire category or if exceptions exist.

**3. Incorporate Additional Rules:**

- **Address Underfitting:**
  - Introduce new rules that capture other structural features influencing catalyst loading.
  - Consider rules based on molecular descriptors such as steric hindrance, overall polarity, or the presence of multiple coordinating sites.

**4. Improve Generalization:**

- **Reduce Overfitting to Specific Instances:**
  - Ensure that the rules are not overly specific to particular molecules but capture general chemical principles.
  - Validate rules against a diverse set of molecules to test their robustness.

**5. Utilize SHAP Insights for Rule Refinement:**

- **Pattern Recognition:**
  - Identify patterns in the SHAP values where certain functional groups or structural motifs consistently lead to incorrect predictions.
- **Iterative Evaluation:**
  - After modifying the rules, re-run the model and SHAP analysis to assess the impact of changes.

**6. Consider Rule Interaction Effects:**

- **Evaluate Synergistic Effects:**
  - Investigate if combinations of rules lead to unexpected results due to interactions.
  - Modify rules to account for such interactions, possibly by creating combined features or interaction terms.

**Conclusion**

The current rules, particularly **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**, appear to be insufficient in accurately predicting catalyst loading across the dataset, as indicated by decreased validation accuracy and inconsistent predictions. Refining these rules by making them more specific, considering additional molecular features, and continuously evaluating their performance through SHAP analysis can improve the model’s predictive capability. By addressing both overestimations and underestimations through targeted adjustments, the rules can be made more robust and generalizable, reducing underfitting and enhancing overall model performance.

**Summary and Directions for Optimizing the Current Rules**

**Summary of Discussions:**

In the previous analysis, several issues were identified with the current set of rules used to predict the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on the modifiers' SMILES structures:

1. **Incomplete Rule Implementation:** Only **Rules 1 and 2** have been implemented in the code, leaving out **Rules 3 to 15**. This omission limits the model's ability to capture the full range of structural features that influence catalytic activity and yield.

2. **Inadequate SMARTS Patterns:**
   - **Rule 1 (Amino Acids with Additional Carboxyl Groups):**
     - The current SMARTS pattern may not comprehensively capture amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups, potentially missing relevant modifiers.
   - **Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with EWGs at the Para Position):**
     - The patterns may not enforce positional specificity (para position), leading to incorrect matches with ortho or meta substituents.
     - Essential electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs), such as aldehydes (–CHO) and ketones, are not included in the current EWG patterns.

3. **Limited Functional Group Coverage:**
   - The lists of EWGs and electron-donating groups (EDGs) are currently limited, potentially excluding functional groups that significantly impact yield.

4. **Overly General or Specific Patterns:**
   - Without precise SMARTS patterns, the model might incorrectly classify modifiers, either overestimating or underestimating the yield based on incomplete or inaccurate matching.

5. **Insufficient Validation and Testing:**
   - The SMARTS patterns and rules have not been thoroughly validated against known examples, which may result in incorrect predictions due to mismatches.

6. **Performance Metrics Indicate Underfitting:**
   - The decrease in validation accuracy and inconsistencies in predictions suggest that the model is underfitting, failing to capture the complexity of relationships between molecular structures and yield.

**Directions to Optimize the Current Rules:**

1. **Implement All Specified Rules (Rules 3 to 15):**
   - **Action:** Extend the code to include the remaining rules by defining their SMARTS patterns and logic.
   - **Rationale:** Incorporating all the rules will allow the model to consider a broader range of chemical features that influence catalytic activity and yield, improving predictive performance.

2. **Refine and Enhance SMARTS Patterns:**

   - **Rule 1 Improvements:**
     - **Modify SMARTS Patterns:** Adjust the existing patterns to accurately capture amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups, regardless of their position.
     - **Use Recursive SMARTS:** Consider recursive patterns to match side chains with carboxyl groups in various positions on the amino acid backbone.
     - **Example:** Use patterns that search for amino acids where the side chain contains a –COOH group, not just the backbone.

   - **Rule 2 Improvements:**
     - **Enforce Positional Specificity:**
       - **Issue:** Current patterns do not specify the para position, leading to potential mismatches.
       - **Action:** Modify SMARTS patterns to ensure that EWGs are located at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.
       - **Example:** Use SMARTS like `c1cc([#6][EWG])ccc1C(=O)O` where `[#6][EWG]` represents the EWG attached to the aromatic ring at the para position.
     - **Expand EWG Patterns:**
       - **Issue:** Important EWGs like aldehydes, ketones, and cyano groups are missing.
       - **Action:** Include additional EWGs in the patterns, such as `-C=O`, `-CHO`, `-CN`.
       - **Example:** Update `ewg_patterns` to include these functional groups.

   - **General Enhancements:**
     - **Include Heteroaromatic Compounds:**
       - **Issue:** Current patterns may not match heteroaromatic rings.
       - **Action:** Adjust patterns to include heteroatoms in the ring, using `[$(a)][CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]`, where `a` represents any aromatic atom.
     - **Expand EWG and EDG Lists:**
       - **Action:** Add all relevant functional groups cited in the rules to the `ewg_patterns` and `edg_patterns`.
       - **Example:** Include groups like –NO₂, –COOH, –NH₂, –OH, –OCH₃.

3. **Validate SMARTS Patterns Against Known Compounds:**
   - **Action:** Test the SMARTS patterns on a set of molecules with known outcomes to ensure correct matching.
   - **Rationale:** Validation helps identify and correct any issues with the patterns, ensuring they perform as intended.

4. **Improve Error Handling and Molecule Parsing:**
   - **Issue:** Molecules that cannot be parsed result in zeros, which might skew the data.
   - **Action:** Implement robust SMILES parsing with proper error handling. Use `Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi, sanitize=False)` and handle sanitization separately.
   - **Rationale:** Ensures that parsing errors do not lead to incorrect data entries.

5. **Document the Code Thoroughly:**
   - **Action:** Add detailed comments and explanations for each SMARTS pattern and logic block.
   - **Rationale:** Improves code readability and maintainability, making it easier to update and refine in the future.

6. **Utilize Functional Group Libraries:**
   - **Action:** Use RDKit's built-in functional group definitions or external libraries to avoid errors in writing SMARTS patterns.
   - **Rationale:** Leverages existing, well-tested patterns to ensure accuracy.

7. **Analyze Individual Rule Contributions:**
   - **Action:** Assess metrics (support, confidence, lift) for each rule individually to determine their effectiveness.
   - **Rationale:** Identifies which rules contribute positively and which may need refinement or removal.

8. **Simplify Complex Rules:**
   - **Action:** Simplify overly complex or highly specific rules to make them more generalizable.
   - **Rationale:** Simplified rules are easier to interpret and may apply to a broader range of molecules, increasing support.

9. **Monitor Performance Metrics:**
   - **Action:** Regularly compare performance metrics across training and validation sets to detect overfitting or underfitting.
   - **Rationale:** Ensures that improvements in the model are genuine and not artifacts of overfitting.

10. **Incorporate Domain Expertise:**
    - **Action:** Collaborate with chemists or materials scientists to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules.
    - **Rationale:** Expert insights can help refine rules based on chemical principles, potentially uncovering factors that metrics alone might miss.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

Yes, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The decrease in validation accuracy and the underfitting observed in the model's performance indicate that the current rules do not fully capture the complexity of the data. By implementing the remaining rules, refining existing rules, and ensuring accurate SMARTS patterns, the model can:

- **Improve Generalization:** A more comprehensive rule set will better represent the diversity of chemical structures and their impact on yield.

- **Enhance Predictive Accuracy:** Refinement of rules and patterns will result in more accurate predictions, as the model will more closely align with the underlying chemical principles.

- **Avoid Overfitting:** By focusing on improving model generalizability and validating against unseen data, the risk of overfitting will be minimized.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups**, such as **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid), result in **high yield**. The extra carboxylate group may enhance coordination with the metal center, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** lead to **high yield**. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. Conversely, **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position** result in **low yield**—examples are **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. EWGs increase the acidity and coordinate better with the metal center.

- **Rule 3**: **Omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. In contrast, **omega-amino acids with longer chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield**, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Shorter chains may facilitate better interaction due to reduced steric hindrance.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain**, especially **sugar acids**, lead to **high yield**. Examples include **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**. Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples are **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. The proximity of heteroatoms (like nitrogen) aids in coordinating with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. In contrast, **modifiers with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings** result in **low yield**, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. Aliphatic thiols have greater flexibility for coordination.

- **Rule 7**: **Unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic chain may enhance interaction with the catalyst's active site.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with amide bonds**, particularly those linking amino acids or functional groups, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples are **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. The amide linkage may hinder coordination due to reduced electron density on the nitrogen.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect diminishes coordination ability.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially polyether chains, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may compete with carboxylate for metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where functional groups are connected to an aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain** lead to **high yield**. Examples include **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**. The aliphatic linker reduces steric hindrance, allowing better interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl or amino groups on long aliphatic chains (more than six carbons)** result in **low yield**. Examples are **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. The polar groups on long chains may interfere with catalyst binding.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating heteroatoms** result in **low yield**. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine). The absence of coordinating groups reduces interaction with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan). The indole nitrogen can coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers where two aromatic rings are directly connected without flexible linkers** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. Lack of flexibility may hinder optimal coordination geometry.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing carboxyl groups** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The additional carboxylate groups enhance coordination with the metal center, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** tend to result in **high yield**. Examples are **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. However, **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position that include additional coordinating groups** like amino groups can also lead to **high yield**—for instance, **4-aminobenzoic acid**. The presence of coordinating groups enhances interaction with the metal center, overriding the effect of EDGs.

- **Rule 3**: **Omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**, such as **5-aminopentanoic acid**. In contrast, **omega-amino acids with longer chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield**—examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Shorter chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups**, particularly **sugar acids and polyols**, lead to **high yield**. Examples include **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**. Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 5**: **Heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms adjacent or near to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples are **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. The proximity of heteroatoms (such as nitrogen or oxygen) enhances metal coordination.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer)** result in **high yield**—for example, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. Conversely, **thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings** result in **low yield**, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. Aliphatic thiols offer flexibility for better coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: **Unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons without additional polar functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance interaction with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, promoting reactivity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds**, especially those linking amino acids or functional groups, tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective coordination.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms diminishes the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially **polyether chains**, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, disrupting optimal binding.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain longer than three carbons** lead to **high yield**. Examples include **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**. The longer aliphatic linker reduces steric hindrance and allows better alignment for coordination.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms**, such as indole nitrogen in **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), result in **high yield**. In contrast, amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating heteroatoms, like **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), result in **low yield**. The presence of coordinating heteroatoms enhances metal binding.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with two aromatic rings directly connected without flexible linkers (biaryl compounds)** result in **low yield**, such as **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. Lack of flexibility may hinder optimal coordination geometry. Conversely, **modifiers with aromatic rings connected via flexible aliphatic chains** result in **high yield**—for example, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with polar functional groups (hydroxyl or amino) on long aliphatic chains (more than six carbons)** result in **low yield**. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. The increased chain length may cause unfavorable interactions or solubility issues, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group (α-keto acids)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The additional carbonyl may interfere with metal coordination due to competition or electronic effects.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: The rules are generally clear and specific, allowing for straightforward determination of whether a modifier will result in high or low yield based on its structural features. This clarity facilitates their practical application.

- **Comment 2**: The rules provide solid physical-chemical insights, effectively correlating structural characteristics of the modifiers with their impact on catalytic activity. This deepens the understanding of how specific functional groups and molecular architectures influence the reaction outcome.

- **Comment 3**: Many rules consider combinations of sub-structures and functional groups, increasing their complexity and usefulness. For example, **Rule 2** examines both the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups and additional coordinating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids, enhancing its predictive power.

- **Comment 4**: Most rules have sufficient coverage, supported by at least two data points. For instance, **Rule 1** is backed by data on aspartic and glutamic acids, and **Rule 14** is supported by multiple examples of modifiers with long aliphatic chains bearing polar groups. However, some rules like **Rule 7** (octanoic acid) and **Rule 15** (4-oxoheptanedioic acid) are supported by only one data point each, which may limit their reliability.

- **Comment 5**: The rules strike a good balance between complexity and coverage. They are detailed enough to provide valuable insights while general enough to encompass a broad range of modifiers. Expanding the dataset to include more examples supporting underrepresented rules would further enhance their robustness and applicability.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: Rephrase the existing rules using explicit structural features and standard chemical descriptors that can be directly parsed from SMILES strings. For instance, specify the exact positions of functional groups, chain lengths, and presence of specific atoms or rings.

- **Advice 2**: Employ SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to define structural features within the rules. SMARTS allows for precise matching of substructures in SMILES, facilitating automatic identification and numerical encoding of features.

- **Advice 3**: Simplify overlapping or redundant rules by consolidating them based on common structural features. This reduces complexity and aids in creating a clear decision tree that can be more easily translated into numerical data.

- **Advice 4**: Quantify properties where possible. Instead of using qualitative terms like "short" or "long" chains, specify the exact number of carbon atoms (e.g., aliphatic chains with **n** carbons where **n ≤ 5**). This precision allows for direct numerical representation.

- **Advice 5**: Replace subjective terms like "electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)" and "electron-donating groups (EDGs)" with specific functional groups or substituents that can be identified in the chemical structure (e.g., nitro groups, amino groups). Alternatively, assign numerical values to substituents based on Hammett sigma constants or other electronic parameters.

- **Advice 6**: Define the positions of substituents relative to reference points, such as the carboxylic acid group. For example, specify "para-substituted benzoic acids with a nitro group at the para position relative to the carboxyl group."

- **Advice 7**: Introduce binary features indicating the presence or absence of specific functional groups or atoms (e.g., presence of thiol group: yes/no). This approach simplifies the feature matrix and aids in statistical analysis.

- **Advice 8**: Utilize standard molecular descriptors that can be calculated from SMILES strings, such as molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and rotatable bonds. Including these descriptors can help in quantifying steric and electronic effects.

- **Advice 9**: For rules involving ring systems, specify the type of ring (e.g., aromatic, heteroaromatic) and any substitutions on the ring. Use descriptors such as "pyridine ring with nitrogen at position 1" to allow accurate parsing.

- **Advice 10**: Create a hierarchical rule system where general rules are defined first, followed by exceptions or specific cases. This structure aids in programming logic for feature extraction and reduces ambiguity.

- **Advice 11**: Avoid using terms related to three-dimensional arrangements or steric hindrance unless they can be approximated by calculable descriptors from SMILES (e.g., use of molecular volume or steric descriptors derived from topology).

- **Advice 12**: Where electronic effects are critical, consider calculating and using computational descriptors such as partial atomic charges or electrostatic potentials, if such data can be obtained reliably from SMILES.

- **Advice 13**: Incorporate chain length as a numeric feature rather than a qualitative one. For example, create a feature for "aliphatic chain length" and assign the exact number of carbons in the chain.

- **Advice 14**: For modifiers with multiple functional groups, enumerate all functional groups present and their counts to capture the cumulative effects on yield.

- **Advice 15**: Ensure that all new rules and features are mutually exclusive or clearly defined to prevent overlap and conflicting categorizations, which aids in cleaner data for modeling.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The short chain length allows effective coordination of both amino and carboxyl groups with minimal steric hindrance, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups within a sugar-like or polyol structure, alongside a carboxylic acid group**, result in **high yield**. Examples are **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**. Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms (nitrogen or oxygen) adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. The proximity of heteroatoms provides additional coordination sites, strengthening interaction with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer) in addition to a carboxyl group** result in **high yield**—for example, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons without additional polar functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, promoting reactivity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains longer than five carbons** result in **low yield**. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Longer chains increase flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position without additional coordinating groups** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains attached to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid, especially polyether chains**, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, disrupting optimal binding.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds linking amino acids or functional groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups directly attached to an aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. The rigidity of the aromatic ring may hinder effective coordination of the thiol group with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid (α-keto acids or dicarboxylic acids with additional carbonyls)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The additional carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing non-coordinating sulfur groups (thioethers)** result in **low yield**. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid** (methionine derivative). Thioether sulfur is less effective in metal coordination compared to thiol sulfur.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in its description, specifying amino acids with side chains containing an additional carboxylic acid group lead to high yield. The rule provides adequate physicochemical insight by explaining that the two carboxyl groups enhance metal coordination, improving catalytic activity. It considers a combination of substructures (amino acids with specific side chains), satisfying the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by multiple data points, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly defines modifiers as para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups (e.g., nitro or amino) resulting in high yield. It offers sufficient physicochemical insight by explaining that these substituents increase acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, enhancing interaction with the metal center. The rule considers combinations of substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points, including 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-aminobenzoic acid, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear, specifying that omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer result in high yield. It provides adequate physicochemical insight by attributing the effect to minimal steric hindrance and effective coordination of both amino and carboxyl groups. The rule considers chain length and functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. However, coverage is limited, with only one supporting data point (5-aminopentanoic acid), which may not be sufficient for strong validation.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 explicitly describes modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups within a sugar-like or polyol structure, alongside a carboxylic acid group, result in high yield. The rule provides adequate physicochemical insight by explaining that multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst's active sites. It combines multiple functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by multiple data points, such as gluconic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid, fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly specifies that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms (nitrogen or oxygen) adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield. It provides adequate physicochemical insight by highlighting that the proximity of heteroatoms offers additional coordination sites, strengthening interaction with the metal center. The rule considers specific structural features, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points, including pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in describing modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer) in addition to a carboxylic acid group result in high yield. It provides physicochemical insight by explaining that the thiol group offers additional coordination capability. The rule combines functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), which may not be sufficient for robust validation.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly defines that aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons without additional polar functional groups result in high yield. It provides some physicochemical insight by suggesting that hydrophobic chains enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst. The rule is relatively simple, focusing on chain length, which balances complexity and coverage. However, coverage is limited to one data point (octanoic acid), potentially weakening its validation.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, stating that omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains longer than five carbons result in low yield. It offers adequate physicochemical insight by indicating that longer chains increase flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination with the metal center. The rule combines chain length and functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points, such as 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid, meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position without additional coordinating groups result in low yield. It provides adequate physicochemical insight by explaining that EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination. The rule considers both structural and electronic features, meeting the complexity criterion. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (4-methylbenzoic acid), which may not be sufficient for strong validation.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly describes modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains attached to the carboxylic acid group result in low yield. It provides physicochemical insight by noting that the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability. The rule is specific but balances complexity and clarity. Coverage is limited to one data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), which may weaken its robustness.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly states that modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid, especially polyether chains, result in low yield. It offers adequate physicochemical insight by suggesting that ether oxygens may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, disrupting optimal binding. The rule combines structural features, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points, such as 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly defines that modifiers containing amide bonds linking amino acids or functional groups result in low yield. It provides adequate physicochemical insight by explaining that amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective coordination with the metal center. The rule considers combinations of substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points, including (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid and 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly specifies that modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in low yield. It provides physicochemical insight by noting that the rigidity of the aromatic ring may hinder effective coordination of the thiol group with the metal center. The rule considers specific functional group positioning, satisfying the complexity criterion. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), which may not be sufficient for strong validation.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly states that modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid (α-keto acids or dicarboxylic acids with additional carbonyls) result in low yield. It provides adequate physicochemical insight by indicating that additional carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably. The rule combines multiple functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage is limited to one data point (4-oxoheptanedioic acid), which may weaken its robustness.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 clearly defines that amino acids with side chains containing non-coordinating sulfur groups (thioethers) result in low yield. It provides physicochemical insight by explaining that thioether sulfur is less effective in metal coordination compared to thiol sulfur. The rule considers specific functional groups within amino acids, satisfying the complexity criterion. However, coverage is limited to a single data point ((2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid), which may not be sufficient for strong validation.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing an additional carboxylic acid group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups enhances metal coordination, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids where the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) or a coordinating group (such as nitro or amino)** result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-aminobenzoic acid**. The substituents increase the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, enhancing interaction with the metal center.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The short chain length allows effective coordination of both amino and carboxyl groups with minimal steric hindrance, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups within a sugar-like or polyol structure, alongside a carboxylic acid group**, result in **high yield**. Examples are **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**. Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms (nitrogen or oxygen) adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. The proximity of heteroatoms provides additional coordination sites, strengthening interaction with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer) in addition to a carboxyl group** result in **high yield**—for example, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons without additional polar functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, promoting reactivity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains longer than five carbons** result in **low yield**. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Longer chains increase flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position without additional coordinating groups** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains attached to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid, especially polyether chains**, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, disrupting optimal binding.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds linking amino acids or functional groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups directly attached to an aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. The rigidity of the aromatic ring may hinder effective coordination of the thiol group with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid (α-keto acids or dicarboxylic acids with additional carbonyls)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The additional carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing non-coordinating sulfur groups (thioethers)** result in **low yield**. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid** (methionine derivative). Thioether sulfur is less effective in metal coordination compared to thiol sulfur.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: Modify the `count_threshold` dictionary to use the SMARTS strings returned by `pat.GetSmarts()` instead of the variable names. Currently, the keys in `count_threshold` are the variable names (e.g., `hydroxyl_group`), but `pat.GetSmarts()` returns the SMARTS string (e.g., `'[OX2H]'`). This mismatch causes the count threshold checks to fail. Update the `count_threshold` entries as follows:
  
  ```python
  'count_threshold': {'[OX2H]': 3}  # For Rule 4
  'count_threshold': {'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]': 2}  # For Rule 1
  ```
  
  And when checking for the count threshold, compare using the SMARTS string:
  
  ```python
  if 'count_threshold' in rule and pat.GetSmarts() in rule['count_threshold']:
      threshold = rule['count_threshold'][pat.GetSmarts()]
      if len(matches) >= threshold:
          group_match = True
          break
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: Correct the SMARTS pattern for `aromatic_amino` in Rule 2. The current pattern `'[a][NX3H2]'` may not match all aromatic amino groups, especially if they are deprotonated or have different protonation states. Update the pattern to include all possible amino groups attached to an aromatic ring:

  ```python
  aromatic_amino = '[a][NX3;H2,H1,H0]'  # Matches primary, secondary, and tertiary amino groups on aromatic rings
  ```
  
  Additionally, ensure that the amino group is in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. You can use more specific SMARTS patterns to enforce the para substitution:

  ```python
  # Para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acid with amino group
  para_amino_benzoic_acid = 'c1ccc(cc1[NH2])C(=O)O'
  ```

- **Suggestion 3**: Enhance the SMARTS pattern for Rule 4 to accurately detect sugar-like or polyol structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. The current pattern may not effectively identify such structures. Consider using a pattern that matches saccharide structures:

  ```python
  # Pattern for sugar-like structures
  sugar_pattern = '[CX4H1][OX2H][CX4H1][OX2H][CX4H1][OX2H][CX4H1][OX2H][CX4H1][OX2H][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```
  
  Alternatively, count all hydroxyl groups in the molecule:

  ```python
  # Count all hydroxyl groups
  hydroxyl_matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts('[OX2H]'))
  if len(hydroxyl_matches) >= 3:
      # Proceed with matching Rule 4
  ```

- **Suggestion 4**: Refine the pattern for heteroaromatic carboxylic acids in Rule 5 to ensure the heteroatom is adjacent to the carboxyl group. The current pattern may not enforce adjacency. Update the pattern as follows:

  ```python
  # Heteroaromatic carboxylic acid with heteroatom adjacent to the carboxyl group
  heteroaromatic_carboxylic_acid = '[n,o][c][c][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```
  
  You may need to adjust the pattern based on the specific heteroaromatic rings in your dataset.

- **Suggestion 5**: For Rule 7, ensure that the exclusion of polar functional groups is correctly implemented. The current `exclude_patterns` may not cover all polar groups. Update the `exclude_patterns` to include ether linkages and other polar groups:

  ```python
  'exclude_patterns': [
      ['[OX2]', '[NX3]', '[SX2H]', '[NX3][CX3](=O)[#6]', '[F,Cl,Br,I]', '[CX3](=O)[OX2][#6]']  # Exclude hydroxyl, amine, thiol, amide, halogens, esters
  ]
  ```

- **Suggestion 6**: For Rule 11, expand the SMARTS pattern to detect polyether chains extending from the carboxylic acid. The current pattern may only match simple ether linkages. Consider using a recursive pattern to match polyethers:

  ```python
  # Pattern for carboxylic acid connected to a polyether chain
  polyether_chain = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]-[OX2]-[CX4]-[OX2]-[CX4]'
  ```
  
  Adjust the pattern to match longer polyether chains as needed.

- **Suggestion 7**: Verify that all SMARTS patterns are correctly defined and match the intended functional groups and structural features. Use cheminformatics tools like RDKit to test each pattern individually with known compounds to ensure accurate matching.

- **Suggestion 8**: Incorporate explicit matching for substitution patterns where required. For example, in Rule 2, enforce that the EWG is in the para position relative to the carboxyl group by specifying the relative positions in the SMARTS pattern.

- **Suggestion 9**: Add logging or print statements in the code to output which patterns are matching for each molecule. This will help you debug and understand why certain rules are not matching as expected.

- **Suggestion 10**: Ensure that stereochemistry is considered if relevant. Some SMARTS patterns may require explicit specification of stereochemistry to match certain molecules.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

After reviewing the provided metrics and the evolution of the rule performance over the iterations, here is a detailed analysis focusing on **confidence** and **lift** as requested.

### **Comparison with Reference Metrics**

**Reference Metrics (Mean of Previous Rule Matrices):**
- **Train Support:** [0.1667, 0.1845]
- **Train Confidence:** [0.6352, 0.5396]
- **Train Lift:** [1.2048, 1.0559]
- **Train Leverage:** [0.0289, -0.0041]

**Current Metrics:**
- **Train Support:** 0.0248
- **Train Confidence:** 0.7167
- **Train Lift:** 1.4388
- **Train Leverage:** 0.0115

### **Observations**

1. **Confidence:**
   - The **current train confidence** is **71.67%**, which is a significant improvement over the **reference confidence values** of **63.52%** and **53.96%**.
   - Over the iterations, confidence has generally increased:
     - Iteration 1: **61.67%**
     - Iteration 3: **65.59%**
     - Iteration 5: **83.33%**
     - Current: **71.67%**

2. **Lift:**
   - The **current train lift** is **1.4388**, higher than the **reference lifts** of **1.2048** and **1.0559**.
   - The lift has shown an increasing trend:
     - Iteration 1: **1.2463**
     - Iteration 3: **1.3146**
     - Iteration 5: **1.6204**
     - Current: **1.4388**

3. **Support:**
   - The **current train support** is **2.48%**, which is significantly lower than the **reference support values** of **16.67%** and **18.45%**.
   - Throughout iterations, support has fluctuated:
     - Iteration 1: **1.90%**
     - Iteration 3: **5.54%**
     - Iteration 5: **11.43%**
     - Current: **2.48%**

4. **Leverage:**
   - The **current train leverage** is **0.0115**, which is lower than the first reference value but better than the second (negative) reference value.
   - Leverage values over iterations:
     - Iteration 1: **0.0050**
     - Iteration 3: **0.0160**
     - Iteration 5: **0.0335**
     - Current: **0.0115**

### **Interpretation**

- **Improved Confidence and Lift:**
  - The increase in **confidence** suggests that the rules are becoming more reliable in predicting **high yield** outcomes when the conditions are met.
  - The higher **lift** indicates that the rules are more effective compared to random chance, showing a stronger association between the rule conditions and the high yield outcome.

- **Decreased Support:**
  - The reduction in **support** means that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.
  - A low support value can affect the generalizability of the rules, as they might capture niche scenarios rather than broader trends.

- **Leverage Insights:**
  - Positive **leverage** values indicate that the rules have a stronger association than what would be expected by chance.
  - The current leverage, while positive, is lower than some previous iterations, suggesting that the overall added value of the rules has decreased in terms of coverage.

### **Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum Assessment:**
  - The improvements in **confidence** and **lift** have shown signs of plateauing after Iteration 5.
  - The **confidence** peaked at **83.33%** during Iteration 5 but decreased slightly to **71.67%** in the current metrics.
  - The **lift** also peaked at **1.6204** in Iteration 5 and decreased to **1.4388** currently.

- **Iteration Sufficiency:**
  - Given the diminishing returns in improving confidence and lift, it's possible that a local optimum has been reached.
  - Further iterations may lead to overfitting, especially given the decreasing support, which suggests that the rules are becoming too specialized.

### **Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Balance Confidence and Support:**
   - Aim to increase **support** without significantly compromising **confidence**.
   - Rules with very high confidence but low support may not be practically useful, as they apply to very few cases.

2. **Simplify and Generalize Rules:**
   - Review the current **15 rules** to identify opportunities for consolidation.
   - Generalizing rules can increase support by encompassing a broader range of cases.

3. **Focus on High-Impact Features:**
   - Identify which modifiers or structural features contribute most significantly to high yields.
   - Prioritize rules that incorporate these features to cover more data points.

4. **Avoid Overfitting:**
   - Be cautious of creating rules that are too specific to the training data.
   - Validate rules using a separate test set to ensure they generalize well.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - If possible, augment the dataset to include more examples, which can help in developing rules with higher support.

6. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Revisit earlier iterations to assess whether certain rules with higher support but slightly lower confidence might be more practical.
   - Consider hybrid rules that strike a balance between support and confidence.

### **Specific Suggestions for Current Rules**

- **Combine Similar Rules:**
  - Rules 1, 3, and 5 involve amino acids and heteroatoms coordinating with the metal center. These could potentially be combined into a more general rule about modifiers containing coordinating functional groups.

- **Re-evaluate Low-Support High-Confidence Rules:**
  - For rules with very low support (e.g., Rules 6 and 13), consider whether they can be broadened or if they are capturing rare exceptions.

- **Address Contradictions:**
  - Ensure that rules do not contradict each other, which can confuse the model and reduce overall performance.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Introduce new descriptors or features that might help in capturing more general patterns, such as electronic properties (e.g., pKa, logP) or steric factors.

### **Conclusion**

While the current rules demonstrate high confidence and lift, indicating strong predictive ability for certain cases, the low support suggests limited applicability across the entire dataset. By focusing on increasing support through rule generalization and ensuring that the rules are not overfitting to specific instances, the overall performance and utility of the model can be enhanced. It may be beneficial to conclude the current iteration cycle and focus on refining the existing rules based on the above recommendations.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation Set and Train Set**

Upon reviewing the provided accuracies from previous iterations and the current iteration, several observations can be made:

- **Previous Iterations**:

    - **Validation Accuracies** were consistently high, with values such as 0.76 across multiple folds.
    - **Test Accuracies** were 0.75 in some iterations but dropped to 0.625 in others.

- **Current Iteration**:

    - **Validation Accuracy** has decreased to **0.6857** in the latest model.
    - This represents a decline compared to the previous validation accuracies of around 0.76.

**Interpretation**:

- The **decrease in validation accuracy** suggests that the current set of rules may not be as effective as in previous iterations.
- This could indicate that the model is **underfitting**, failing to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
- Alternatively, the high accuracies in previous iterations might have been due to **overfitting**, where the model performed well on the training and validation sets but failed to generalize to the test set.

**Analysis Based on the SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insight into how each feature (rule) influences the model's predictions. Analyzing these values helps identify which rules contribute to incorrect predictions.

**1. Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low)**

Several molecules were predicted to have high loading, but experimentally, they have low loading:

- **Molecules**:

    - *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
    - *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*
    - *CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O*
    - *C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O*
    - *C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O* (inferred from context)

- **Contributing Rules**:

    - **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing amide bonds linking amino acids or functional groups result in low yield.*
        - **SHAP Values**: High positive values (~0.0679 to 0.0905) contributing to predicting high loading.
    - **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains longer than five carbons result in low yield.*
        - **SHAP Values**: Positive values (~0.0229 to 0.0456) contributing to predicting high loading.
    - **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in low yield.*
        - **SHAP Values**: Positive values (~0.0229 to 0.0234) contributing to predicting high loading.

**Interpretation**:

- **Conflict Between Rules and SHAP Values**:

    - **Rule 12** and **Rule 8** are intended to contribute to predicting low yield.
    - However, the SHAP analysis shows that these rules are contributing positively to predictions of high loading.
    - This discrepancy indicates that these rules may not be correctly capturing the relationship between molecular features and experimental outcomes.

**2. Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High)**

From the provided data, there are limited instances where the model predicts low loading but the experimental value is high. However, attention should be paid to any such cases to identify rules contributing negatively when they should not.

**Thoughts on How to Improve Current Rules**

Based on the SHAP analysis and the performance metrics, the following recommendations can be made to improve the current set of rules:

**1. Reevaluate and Refine Rule 12**

- **Issue Identified**:

    - **Rule 12** is intended to predict low yield for modifiers containing amide bonds.
    - The SHAP values indicate that Rule 12 is contributing to high yield predictions, contrary to its intended effect.

- **Recommendation**:

    - **Reassess the Basis of Rule 12**:
        - Review the empirical data to confirm whether modifiers with amide bonds consistently result in low yield.
        - If exceptions are found, consider modifying the rule to account for additional factors, such as the position of the amide bond or the presence of other coordinating groups.
    - **Adjust the Rule**:
        - Modify Rule 12 to more accurately reflect the observed trends.
        - For example, specify that only certain types of amide-containing modifiers lead to low yield, or incorporate additional structural criteria.

**2. Refine Rule 8**

- **Issue Identified**:

    - **Rule 8** predicts low yield for omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains longer than five carbons.
    - SHAP values show that Rule 8 is contributing positively to high yield predictions in cases where the experimental yield is low.

- **Recommendation**:

    - **Reconsider Chain Length Threshold**:
        - Investigate whether the chain length threshold of five carbons is appropriate.
        - Analyze data to determine if modifiers with slightly longer chains (e.g., up to seven carbons) still result in high yield.
    - **Include Additional Structural Factors**:
        - Consider other features that may influence yield, such as branching, presence of additional functional groups, or overall molecule flexibility.
    - **Revise Rule 8**:
        - Update the rule to reflect a more accurate relationship between chain length and yield, possibly adjusting the chain length parameter or specifying exceptions.

**3. Modify or Clarify Rule 13**

- **Issue Identified**:

    - **Rule 13** targets modifiers with thiol groups attached to an aromatic ring, predicting low yield.
    - SHAP analysis indicates that Rule 13 contributes to predicting high yield in some cases where the experimental yield is low.

- **Recommendation**:

    - **Examine the Role of Thiol Groups**:
        - Evaluate whether the position of the thiol group (e.g., ortho, meta, para) affects yield.
        - Consider whether other substituents on the aromatic ring influence the thiol's coordinating ability.
    - **Revise Rule 13**:
        - Modify the rule to include these nuances, potentially narrowing its scope to specific cases where the thiol group leads to low yield.
        - Alternatively, if thiol groups attached to aromatic rings do not consistently result in low yield, consider removing or replacing the rule.

**4. Address Overlapping or Conflicting Rules**

- **Issue Identified**:

    - Some modifiers may satisfy multiple rules that predict both high and low yield, causing confusion in the model.

- **Recommendation**:

    - **Identify Overlaps**:
        - Analyze the rules to find and resolve any overlaps or conflicts.
        - Ensure that each rule is distinct and applies to a unique set of molecular features.
    - **Implement Rule Hierarchies**:
        - Establish a priority system where certain rules take precedence over others when conflicts arise.
    - **Refine Rules for Clarity**:
        - Rewrite rules to be mutually exclusive where possible, reducing ambiguity.

**5. Enhance Generalization to Prevent Overfitting or Underfitting**

- **Issue Identified**:

    - The decreased validation accuracy may indicate overfitting in previous iterations or underfitting in the current model.

- **Recommendation**:

    - **Simplify Rules**:
        - Remove or consolidate rules that have minimal impact or contribute to confusion.
        - Focus on the most significant features that consistently predict yield accurately.
    - **Balance Model Complexity**:
        - Ensure that the model is neither too simplistic (underfitting) nor too complex (overfitting).
        - Use cross-validation results to guide adjustments to the model's complexity.

**6. Incorporate Additional Relevant Features**

- **Issue Identified**:

    - The current rules may not capture all molecular features that influence yield.

- **Recommendation**:

    - **Use SHAP Analysis for Feature Discovery**:
        - Identify features with significant SHAP values not currently represented in the rules.
    - **Develop New Rules**:
        - Create additional rules based on these features, ensuring they are supported by empirical data.
    - **Iterate and Validate**:
        - Test new rules in the model, evaluate their impact on accuracy, and refine as necessary.

**7. Review Dataset for Balance and Representativeness**

- **Issue Identified**:

    - An imbalanced dataset can skew model performance and affect the accuracy metrics.

- **Recommendation**:

    - **Assess Class Distribution**:
        - Ensure that the dataset has a balanced number of high yield and low yield examples.
    - **Augment Data if Necessary**:
        - If the dataset is imbalanced, consider collecting more data or using techniques such as synthetic data generation.
    - **Validate Model Across Diverse Examples**:
        - Make sure the model performs well across different types of modifiers.

**8. Fine-Tune Cross-Validation Strategy**

- **Issue Identified**:

    - Variation in performance across cross-validation folds may indicate issues with generalization.

- **Recommendation**:

    - **Analyze Fold Performance**:
        - Examine individual fold results to identify any patterns or consistent discrepancies.
    - **Adjust Fold Assignments**:
        - Ensure that each fold is representative of the overall dataset.
    - **Consider Stratified Sampling**:
        - Use stratified cross-validation to maintain consistent class proportions across folds.

**Summary**

The current set of rules appears to be less effective than in previous iterations, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy and the discrepancies revealed by the SHAP analysis. To improve the model:

- **Reevaluate and refine rules that are contributing incorrectly to predictions, particularly Rules 12, 8, and 13.**
- **Ensure that rules accurately reflect the observed relationships between molecular features and experimental outcomes.**
- **Simplify the model to enhance generalization and prevent overfitting or underfitting.**
- **Use insights from SHAP analysis to discover additional relevant features and develop new or improved rules.**

By implementing these recommendations, the model's predictive performance should improve, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions of modifier loading on catalysts in future iterations.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

The discussions above focused on evaluating the performance of the current set of rules used to predict the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. Key metrics such as train support, confidence, lift, and leverage were analyzed across different iterations to assess the effectiveness of the rules. Additionally, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis was utilized to understand the influence of each rule on the model's predictions.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Improved Confidence and Lift but Decreased Support:**
   - The current rules exhibit higher confidence (71.67%) and lift (1.4388) compared to previous iterations.
   - However, train support has decreased significantly to 2.48%, indicating that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.

2. **Potential Overfitting Concerns:**
   - The model's validation accuracy has decreased from previous values (around 0.76) to 0.6857, suggesting possible underfitting.
   - SHAP analysis revealed inconsistencies where some rules intended to predict low yield were contributing to predictions of high yield.

3. **Conflicting Contributions from Certain Rules:**
   - **Rule 12** (Modifiers containing amide bonds) and **Rule 8** (Omega-amino acids with long aliphatic chains) were contributing positively to high yield predictions when they should predict low yield.
   - **Rule 13** (Modifiers with thiol groups attached to aromatic rings) also showed discrepancies in SHAP contributions.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Modify SMARTS Patterns for Accurate Matching:**
   - **Adjust `count_threshold` Dictionary:**
     - Use SMARTS strings (`pat.GetSmarts()`) as keys instead of variable names to correctly apply count thresholds.
   - **Correct SMARTS Pattern for Aromatic Amino Groups in Rule 2:**
     - Update the pattern to `[a][NX3;H2,H1,H0]` to match all protonation states.
     - Enforce para substitution by specifying relative positions in the SMARTS pattern.

2. **Enhance Patterns for Sugar-Like Structures in Rule 4:**
   - Use patterns that accurately detect multiple hydroxyl groups, such as counting occurrences of `[OX2H]`.
   - Consider patterns that specifically match saccharide structures.

3. **Refine Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acid Pattern in Rule 5:**
   - Ensure the heteroatom is adjacent to the carboxyl group by updating the pattern to reflect adjacency.

4. **Expand Exclusion Patterns in Rule 7:**
   - Incorporate additional polar functional groups in `exclude_patterns`, such as ethers and esters, to correctly exclude modifiers with these groups.

5. **Improve Detection of Polyether Chains in Rule 11:**
   - Use recursive SMARTS patterns to match polyethers extending from the carboxylic acid group.

6. **Reevaluate and Refine Specific Rules:**
   - **Rule 8:** Reconsider the chain length threshold and include additional structural factors like branching or flexibility.
   - **Rule 12:** Reassess the impact of amide bonds on yield and adjust the rule to account for exceptions or specify conditions.
   - **Rule 13:** Examine the influence of thiol groups on aromatic rings and modify the rule to reflect accurate associations with yield.

7. **Address Overlapping or Conflicting Rules:**
   - Identify and resolve overlaps between rules to prevent conflicting predictions.
   - Establish a hierarchy or priority system where necessary.

8. **Simplify and Generalize Rules:**
   - Combine similar rules to increase support while maintaining high confidence.
   - Focus on high-impact features that have a significant influence on the yield.

9. **Enhance Model Generalization:**
   - Avoid overfitting by ensuring that rules are not too specific to the training data.
   - Validate rules with separate test sets to confirm generalizability.

10. **Incorporate Additional Features and Data:**
    - Utilize SHAP analysis to identify important features not currently captured by the rules.
    - Consider collecting more data to improve model robustness and support.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The discrepancies observed in the SHAP analysis, where certain rules are contributing incorrectly to the predictions, indicate that the rules can be refined to improve accuracy. By adjusting the SMARTS patterns, reevaluating thresholds, and resolving conflicting rules, the model can achieve better generalization and predictive performance.

Implementing the suggested improvements will likely increase train support and validation accuracy while maintaining or enhancing confidence and lift. This balance is essential to develop a robust model that performs well across diverse examples.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing an additional carboxylic acid group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups enhances metal coordination, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids where the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) or a coordinating group (such as nitro or amino)** result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-aminobenzoic acid**. The substituents increase the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, enhancing interaction with the metal center.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The short chain length allows effective coordination of both amino and carboxyl groups with minimal steric hindrance, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups within a sugar-like or polyol structure, alongside a carboxylic acid group**, result in **high yield**. Examples are **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**. Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms (nitrogen or oxygen) adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. The proximity of heteroatoms provides additional coordination sites, strengthening interaction with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer) in addition to a carboxyl group** result in **high yield**—for example, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons without additional polar functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, promoting reactivity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains longer than five carbons** result in **low yield**. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Longer chains increase flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position without additional coordinating groups** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains attached to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid, especially polyether chains**, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, disrupting optimal binding.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds linking amino acids or functional groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups directly attached to an aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. The rigidity of the aromatic ring may hinder effective coordination of the thiol group with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid (α-keto acids or dicarboxylic acids with additional carbonyls)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The additional carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing non-coordinating sulfur groups (thioethers)** result in **low yield**. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid** (methionine derivative). Thioether sulfur is less effective in metal coordination compared to thiol sulfur.

** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Modify SMARTS Patterns for Accurate Matching**  
  Adjust the SMARTS patterns in your rules to ensure precise matching of molecular features. For example, in **Rule 2**, update the pattern for para-substituted aromatic amino groups to `[c][c]([c])[c][c][c][NX3;H2,H1,H0]` or use a position-specific pattern like `c1cc([NX3;H2,H1,H0])ccc1` to match all protonation states and enforce para substitution accurately.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust `count_threshold` Dictionary Keys**  
  Update the `count_threshold` dictionary to use SMARTS strings (`pat.GetSmarts()`) as keys instead of variable names. This change ensures that count thresholds are correctly applied to the corresponding SMARTS patterns across all rules.

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance Sugar-like Structure Detection in Rule 4**  
  Improve **Rule 4** by using SMARTS patterns that accurately detect multiple hydroxyl groups. Incorporate patterns that count the number of hydroxyls, such as `[$([OX2H])][$([CX4H])]`, to capture multiple alcohol functionalities. Consider using a pattern like `CO[C@@H]1[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@@H]1O` to match saccharide-like structures.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acid Pattern in Rule 5**  
  In **Rule 5**, ensure the heteroatom is adjacent to the carboxyl group by updating the SMARTS pattern to reflect adjacency. Use a pattern like `[n,o][c]c(=O)O` to match heteroatoms directly connected to the aromatic ring that bears the carboxylic acid group.

- **Advice 5**: **Expand Exclusion Patterns in Rule 7**  
  For **Rule 7**, include additional polar functional groups in the `exclude_patterns` to improve specificity. Incorporate SMARTS patterns for ethers (`[CX4][OX2][CX4]`), esters (`C(=O)[OX2H0][CX4]`), and other polar groups to correctly exclude modifiers containing these functionalities.

- **Advice 6**: **Improve Detection of Polyether Chains in Rule 11**  
  Enhance **Rule 11** by using recursive SMARTS patterns to detect polyether chains extending from the carboxylic acid group. Utilize a pattern like `O(C[O])C(=O)O` with recursive definitions to match multiple ether linkages accurately.

- **Advice 7**: **Reevaluate Chain Length Threshold in Rule 8**  
  For **Rule 8**, reconsider the chain length threshold for omega-amino acids. Include additional structural factors such as branching, rigidity, or flexibility that may influence the yield. Adjust the rule to account for these factors, potentially setting the chain length limit to six carbons instead of five.

- **Advice 8**: **Refine Rule 12 Regarding Amide Bonds**  
  Reassess **Rule 12** by specifying conditions under which amide bonds impact yield. Modify the rule to focus on modifiers where the amide bond reduces electron density on coordinating atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group. Clearly define exceptions and consider the position of the amide bond relative to the metal-coordinating groups.

- **Advice 9**: **Modify Rule 13 for Aromatic Thiol Groups**  
  Examine **Rule 13** and adjust it to reflect accurate associations with yield. Consider the position and accessibility of the thiol group on the aromatic ring. Modify the rule to account for factors such as steric hindrance and electronic effects that may affect coordination with the metal center.

- **Advice 10**: **Resolve Overlapping or Conflicting Rules**  
  Identify overlaps between rules that may cause conflicting predictions. For instance, a modifier might satisfy conditions in both a high-yield and a low-yield rule. Establish a hierarchy or priority system where certain rules take precedence, or refine the rules to minimize overlaps.

- **Advice 11**: **Simplify and Generalize Similar Rules**  
  Combine similar rules to increase their applicability and support. For example, merge **Rules 1**, **3**, and **5** into a broader rule about modifiers with multiple coordinating groups (e.g., amino acids with additional carboxyl, amino, or heteroatom functionalities) that enhance yield.

- **Advice 12**: **Enhance Model Generalization and Validate Rules**  
  Ensure that the rules are generalizable and not overly specific to the training data. Validate the refined rules using a separate test set or cross-validation to confirm their predictive power across diverse modifiers.

- **Advice 13**: **Utilize SHAP Analysis for Feature Identification**  
  Incorporate insights from SHAP analysis to identify important features not currently captured by the rules. Use this information to modify existing rules or create new ones that address these significant features, thereby improving model robustness.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing an additional carboxylic acid group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The additional carboxyl group enhances metal coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The short chain length allows effective coordination of both amino and carboxyl groups with minimal steric hindrance. **Modifiers with longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons) result in low yield** due to increased flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination with the metal center. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids where the substituent is a coordinating group (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl)** result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. These groups enhance interaction with the metal center through coordination.

  **Modifiers where the substituent at the para position is a non-coordinating electron-donating group (e.g., methyl)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms (nitrogen or oxygen) adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. The heteroatoms provide additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons without additional polar functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic chain may facilitate favorable interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst. However, similar chain lengths with additional polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) result in **low yield** due to potential interference with optimal coordination. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups within an aliphatic chain, such as sugar acids, alongside a carboxylic acid group** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer) in addition to a carboxyl group** result in **high yield**—for example, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center. However, **modifiers with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. The rigidity of the aromatic ring may hinder effective coordination of the thiol group with the metal center.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid, especially polyether chains**, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may disrupt optimal coordination with the catalyst, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds linking amino acids or functional groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid** result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. Examples include **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**. The adjacent carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in its description, specifying amino acids with side chains containing an additional carboxylic acid group result in high yield. The physico-chemical insight is sound, attributing high yield to enhanced metal coordination due to the additional carboxyl group. The rule considers the combination of amino acid structure with an extra carboxyl group, satisfying complexity. Coverage is adequate with at least two supporting data points (aspartic acid and glutamic acid). The rule achieves a good balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear, distinguishing modifiers based on the chain length of omega-amino acids, specifying those with five carbons or fewer result in high yield, while longer chains result in low yield. The physico-chemical insight is provided, attributing decreased yield to increased flexibility and steric hindrance impacting coordination. The rule combines chain length with the functional group (omega-amino acid), satisfying complexity. Coverage is adequate with supporting data points for both high (5-aminopentanoic acid) and low yield (7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid). The rule maintains a good balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear, defining that para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating substituents result in high yield, whereas those with non-coordinating electron-donating groups result in low yield. The physico-chemical insight is sound, explaining how coordinating groups enhance metal interaction and electron-donating groups reduce acidity and coordination ability. The rule combines multiple sub-structures and functional groups, satisfying complexity. Coverage is strong with several supporting data points for both high and low yield. The rule achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear, identifying modifiers as heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield. The physico-chemical insight explains that heteroatoms provide additional coordination sites, enhancing catalyst binding. The rule involves complex structural considerations, including heteroatoms and their position relative to the carboxyl group. Coverage is adequate with multiple supporting data points. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with 6 to 8 carbons and without extra polar functional groups result in high yield, while similar chains with polar groups result in low yield. The physico-chemical insight suggests hydrophobic interactions aid yield, and polar groups interfere with coordination. The rule combines chain length and functional group absence/presence, adding complexity. Coverage includes one high yield example (octanoic acid) and two low yield examples (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), satisfying the minimum. The rule balances specificity with coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in its description but may lack sufficient coverage with only one supporting data point provided (gluconic acid). The physico-chemical insight is plausible, attributing high yield to enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination due to multiple hydroxyl groups. The rule is complex, considering multiple hydroxyl groups within an aliphatic chain. However, with limited data points, coverage is weak, potentially lowering the rule's overall reliability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in its distinction between thiol groups on short aliphatic chains (high yield) and thiol groups on aromatic rings (low yield). The physico-chemical insight is reasonable, noting thiol groups enhance coordination and that aromatic rigidity may hinder interaction. However, the rule has limited coverage with only one high yield and one low yield example, which may not be sufficient to robustly support the rule. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, adding complexity, but would benefit from more supporting data points.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and provides physico-chemical insight into how ether linkages may disrupt coordination, resulting in low yield. The rule is focused on a specific functional group, satisfying complexity. Coverage is minimal with two data points, which meets the minimum but could be strengthened with additional examples. The balance between specificity and coverage is acceptable but could be improved with more supporting data.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in stating that modifiers with amide bonds result in low yield due to reduced electron density affecting coordination. The physico-chemical insight is plausible. The rule focuses on a specific structural feature, adding complexity. Coverage meets the minimum with two data points but could be enhanced with more examples. The balance between specificity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and provides physico-chemical insight into how perfluoroalkyl groups reduce coordination ability due to electron withdrawal. The rule focuses on a specific structural feature, adding complexity. However, coverage is weak with only one supporting data point, reducing confidence in the rule's universality. The balance between specificity and coverage could be improved with additional examples.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear, detailing that modifiers with additional carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid group result in low yield due to potential competition for metal coordination or unfavorable electronic effects. The rule incorporates specific structural considerations, adding complexity. Coverage meets the minimum with two data points but would benefit from additional examples to strengthen support. The rule balances specificity and coverage adequately but could be improved.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: For rules with limited coverage (e.g., **Rules 6**, **7**, **10**, **13**, **14**, **15**), consider either providing additional supporting data points or merging these rules with similar ones to strengthen their validity. For instance, combine rules about modifiers with coordinating functional groups (like hydroxyl or thiol groups) on short aliphatic chains to create a more generalized rule with broader coverage.

- **Advice 2**: Ensure that all exceptions are clearly addressed within the rules to prevent contradictions with the dataset. For example, in **Rule 3**, explicitly mention exceptions such as modifiers with para-amino substituents (e.g., **4-aminobenzoic acid**) that result in **high yield** despite being electron-donating groups. This improves the rule's accuracy and clarity.

- **Advice 3**: Expand the physicochemical insights within the rules to strengthen the connection between structural features and observed yields. This will enhance understanding and assist in predicting the behavior of new modifiers. For example, elaborate on how specific functional groups influence metal coordination and catalyst interaction.

- **Advice 4**: Reevaluate and potentially merge overlapping rules to improve clarity and reduce redundancy. For example, consider integrating **Rule 10** (perfluoroalkyl groups resulting in low yield) with rules addressing strong electron-withdrawing groups and their effects on coordination ability, thereby improving coverage and applicability.

- **Advice 5**: Reexpress rules to focus on underlying properties (such as steric effects, electronic effects, and coordination ability) rather than specific functional groups. This approach makes the rules more generalizable and easier to apply to a wider range of modifiers. For instance, instead of specifying exact substituents, discuss the impact of electron-donating versus electron-withdrawing effects on metal coordination.

- **Advice 6**: Enhance the dataset by including more modifiers that fit into underrepresented rule categories. This will improve coverage and allow for more robust validation of the rules. Additional data points strengthen the reliability of rules that currently rely on minimal examples.

- **Advice 7**: Emphasize concepts like steric hindrance and molecular flexibility in the rules where applicable. For rules explaining low yield due to long aliphatic chains causing steric hindrance (e.g., **Rule 2**, **Rule 5**), highlight these factors to provide deeper insight into how they influence yield.

- **Advice 8**: Ensure consistency in specifying structural features that correlate with high or low yields across all rules. Avoid ambiguity and clearly define any exceptions to prevent confusion. Consistent language and structure in the rules improve their usability and comprehension.

- **Advice 9**: Consider simplifying overly specific rules by integrating them into broader categories when possible. For example, incorporate **Rule 14** (modifiers with additional carbonyl groups resulting in low yield) into a general rule about modifiers where additional electron-withdrawing groups interfere with metal coordination.

- **Advice 10**: Prioritize rules based on their coverage and relevance to the dataset. Focus on refining and validating rules with strong support, while reassessing or consolidating those with limited data. This approach optimizes the rule set for practical application and reliability.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing an additional carboxylic acid group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups enhances metal coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with short aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The amino and carboxyl groups at opposite ends facilitate effective bidentate coordination with minimal steric hindrance. Conversely, **modifiers with longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids where the substituent is a coordinating group (e.g., amino, nitro)** result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-nitrobenzoic acid**. These groups enhance interaction with the metal center through coordination. In contrast, **modifiers where the substituent at the para position is a non-coordinating electron-donating group (e.g., methyl)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms (nitrogen or oxygen) in the ring adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. The heteroatoms increase electron density and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group and a thiol (-SH) group on a short aliphatic chain (three carbons or fewer)** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center. However, **modifiers with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. The rigidity of the aromatic ring may hinder effective coordination of the thiol group with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid, especially polyether chains**, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may disrupt optimal coordination with the catalyst, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds linking amino acids or functional groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups attached to the carboxylic acid, such as perfluoroalkyl groups**, result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The adjacent carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chain lengths (seven carbons or more) without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic chain may facilitate favorable interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst. However, **similar chain lengths with additional polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino)** result in **low yield** due to potential interference with optimal coordination. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups along with a carboxylic acid group** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst’s active sites.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Adjust the `count_threshold` implementation**. In the current code, the `pat.GetSmarts()` method may return a SMARTS string that doesn't exactly match the original pattern string used as a key in `count_threshold`. This discrepancy can cause the count threshold check to fail. To fix this, store the compiled pattern objects along with their original pattern strings in a way that allows for accurate matching. For example, use a mapping between the original pattern strings and their compiled patterns, and reference the count threshold using the original pattern strings.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Fix the logic in the custom functions for chain length checks**. In the implementation of `check_omega_amino_acid`, the conditions for setting `match` are flawed. The current logic does not correctly handle cases where `min_chain_length` or `max_chain_length` is `None`, or when `chain_length` is `None`. Modify the conditions to:
  - Set `match = True` only when the chain length satisfies the specified `min_chain_length` or `max_chain_length`.
  - Ensure that `match = False` when the chain length does not meet the criteria or is `None`.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Correct the `get_chain_length` function to accurately count carbons in the chain**. Currently, the function may incorrectly count carbons or fail to identify the shortest path between the carboxylic acid carbon and the amine nitrogen. Modify the function to:
  - Ensure that the atom indices correspond correctly to the carboxyl carbon and the amine nitrogen.
  - Accurately count the number of carbon atoms along the chain, excluding the functional group atoms themselves if necessary.
  - Handle cases where no path exists between the two groups by returning a default value or handling `None` appropriately.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Revise the SMARTS patterns to accurately reflect the chemical structures described in the rules**. Some patterns may not correctly identify the intended functional groups or structural features. For instance:
  - **Rule 3**: Update the pattern for para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids to ensure the substituent is at the para position relative to the carboxyl group and is a coordinating group.
  - **Rule 4**: Refine the pattern for heteroaromatic carboxylic acids to accurately capture rings where heteroatoms are adjacent to the carboxyl group.
  - **Rule 5**: Adjust the patterns to correctly distinguish between thiol groups on short aliphatic chains and those directly attached to aromatic rings.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Implement detailed logging or debugging statements**. Add print statements or use a logging framework to output intermediate results, such as:
  - The number of matches found for each pattern.
  - The specific atoms involved in matches.
  - Reasons why a molecule does or does not match a rule.
  This will help identify where the code is failing to capture the rules correctly.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Handle exceptions and edge cases more gracefully**. Ensure that the code does not fail silently when encountering molecules that cannot be parsed or when pattern matching raises exceptions. Include try-except blocks where necessary and provide informative error messages.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Validate the feature matrix against known examples**. Cross-reference the generated feature matrix with the expected outcomes based on the examples provided in the rules. This validation can highlight discrepancies and guide debugging efforts.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Refactor the code for clarity and maintainability**. Organize the code by separating the pattern compilation, rule application, and result aggregation into distinct functions or classes. This modular approach can make the code easier to understand and modify.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing an additional carboxylic acid group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups enhances metal coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with short aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The amino and carboxyl groups at opposite ends facilitate effective bidentate coordination with minimal steric hindrance. Conversely, **modifiers with longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids where the substituent is a coordinating group (e.g., amino, nitro)** result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-nitrobenzoic acid**. These groups enhance interaction with the metal center through coordination. In contrast, **modifiers where the substituent at the para position is a non-coordinating electron-donating group (e.g., methyl)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms (nitrogen or oxygen) in the ring adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. The heteroatoms increase electron density and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group and a thiol (-SH) group on a short aliphatic chain (three carbons or fewer)** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center. However, **modifiers with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. The rigidity of the aromatic ring may hinder effective coordination of the thiol group with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid, especially polyether chains**, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may disrupt optimal coordination with the catalyst, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds linking amino acids or functional groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups attached to the carboxylic acid, such as perfluoroalkyl groups**, result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The adjacent carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chain lengths (seven carbons or more) without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic chain may facilitate favorable interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst. However, **similar chain lengths with additional polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino)** result in **low yield** due to potential interference with optimal coordination. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups along with a carboxylic acid group** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst’s active sites.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: *Correct the hydroxyl group counting in Rule 11.*  
  The current SMARTS pattern for hydroxyl groups `hydroxyl_group_smarts = '[OX2H]'` matches any hydroxyl group, including those in carboxylic acids. This leads to incorrect counting because the hydroxyl group in the carboxylic acid functional group is being counted toward the hydroxyl group threshold. To accurately implement Rule 11, which requires multiple hydroxyl groups **in addition to** the carboxylic acid group, the SMARTS pattern should exclude hydroxyls that are part of carboxylic acids. You can modify the SMARTS pattern to exclude hydroxyls attached to a carbonyl carbon:  
  ```python
  hydroxyl_group_smarts = '[OX2H][#6;!$(C=O)]'
  ```
  This pattern matches hydroxyl groups attached to carbons **not** double-bonded to oxygen, thus excluding the hydroxyl in carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 2**: *Refine the chain length calculation in `get_chain_length` for Rule 2 and Rule 2.1.*  
  The current implementation counts the number of carbon atoms along the shortest path between any carboxylic acid carbon and any amino nitrogen, including paths that go through side chains or rings, which may not represent the actual aliphatic chain length. Modify the function to ensure that only the longest continuous aliphatic chain (without branching or cycles) between the amino group and the carboxylic acid is considered. You can use RDKit's `GetShortestPath` while filtering paths to include only aliphatic (sp³-hybridized) carbons:  
  ```python
  def get_aliphatic_chain_length(mol, acid_atoms, amine_atoms):
      min_length = None
      for a in acid_atoms:
          for b in amine_atoms:
              paths = Chem.rdmolops.GetAllPaths(mol, a, b, useBonds=True)
              for path in paths:
                  # Check if path consists only of aliphatic carbons
                  if all(mol.GetAtomWithIdx(idx).GetHybridization() == Chem.rdchem.HybridizationType.SP3 and mol.GetAtomWithIdx(idx).GetAtomicNum() == 6 for idx in path[1:-1]):
                      num_carbons = len([idx for idx in path[1:-1] if mol.GetAtomWithIdx(idx).GetAtomicNum() == 6])
                      if min_length is None or num_carbons < min_length:
                          min_length = num_carbons
      return min_length
  ```
  Update the `check_omega_amino_acid` logic to use this function and ensure accurate chain length assessment.

- **Suggestion 3**: *Ensure Rule 1 only matches amino acids with side chains containing an additional carboxylic acid group.*  
  The current implementation for Rule 1 checks for at least two carboxylic acid groups and a primary amine but does not ensure that one carboxylic acid is part of the side chain. This can lead to incorrect matches where two carboxylic acids are not on the side chain. Modify Rule 1 to verify that one of the carboxylic acids is on the α-carbon (main chain) and the other is on the side chain. You can do this by identifying the α-carbon and checking for a carboxylic acid attached to it and another carboxylic acid elsewhere:  
  ```python
  # In Rule 1
  'custom_function': 'check_amino_acid_with_side_chain_carboxylic_acid',
  ```
  And implement the custom function:
  ```python
  def check_amino_acid_with_side_chain_carboxylic_acid(mol):
      # Identify the alpha carbon (connected to both amine and carboxylic acid)
      for atom in mol.GetAtoms():
          if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6:
              neighbors = [n.GetAtomicNum() for n in atom.GetNeighbors()]
              if 7 in neighbors and 6 in neighbors:
                  # Check for carboxylic acid on alpha carbon
                  if mol.HasSubstructMatch(Chem.MolFromSmarts('[C](N)(C(=O)O)')):
                      # Check for additional carboxylic acid elsewhere
                      matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(carboxylic_acid_pattern)
                      if len(matches) > 1:
                          return True
      return False
  ```
  This ensures that only amino acids with an additional carboxylic acid in the side chain match Rule 1.

- **Suggestion 4**: *Modify the SMARTS pattern for thiol groups in Rule 5 to ensure proper matching.*  
  The current pattern for thiol groups `thiol_smarts = '[SX2H]'` matches thiol groups but does not distinguish between aliphatic and aromatic attachments. Additionally, the code does not verify the chain length or that the thiol and carboxylic acid are on the same short chain. Update the SMARTS to match thiol groups on aliphatic chains and ensure that the chain length between the thiol and carboxylic acid is three carbons or fewer. For example:  
  ```python
  thiol_smarts = '[CX4][CX4][CX4][SX2H]'  # Thiol on a three-carbon chain
  ```
  And adjust the code to verify that both the carboxylic acid and thiol are connected via a chain of three carbons or fewer.

- **Suggestion 5**: *Perform comprehensive unit tests for each rule and molecule.*  
  Build a test suite where each molecule is checked against each rule with expected outcomes clearly defined. This will help identify discrepancies between the code's logic and the intended rules. For each test case, assert whether the molecule should match the rule and compare it to the code's output. This practice will help ensure that the code accurately implements the rules and make debugging easier.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing an additional carboxylic acid group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups enhances metal coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with short aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The amino and carboxyl groups at opposite ends facilitate effective bidentate coordination with minimal steric hindrance. Conversely, **modifiers with longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids where the substituent is a coordinating group (e.g., amino, nitro)** result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-nitrobenzoic acid**. These groups enhance interaction with the metal center through coordination. In contrast, **modifiers where the substituent at the para position is a non-coordinating electron-donating group (e.g., methyl)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms (nitrogen or oxygen) in the ring adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. The heteroatoms increase electron density and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group and a thiol (-SH) group on a short aliphatic chain (three carbons or fewer)** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center. However, **modifiers with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. The rigidity of the aromatic ring may hinder effective coordination of the thiol group with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid, especially polyether chains**, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may disrupt optimal coordination with the catalyst, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds linking amino acids or functional groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups attached to the carboxylic acid, such as perfluoroalkyl groups**, result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The adjacent carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chain lengths (seven carbons or more) without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic chain may facilitate favorable interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst. However, **similar chain lengths with additional polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino)** result in **low yield** due to potential interference with optimal coordination. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups along with a carboxylic acid group** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst’s active sites.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: In the implementation of **Rule 11**, include the hydroxyl group pattern (`hydroxyl_group_smarts`) in the `'patterns'` list of the rule definition. Currently, only the carboxylic acid pattern is included, which leads to the code incorrectly assigning a value of 1 for **Rule 11** to all molecules containing a carboxylic acid group, regardless of the number of hydroxyl groups. By adding the hydroxyl group pattern to the `'patterns'` list, the code can accurately identify and count the hydroxyl groups present in each molecule.

  **Modified Rule 11 in Code**:

  ```python
  {
      'number': 11,
      'description': 'Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups along with a carboxylic acid group result in high yield.',
      'patterns': [
          {'smarts': carboxylic_acid_smarts, 'pattern': carboxylic_acid_pattern},
          {'smarts': hydroxyl_group_smarts, 'pattern': hydroxyl_group_pattern},
      ],
      'count_threshold': {hydroxyl_group_smarts: 2},
      'prediction': 1
  }
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: Adjust the code logic to correctly associate the `'count_threshold'` with the respective SMARTS patterns. In the current code, the `'count_threshold'` is not applied properly because the hydroxyl group pattern is not included in the `'patterns'` list. Update the code within the main loop to check the `'count_threshold'` for each specific pattern by matching the SMARTS strings.

  **Modified Code in Main Loop**:

  ```python
  for pattern_entry in rule['patterns']:
      pat = pattern_entry['pattern']
      smarts = pattern_entry['smarts']
      matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(pat)
      if matches:
          # Check count threshold
          if 'count_threshold' in rule and smarts in rule['count_threshold']:
              threshold = rule['count_threshold'][smarts]
              if len(matches) >= threshold:
                  continue
              else:
                  match = False
                  break
          else:
              continue  # Pattern matches
      else:
          match = False
          break
  ```

- **Suggestion 3**: For functional groups that require counting (e.g., hydroxyl groups in **Rule 11**), ensure that the SMARTS patterns are correctly defined and specific enough to avoid false positives. For example, refine the `hydroxyl_group_smarts` to exclude hydroxyls that are part of carboxylic acids or other irrelevant functional groups.

  **Refined Hydroxyl Group SMARTS**:

  ```python
  hydroxyl_group_smarts = '[OX2H][#6;!$(C=O);!$(C([OX2H])=O)]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 4**: Review and verify the custom functions used in the code, such as `check_amino_acid_with_side_chain_carboxylic_acid`, to ensure they accurately represent the natural language rules. For instance, in **Rule 1**, confirm that the function correctly identifies amino acids with additional side-chain carboxylic acid groups by checking for multiple carboxylic acids and the presence of an amino group attached to the alpha carbon.

- **Suggestion 5**: Implement additional rules from the original set (e.g., **Rules 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10**) to provide a more comprehensive feature matrix. Including these rules may reduce the number of zeros in the matrix and capture more relevant chemical features that influence the yield.

- **Suggestion 6**: Enhance error handling in the code to provide informative messages when a molecule cannot be parsed or when an exception occurs during pattern matching. This will help identify issues with specific SMILES strings or patterns and improve the robustness of the code.

  **Example Error Handling**:

  ```python
  mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi)
  if mol is None:
      print(f"Warning: Invalid SMILES string '{smi}'.")
      results.append([0]*len(rules))
      continue
  ```

- **Suggestion 7**: Incorporate unit tests for each rule to verify that the code correctly identifies whether a molecule matches the rule. This can be done by creating test cases with known outcomes and ensuring that the code produces the expected feature matrix entries.

   - **Current Train Leverage:** 0.0048
   - **Previous Train Leverage:** Positive value of 0.0289 and a negative value of -0.0041
   - **Interpretation:** The leverage measures the difference between the observed co-occurrence of the rule conditions and the outcome versus what would be expected by chance. The current leverage is positive but small, indicating a slight improvement over chance but less than previous positive leverage values.

5. **Test Metrics:** The current metrics provided do not include test metrics for the current rules, whereas previous metrics included test support, confidence, lift, and leverage.

---

**Overall Interpretation:**

- **Improved Confidence and Lift:** The increase in train confidence and lift suggests that the current rules are more effective at predicting high-yield outcomes when their conditions are met. The higher lift value indicates a stronger association between the conditions and the outcome compared to previous rules.
  
- **Reduced Support:** The decreased support implies that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the data. While the rules are more accurate when they apply, their applicability is limited.
  
- **Leverage Consideration:** The current leverage is positive but lower than the highest previous value. This suggests a modest improvement over chance but indicates that the rules might not capture as much of the underlying association as possible.
  
- **Lack of Test Metrics:** Without test metrics for the current rules, it's challenging to assess their generalizability and performance on unseen data. The previous rules showed a significant drop in performance from training to testing data, which could indicate overfitting.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

Given that the confidence and lift have improved but support has decreased, it suggests that the algorithm might be overfitting to specific subsets of the data. The absence of test metrics makes it difficult to conclusively determine if a local minimum has been reached.

- **Local Minimum:** It's possible that a local minimum has been reached concerning confidence and lift on training data. However, without test data evaluation, it's uncertain if these rules will perform well on new data.
  
- **Number of Iterations:** There may still be room for improvement, especially in increasing the support and ensuring that the rules generalize better. Additional iterations focusing on balancing support, confidence, and lift could be beneficial.

---

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Increase Rule Support:**
   - **Objective:** Broaden the applicability of the rules to cover a larger portion of the data.
   - **Strategy:** Generalize some of the conditions in the rules to include more examples without significantly sacrificing confidence and lift. This might involve combining similar rules or relaxing overly specific criteria.

2. **Validate with Test Data:**
   - **Importance:** Assessing the rules on test data is crucial to ensure they generalize well and are not overfitting to the training data.
   - **Action:** Calculate test support, confidence, lift, and leverage for the current rules to evaluate their performance on unseen data.

3. **Balance Complexity and Generalization:**
   - **Issue with Current Rules:** Some rules may be too specific (e.g., Rule 5 contrasts thiol groups on short aliphatic chains vs. aromatic rings).
   - **Solution:** Simplify rules where possible to reduce complexity. For example, instead of specifying chain lengths, focus on the presence of functional groups and their general impact on yield.

4. **Re-evaluate Rule Conditions:**
   - **Analysis:** Some rules may contradict or overlap, potentially causing confusion or reducing overall effectiveness.
   - **Action:** Identify overlapping rules and consolidate them. Ensure that each rule adds unique value and does not conflict with others.

5. **Incorporate Feature Importance:**
   - **Approach:** Use statistical methods or machine learning models to identify which features (functional groups, chain lengths, electronic effects) are most predictive of high yield.
   - **Application:** Refine rules to emphasize the most significant features, potentially improving confidence and lift while also increasing support.

6. **Include Negative Examples:**
   - **Observation:** Current rules focus heavily on conditions leading to high yield but may benefit from more explicitly defining conditions leading to low yield.
   - **Enhancement:** Develop rules that more accurately predict low yield outcomes, improving the overall predictive capability of the rule set.

7. **Cross-Validation:**
   - **Purpose:** Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of the rules across different subsets of the data.
   - **Benefit:** This helps to ensure that the rules are robust and not overly reliant on any particular portion of the data.

8. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - **Process:** Continue to iterate on rule development, using feedback from metric evaluations to guide adjustments.
   - **Focus Areas:** Aim to improve leverage and maintain high confidence and lift while gradually increasing support.

---

**Conclusion and Next Steps:**

- The current rules show improved confidence and lift on the training data, indicating stronger predictive power when the rules apply.
  
- However, the reduced support and lack of test metrics suggest potential overfitting and limited applicability.
  
- To enhance the performance of the rules:
  - Broaden their applicability to increase support.
  - Validate and adjust the rules based on test data performance.
  - Simplify and consolidate rules to reduce complexity and potential overlaps.
  - Utilize statistical analyses to focus on the most impactful features.
  
- **Recommendation:** Proceed with further iterations, incorporating the above suggestions to develop a rule set that balances coverage (support), accuracy (confidence), and strength of association (lift and leverage) while ensuring generalizability to new data.

---

By implementing these improvements, we aim to develop a more robust and effective set of rules that accurately predict high-yield outcomes and are applicable to a broader range of scenarios within the research program.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation Set and Training Set:**

The current 5-fold cross-validation accuracy obtained using the classification model is **approximately 51.4%** (0.5143). This is a significant decrease compared to previous validation accuracies, which were consistently around **76%**. Here's a comparison for clarity:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies:** [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75

- **Current Validation Accuracy:** 0.5143

This substantial drop in accuracy suggests that the current set of rules is not as effective in predicting the loading of modifiers on the catalyst compared to previous iterations.

**Analysis Based on the SHAP Value Calculated on the Validation:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions. In the current SHAP analysis, only **Rule 5** is influencing the predictions, with a SHAP value of approximately **0.0185** for the majority of the molecules:

- For all molecules, **Rule 5 SHAP value for high loading: 0.0185**
- In some cases, **Rule 5 SHAP value for high loading: 0.0**

This uniform SHAP value indicates that **Rule 5 is the only active rule** contributing to the model's decisions, and its contribution is relatively small. Additionally, this suggests that other rules are either inactive or have negligible influence on the predictions.

**Observations from SHAP Analysis:**

1. **Limited Rule Influence:** The model relies solely on **Rule 5**, disregarding other rules. This over-reliance could be causing the model to miss critical information captured by other rules in previous iterations.

2. **Consistent SHAP Values:** The identical SHAP values across different molecules imply that the model is not differentiating between them based on their features, leading to poor predictive performance.

3. **Lack of Model Complexity:** The minimal contribution from a single rule points toward an oversimplified model that lacks the necessary complexity to capture the underlying patterns in the data.

**Evaluation of the Current Rules:**

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

   - The current rules are **not effective enough**, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy. The model's performance has deteriorated, indicating that the rules are insufficient to capture the complexities of the catalyst-modifier interactions.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**

   - The model is likely **underfitting**. The significant drop in accuracy suggests that the model is too simplistic and cannot accurately model the relationships in the data. Over-reliance on a single rule (Rule 5) without contributions from other rules supports this conclusion.

3. **Discrepancy Analysis:**

   - **Overestimated Loadings:**
     - For molecules where the predicted loading is **high** but the experimental value is **low**, **Rule 5** (with a positive SHAP value) is likely contributing incorrectly to the prediction.
     - Examples:
       - *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*: Predicted high, experimental low.
       - *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*: Predicted high, experimental low.
   - **Underestimated Loadings:**
     - For molecules where the predicted loading is **low** but the experimental value is **high**, the absence of positive contributions from other relevant rules might be causing underestimation.
     - However, in the current analysis, all molecules are predicted with high loading due to the uniform SHAP value from Rule 5.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Decline:**

   - The decline in accuracy indicates that the current rules have not improved the model. Instead, they have reduced its predictive capability, suggesting that important features captured by previous rules are no longer being considered.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

   - The SHAP analysis highlights the overemphasis on **Rule 5** and ignores other potentially significant rules.
   - The limited variation in SHAP values across different molecules suggests that the model lacks the ability to discriminate based on molecular features.

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Reintroduce and Refine Previously Effective Rules:**

   - **Reevaluate Removed Rules:** Reconsider the rules that were present in previous iterations (e.g., Rules 3, 10, 12, 13) which might have contributed positively to the model's performance.
   - **Enhance Rule Definitions:** Ensure that the rules are clearly defined and capture the necessary chemical features influencing catalyst loading.

2. **Balance Model Complexity:**

   - **Avoid Oversimplification:** While simplification can prevent overfitting, oversimplifying by relying on a single rule leads to underfitting. Introduce multiple relevant rules to increase model complexity appropriately.
   - **Ensure Diverse Feature Representation:** Include rules that cover different chemical properties and functional groups to allow the model to capture a wide range of molecular influences.

3. **Adjust Problematic Rules Based on SHAP Values:**

   - **Refine Rule 5:** Since Rule 5 is contributing to incorrect high loading predictions, reassess its criteria. Modify the rule to be more specific or consider additional conditions to prevent misclassification.
   - **Incorporate Negative SHAP Values:** Identify and adjust rules that might contribute negatively to predictions when they should be positive (and vice versa).

4. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors:**

   - **Use Quantitative Features:** Beyond categorical rules, consider incorporating quantitative descriptors such as molecular weight, logP, or electronic properties to enhance the model's predictive power.
   - **Leverage Substructure Patterns:** Utilize SMARTS patterns or molecular fingerprints to capture subtle substructural variations influencing activity.

5. **Iterative Model Refinement with SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Iteratively Evaluate Rule Impact:** After adjusting the rules, use SHAP analysis in each iteration to assess the contribution of each rule and ensure they are influencing predictions appropriately.
   - **Targeted Rule Adjustment:** Focus on rules with high positive SHAP values in overestimated cases and high negative SHAP values in underestimated cases to fine-tune their definitions.

6. **Prevent Overfitting and Underfitting:**

   - **Cross-Validation Techniques:** Continue using cross-validation to monitor model performance and adjust complexity accordingly.
   - **Regularization Methods:** If necessary, apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting while maintaining sufficient model complexity.

7. **Domain Expertise Collaboration:**

   - **Consult Chemists:** Collaborate with chemists to verify that the rules make sense chemically and reflect true interactions between modifiers and catalysts.
   - **Update Rules Based on Experimental Data:** Incorporate new experimental findings to refine rules and ensure they are grounded in empirical evidence.

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules is insufficient, leading to decreased model performance due to underfitting. By reintroducing previously effective rules, refining existing ones (especially Rule 5), and ensuring a balanced model complexity, we can improve the model's accuracy. Leveraging SHAP analysis in an iterative manner will help fine-tune the rules and enhance their effectiveness in predicting catalyst modifier loadings.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

**Summary of Discussions:**

- **Current Rule Performance:** The current set of rules shows a train support of approximately **9.5%**, a train confidence of **66.9%**, and a lift of **1.33**. While the confidence and lift have improved compared to previous iterations, the support has decreased, indicating that the rules apply to a smaller subset of data.

- **Validation Accuracy Drop:** The 5-fold cross-validation accuracy has significantly decreased to **51.4%** from previous accuracies of around **76%**. This suggests that the current rules are not effectively predicting the yield of the reaction across the dataset.

- **SHAP Analysis Insights:** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis reveals that **only Rule 5** is influencing the model's predictions, with minimal contribution. Other rules are inactive or have negligible influence, leading to an over-reliance on a single rule and a lack of model complexity.

- **Underfitting Issue:** The model appears to be **underfitting**, as it lacks the necessary complexity to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The reliance on a single rule indicates that important features influencing the catalytic activity are being missed.

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules and Suggestions:**

1. **Reintroduce Previously Effective Rules:**
   - **Action:** Reincorporate rules from earlier iterations that showed positive contributions to the model's performance, such as **Rules 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10**.
   - **Benefit:** These rules may capture essential chemical features and increase the model's ability to differentiate between high and low yield modifiers.

2. **Increase Rule Support and Applicability:**
   - **Action:** Generalize overly specific rules to broaden their applicability without significantly sacrificing confidence and lift.
   - **Example:** Modify rules that are too restrictive by relaxing certain conditions, allowing them to cover more molecules and increase support.

3. **Balance Model Complexity:**
   - **Action:** Introduce multiple relevant rules to avoid over-reliance on a single rule and enhance the model's complexity appropriately.
   - **Benefit:** A balanced set of rules can better capture the diversity of chemical features influencing the reaction yield.

4. **Refine Existing Rules:**
   - **Action:** Reevaluate and adjust the definitions of existing rules, ensuring they align accurately with the chemical properties they aim to represent.
   - **Example:** For **Rule 5**, which focuses on thiol groups, refine the criteria to prevent misclassification of modifiers with low experimental yields.

5. **Enhance Rule Implementation in Code:**
   - **Action:** Ensure that the code correctly implements the rules, especially those involving counting functional groups or patterns.
   - **Example:** In **Rule 11**, include the hydroxyl group pattern in the code and properly apply the count threshold to accurately identify molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups.

6. **Incorporate Quantitative Molecular Descriptors:**
   - **Action:** Utilize quantitative features such as molecular weight, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), and electronic properties in the model.
   - **Benefit:** Quantitative descriptors can capture subtle differences between molecules that categorical rules might miss, improving predictive accuracy.

7. **Leverage SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement:**
   - **Action:** Use SHAP analysis iteratively to assess the impact of each rule on the model's predictions and adjust the rules accordingly.
   - **Benefit:** This helps identify rules that contribute positively or negatively to predictions, allowing for targeted refinements.

8. **Ensure Rules Do Not Overlap or Contradict:**
   - **Action:** Review the rules to identify and resolve any overlaps or contradictions that might confuse the model.
   - **Example:** Consolidate similar rules and clarify conditions to enhance the cohesiveness of the rule set.

9. **Include Negative Examples in Rule Development:**
   - **Action:** Develop rules that accurately predict low-yield outcomes, not just high-yield ones.
   - **Benefit:** Including negative examples strengthens the model's overall predictive capability by providing a more balanced perspective.

10. **Cross-Validation and Testing:**
    - **Action:** Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate rule performance across different data subsets and prevent overfitting.
    - **Benefit:** Ensures that the rules are robust and generalize well to unseen data.

11. **Collaborate with Domain Experts:**
    - **Action:** Consult with chemists or catalysis experts to validate the chemical relevance of the rules.
    - **Benefit:** Domain expertise can provide insights that enhance the accuracy and applicability of the rules.

12. **Iterative Rule Optimization:**
    - **Action:** Continue refining the rules based on performance metrics, aiming to improve support, confidence, and lift without sacrificing one for the others.
    - **Benefit:** Iterative optimization leads to a more effective and reliable set of rules over time.

**Judgment on Further Optimization Possibility**

Based on the analysis, there is significant room for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current model is underfitting due to an oversimplified rule set that fails to capture the complexity of the data. By implementing the suggestions above, the rules can be improved to increase their applicability (support), predictive accuracy (confidence), and strength of association (lift and leverage) while maintaining generalizability to new data.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing an additional carboxylic acid group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups enhances metal coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino acids with short aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The amino and carboxyl groups at opposite ends facilitate effective bidentate coordination with minimal steric hindrance. Conversely, **modifiers with longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids where the substituent is a coordinating group (e.g., amino, nitro)** result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-nitrobenzoic acid**. These groups enhance interaction with the metal center through coordination. In contrast, **modifiers where the substituent at the para position is a non-coordinating electron-donating group (e.g., methyl)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms (nitrogen or oxygen) in the ring adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. The heteroatoms increase electron density and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group and a thiol (-SH) group on a short aliphatic chain (three carbons or fewer)** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center. However, **modifiers with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. The rigidity of the aromatic ring may hinder effective coordination of the thiol group with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid, especially polyether chains**, result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may disrupt optimal coordination with the catalyst, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing amide bonds linking amino acids or functional groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups attached to the carboxylic acid, such as perfluoroalkyl groups**, result in **low yield**. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The adjacent carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chain lengths (seven carbons or more) without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic chain may facilitate favorable interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst. However, **similar chain lengths with additional polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino)** result in **low yield** due to potential interference with optimal coordination. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups along with a carboxylic acid group** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst’s active sites.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Reintroduce Previously Effective Rules**

  - **Action**: Incorporate Rules **3**, **4**, **6**, **7**, **8**, **9**, and **10** back into the current rule set.
  - **Implementation**: Review these rules for accuracy and relevance, then add them to the existing rules to expand the model's ability to capture critical chemical features influencing yield.
  - **Benefit**: These rules previously showed positive contributions and will enhance the model's predictive power by covering more chemical variations.

- **Advice 2**: **Increase Rule Support by Generalizing Specific Conditions**

  - **Action**: Modify overly specific rules to broaden their applicability.
  - **Example**:
    - In **Rule 2**, adjust the chain length condition to include **omega-amino acids with aliphatic chains of six carbons or fewer** instead of five.
    - This change will include compounds like **6-aminocaproic acid**, increasing support.
  - **Benefit**: Generalizing conditions allows the rules to cover more modifiers, increasing the model's support without significantly reducing confidence.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Existing Rules to Improve Accuracy**

  - **Action**: Reevaluate and adjust the definitions of current rules for better alignment with chemical properties.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Rule 5**:
      - Refine to specify that **modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group and a thiol (-SH) group on an aliphatic chain (three to six carbons)** result in **high yield**.
      - Clarify that **thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings or hindered environments** result in **low yield**.
    - **Rule 11**:
      - Ensure the rule includes modifiers with **three or more hydroxyl (-OH) groups**.
      - Modify the rule to state that **multiple hydroxyl groups (three or more) along with a carboxylic acid group** result in **high yield**.
  - **Benefit**: Refining rules improves their specificity and prevents misclassification, enhancing model accuracy.

- **Advice 4**: **Enhance Rule Implementation in Code**

  - **Action**: Verify and correct the code implementation for all rules, focusing on pattern recognition and functional group counting.
  - **Examples**:
    - For **Rule 11**, implement code to count the number of hydroxyl groups and apply a threshold (e.g., three or more).
    - For rules involving aromatic rings or specific substituents, ensure SMILES patterns correctly identify the structures.
  - **Benefit**: Accurate code implementation ensures that rules correctly classify modifiers, improving model reliability.

- **Advice 5**: **Balance Model Complexity by Introducing Multiple Relevant Rules**

  - **Action**: Avoid over-reliance on a single rule by ensuring all relevant rules are active and contribute to predictions.
  - **Implementation**:
    - After reintroducing and refining rules, check their activity using SHAP analysis.
    - Adjust rules as necessary to ensure they collectively cover different aspects of the data.
  - **Benefit**: A balanced rule set captures the diversity of chemical features affecting yield, reducing underfitting.

- **Advice 6**: **Develop Rules for Low-Yield Modifiers**

  - **Action**: Create new rules that specifically predict **low-yield** outcomes based on structural features.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy) attached to an aromatic ring** result in **low yield** due to reduced metal coordination.
    - **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield** because amide formation decreases electron density on coordinating atoms.
  - **Benefit**: Including rules for low-yield modifiers provides a balanced model that can accurately predict both high and low outcomes.

- **Advice 7**: **Leverage SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement**

  - **Action**: Use SHAP analysis to assess the impact of each rule and prioritize refinements.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Identify rules with minimal contribution and investigate reasons (e.g., too narrow, misimplemented).
    - Refine or remove underperforming rules based on insights.
  - **Benefit**: Focuses efforts on rules that improve model performance, enhancing predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 8**: **Ensure Rules Do Not Overlap or Contradict**

  - **Action**: Review all rules to identify overlaps and contradictions, and adjust as needed.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Create a matrix mapping modifiers to applied rules to spot conflicts.
    - Consolidate similar rules or specify hierarchies where one rule takes precedence over another.
  - **Benefit**: Eliminates confusion within the model, leading to consistent and accurate predictions.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Quantitative Molecular Descriptors**

  - **Action**: Integrate quantitative features like molecular weight, logP, and electronic properties into the rules.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Develop new rules that include thresholds for these descriptors.
    - Example: Modifiers with a logP value between X and Y result in high yield due to optimal solubility.
  - **Benefit**: Captures subtle molecular differences affecting yield, enhancing rule comprehensiveness.

- **Advice 10**: **Iterative Rule Optimization with Cross-Validation**

  - **Action**: Continuously test and refine the rules using cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
  - **Implementation**:
    - After each set of changes, perform cross-validation to assess performance.
    - Use results to inform further refinements.
  - **Benefit**: Ensures that rules generalize well to new data, improving long-term model performance.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with an additional carboxylic acid group (amino dicarboxylic acids)** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites, enhancing binding to the metal center of the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a primary amino group located on a short aliphatic chain of five carbons or fewer (short-chain omega-amino acids)** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates effective bidentate coordination with minimal steric hindrance. Conversely, **similar amino acids with longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and steric hindrance reducing effective coordination. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating coordinating groups such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxy (-OH) groups at the para position** result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. These groups enhance interaction with the metal center through coordination. In contrast, **modifiers where the substituent at the para position is a non-coordinating group (e.g., methyl group)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. Electron-donating but non-coordinating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO₂) at the para position** result in **high yield**. An example is **4-nitrobenzoic acid**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. The nitrogen atoms increase electron density and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group and a thiol (-SH) group on a short aliphatic chain (three carbons or fewer)** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain may facilitate favorable interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, enhancing binding.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages, especially polyether chains extending from the carboxylic acid** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may disrupt optimal coordination with the catalyst by introducing flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with amide bonds linking functional groups or amino acids (containing amide linkages)** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing groups attached to the carboxylic acid, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The adjacent carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups along with a carboxylic acid group on an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst’s active sites.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with heteroaromatic substituents at the para position** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. The steric hindrance and electronic effects of the bulky heteroaromatic group may impede effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with phenolic groups attached to a propanoic acid chain (where the hydroxyphenyl group is not directly attached to the carboxyl group)** result in **low yield**. An example is **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**. The increased distance between the phenolic hydroxyl group and the carboxyl group may reduce the overall coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains (aromatic rings)** result in **low yield**. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine). The bulky side chain may cause steric hindrance, preventing optimal interaction with the catalyst.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with an additional carboxylic acid group (amino dicarboxylic acids)** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites, enhancing binding to the metal center of the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a primary amino group located on a short aliphatic chain of five carbons or fewer (short-chain omega-amino acids)** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates effective bidentate coordination with minimal steric hindrance. Conversely, **similar amino acids with longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and steric hindrance reducing effective coordination. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating coordinating groups such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxy (-OH) groups at the para position** result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. These groups enhance interaction with the metal center through coordination. In contrast, **modifiers where the substituent at the para position is a non-coordinating group (e.g., methyl group)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. Electron-donating but non-coordinating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO₂) at the para position** result in **high yield**. An example is **4-nitrobenzoic acid**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. The nitrogen atoms increase electron density and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group and a thiol (-SH) group on a short aliphatic chain (three carbons or fewer)** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain may facilitate favorable interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, enhancing binding.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages, especially polyether chains extending from the carboxylic acid** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may disrupt optimal coordination with the catalyst by introducing flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with amide bonds linking functional groups or amino acids (containing amide linkages)** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing groups attached to the carboxylic acid, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The adjacent carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups along with a carboxylic acid group on an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst’s active sites.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with heteroaromatic substituents at the para position** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. The steric hindrance and electronic effects of the bulky heteroaromatic group may impede effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with phenolic groups attached to a propanoic acid chain (where the hydroxyphenyl group is not directly attached to the carboxyl group)** result in **low yield**. An example is **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**. The increased distance between the phenolic hydroxyl group and the carboxyl group may reduce the overall coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains (aromatic rings)** result in **low yield**. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine). The bulky side chain may cause steric hindrance, preventing optimal interaction with the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: *Generalize SMARTS Patterns for Broader Matching*

  The SMARTS patterns specified for each rule are often too specific, matching only exact substructures or specific examples rather than capturing the broader structural features described in the natural language rules. To improve the effectiveness of the transformation, the SMARTS patterns should be generalized to match any molecule that fits the criteria outlined in the rules.

  For example, in Rule 2, the patterns specify exact chain lengths using explicit `[CH2]` groups. Instead, use SMARTS syntax that allows for variable chain lengths within the desired range. Adjust the patterns to capture any aliphatic chain of five carbons or fewer connecting the amino and carboxylic acid groups.

- **Suggestion 2**: *Use Variable Repeats and Appropriate Wildcards in SMARTS*

  Incorporate variable repeats and appropriate wildcard atoms in the SMARTS patterns to make them more flexible. For instance, for aliphatic chains, use the `{}` operator to specify the number of repeats, and use `[CH2]` or `[CH]` as needed.

  **For Rule 2**:
  - Replace the multiple patterns for different chain lengths with a single pattern using variable repeats:
    - `'[NX3H2]-[CH2]{1,5}-C(=O)[OX2H1]'` for chain lengths of 1 to 5 carbons.

  **For Rule 2.1**:
  - Use:
    - `'[NX3H2]-[CH2]{6,}-C(=O)[OX2H1]'` for chains longer than five carbons.

- **Suggestion 3**: *Modify Aromatic Ring Patterns to Allow for Substituent Variability*

  In rules involving aromatic compounds (e.g., Rules 3, 4, and 13), the patterns are too restrictive, matching only specific compounds. To generalize:

  **For Rule 3**:
  - Adjust the pattern to match any para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acid with an electron-donating group:
    - `'c1ccc(cc1)-C(=O)[OX2H1]'` with a condition that the substituent at the para position is an `amino` or `hydroxy` group.

  - Use atom mapping or labels to ensure the substituent is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

  **Example SMARTS**:
  - `'c1cc([#8H0,#7H1,H2])ccc1C(=O)[OX2H1]'` where `[#8H0,#7H1,H2]` matches hydroxy or amino groups.

- **Suggestion 4**: *Include Explicit Positioning in Aromatic Substitutions*

  When specifying positions on aromatic rings, use SMARTS to define relative positions explicitly. Use numbering or ring definitions to indicate the positions of substituents.

  **For Rule 3 and Rule 4**:
  - Use patterns like:
    - `'c1cc([!H])ccc1C(=O)[OX2H1]'` and then check that the substituent is at the para position compared to the carboxylic acid group.

  **Implement positional checks** by using query atoms with numbering:

  - `'c1c([#8H,#7H2])cccc1C(=O)[OX2H1]'` with the hydroxy or amino group in the para position relative to the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 5**: *Ensure Exclusion Patterns Correctly Prevent Matches in Rule 7*

  For rules that exclude certain functional groups (e.g., Rule 7), verify that the exclusion patterns are correctly specified.

  **For Rule 7**:
  - The current exclusion patterns may not be functioning properly. Ensure that the exclusion patterns for amino, hydroxyl, and thiol groups are correctly matched.

  **Example**:
  - Exclude molecules containing amino groups:
    - `'[NX3;!$(N[C]=O)]'`
  - Exclude molecules containing hydroxyl groups:
    - `'[OX2H]'`
  - Exclude molecules containing thiol groups:
    - `'[SX2H]'`

  Use these in the `exclude_patterns` list and ensure that the matching logic correctly prevents Rule 7 from matching molecules with these groups.

- **Suggestion 6**: *Add Comprehensive Test Cases and Validation*

  Include known examples that should match each rule and verify that the SMARTS patterns correctly identify them. For molecules that are known to fit a rule but are not being matched, adjust the SMARTS patterns accordingly.

  - **For Rule 2**: Test with SMILES of known short-chain omega-amino acids like 5-aminopentanoic acid.

  - **For Rule 5**: Use examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid) and ensure the SMARTS pattern matches heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen adjacent to the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 7**: *Handle Tautomers and Protonation States*

  Consider that some functional groups can exist in different tautomeric forms or protonation states, which may not be captured by the current SMARTS patterns.

  - Use more general SMARTS patterns or include alternative forms to account for tautomers.

  - **Example**:
    - For carboxylic acids, you might need to match both `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` and `[CX3](=O)[O-]`.

- **Suggestion 8**: *Refine Patterns for Functional Group Identification*

  Verify that the SMARTS patterns accurately represent the functional groups as per standard definitions.

  - **For Thiol Groups in Rule 6**:
    - Ensure that `[SX2H]` correctly identifies thiol groups, and that they are connected to short aliphatic chains.

  - **For Ketones and Aldehydes in Rule 11**:
    - Adjust patterns to match carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 9**: *Improve Pattern Matching Logic in the Code*

  When checking for matches, ensure that all compiled patterns are evaluated correctly.

  - In the code, ensure that when multiple patterns are provided for a rule, the molecule is considered a match if it matches any of the patterns (logical OR).

  - Similarly, when multiple conditions need to be met (logical AND), ensure that the code reflects this.

- **Suggestion 10**: *Optimize the Use of RDKit Functions for Substructure Matching*

  Utilize RDKit's capabilities for substructure search more effectively.

  - Use `Mol.GetSubstructMatches()` to find all matches and check counts when necessary.

  - Use `AllChem.ReplaceSidechains()` or other relevant RDKit functions for more complex matching.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with an additional carboxylic acid group (amino dicarboxylic acids)** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites, enhancing binding to the metal center of the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a primary amino group located on a short aliphatic chain of five carbons or fewer (short-chain omega-amino acids)** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates effective bidentate coordination with minimal steric hindrance. Conversely, **similar amino acids with longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and steric hindrance reducing effective coordination. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating coordinating groups such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxy (-OH) groups at the para position** result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. These groups enhance interaction with the metal center through coordination. In contrast, **modifiers where the substituent at the para position is a non-coordinating group (e.g., methyl group)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. Electron-donating but non-coordinating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO₂) at the para position** result in **high yield**. An example is **4-nitrobenzoic acid**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. The nitrogen atoms increase electron density and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group and a thiol (-SH) group on a short aliphatic chain (three carbons or fewer)** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain may facilitate favorable interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, enhancing binding.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages, especially polyether chains extending from the carboxylic acid** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may disrupt optimal coordination with the catalyst by introducing flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with amide bonds linking functional groups or amino acids (containing amide linkages)** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing groups attached to the carboxylic acid, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The adjacent carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups along with a carboxylic acid group on an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst’s active sites.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with heteroaromatic substituents at the para position** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. The steric hindrance and electronic effects of the bulky heteroaromatic group may impede effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with phenolic groups attached to a propanoic acid chain (where the hydroxyphenyl group is not directly attached to the carboxyl group)** result in **low yield**. An example is **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**. The increased distance between the phenolic hydroxyl group and the carboxyl group may reduce the overall coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains (aromatic rings)** result in **low yield**. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine). The bulky side chain may cause steric hindrance, preventing optimal interaction with the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **For Rule 1**, verify that the SMARTS patterns and `min_counts` accurately reflect the requirement of at least **two carboxylic acid groups** and **one amino group**. Currently, the code uses `carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` and `amino_group = '[NX3;H2,H1]'`, which are appropriate, but ensure that the `min_counts` dictionary enforces exactly **two** carboxylic acids. Additionally, consider specifying that the amino group and carboxylic acids are on the same aliphatic chain to distinguish amino dicarboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 2**: **For Rule 2**, the SMARTS pattern `'[NX3H2]-{short_chain}-C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` may not correctly capture **omega-amino acids** with the amino group and carboxylic acid separated by a short aliphatic chain. Modify the pattern to `'[NX3H2]-[CH2]{1,5}-C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to specify that the chain length between the amino group and carboxylic acid is **five carbons or fewer**. Similarly, for **Rule 2.1**, adjust the pattern to `'[NX3H2]-[CH2]{6,}-C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to represent chains longer than five carbons.

- **Suggestion 3**: **For Rule 3**, the patterns `'c1cc([NX3;H2,H1])ccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` and `'c1cc([OX2H])ccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` only match specific cases where the substituent is directly attached to the benzene ring at the para position. To make the pattern more flexible, use recursive SMARTS or introduce variables to ensure that the **electron-donating groups** (amino or hydroxy) are at the **para position** relative to the carboxylic acid. For example, use `'c1cc([#7X3H2,#8X2H])ccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 4**: **For Rule 4**, the SMARTS pattern `'c1cc([NX3](=O)=O)ccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` is too specific and only matches nitro groups attached directly to the ring. To broaden the pattern to include other electron-withdrawing groups at the para position, such as cyano (-CN) or trifluoromethyl (-CF₃) groups, modify the pattern to `'c1cc([$(N(=O)=O),$(C#N),$(C(F)(F)F)])ccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 5**: **For Rule 5**, ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately match **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group**. The current patterns `'[nH1]1cccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` and `'[nH1]1ccnc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` may not capture all relevant heterocycles. Consider using a more general pattern like `'n1cccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to include both protonated and non-protonated nitrogen atoms.

- **Suggestion 6**: **For Rule 11**, the patterns `'[CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` and `'[CX3](=O)[CH](=O)'` may not effectively match molecules with a carbonyl group adjacent to a carboxylic acid. The first pattern looks for adjacent carbonyl carbons (which is less common), and the second pattern does not ensure adjacency to the carboxylic acid. Modify the pattern to match an **aldehyde group adjacent to a carboxylic acid** on an aromatic ring. For example, use `'[c][CX3H](=O)[c]C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to match compounds like 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Suggestion 7**: **For Rule 12**, refine the SMARTS patterns to ensure that only **aliphatic chains with multiple hydroxyl groups and a carboxylic acid** are matched. The current implementation may incorrectly assign molecules with random hydroxyl groups elsewhere. Use a pattern like `'[CX4H2][OX2H][CX4H][OX2H][CX4H][OX2H][CX4H][OX2H][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to match compounds like gluconic acid specifically.

- **Suggestion 8**: **For Rule 13**, the pattern `'c1cc([a])ccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` is invalid because `[a]` is not a recognized SMARTS atom primitive. Replace `[a]` with a pattern that matches heteroaromatic substituents at the para position. For example, use `'c1cc([cR2])ccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` where `[cR2]` represents a fused heteroaromatic ring or adjust the pattern to match specific heterocycles like pyridine: `'c1cc([nX2H0])ccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 9**: **For Rule 14**, the current pattern `'[OX2H]c1ccccc1CCC(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` may be too rigid. To match **phenolic groups attached to a propanoic acid chain**, use a more flexible pattern that allows for varying chain lengths but ensures the hydroxyphenyl group is not directly attached to the carboxyl group. Modify the pattern to `'[OX2H]c1ccccc1CC[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 10**: **For Rule 15**, the patterns `'[NX3;H2][CH](c1ccccc1)[C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` and `'[NX3;H2][CH](c1ccncc1)[C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` only match amino acids with specific aromatic side chains. To generalize the pattern to include all amino acids with **bulky hydrophobic aromatic side chains**, use a pattern like `'[NX3;H2][CH](c1ccccn1|c1ccccc1)[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`, or even more generally, `'[NX3;H2][CH](c[c])C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 11**: **For Rule 9**, the pattern for **amide linkages** `'[NX3][CX3](=O)[NX3,#6]'` might be too general or miss certain amide configurations. Ensure that it captures amide bonds linking functional groups or amino acids by including additional context or specifying the types of atoms connected to the nitrogen atoms. Possibly use `'[CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3](=O)'` to match linkages in peptides.

- **Suggestion 12**: **For Rule 8**, to accurately identify **polyether chains extending from the carboxylic acid**, consider using a recursive SMARTS pattern that matches any number of ether linkages. For example, use `'[CX3](=O)[OX2][CH2][OX2][CH2][OX2][CH2]'` to match repeating units, or more generally, `'[CX3](=O)[OX2]([CH2][OX2])*[CH2]C'`.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Verify the matching process for each SMILES**. Some modifiers may not be correctly identified due to incorrect SMARTS patterns or parsing issues. For instance, in the feature matrix, the first SMILES (`'C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)C(=O)O'`) does not match Rule 11, even though it contains an aldehyde adjacent to a carboxylic acid, as specified in Rule 11.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Include error handling and logging** in the code to capture exceptions and invalid patterns. This will help identify issues with SMARTS patterns that fail to compile or SMILES strings that cannot be parsed.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Test the code with known examples** from each rule to ensure that the patterns correctly identify the modifiers. Use the examples provided in the rules section as test cases.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with an additional carboxylic acid group (amino dicarboxylic acids)** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites, enhancing binding to the metal center of the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a primary amino group located on a short aliphatic chain of five carbons or fewer (short-chain omega-amino acids)** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates effective bidentate coordination with minimal steric hindrance. Conversely, **similar amino acids with longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and steric hindrance reducing effective coordination. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating coordinating groups such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxy (-OH) groups at the para position** result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. These groups enhance interaction with the metal center through coordination. In contrast, **modifiers where the substituent at the para position is a non-coordinating group (e.g., methyl group)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. Electron-donating but non-coordinating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO₂) at the para position** result in **high yield**. An example is **4-nitrobenzoic acid**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. The nitrogen atoms increase electron density and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group and a thiol (-SH) group on a short aliphatic chain (three carbons or fewer)** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain may facilitate favorable interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, enhancing binding.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages, especially polyether chains extending from the carboxylic acid** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may disrupt optimal coordination with the catalyst by introducing flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with amide bonds linking functional groups or amino acids (containing amide linkages)** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing groups attached to the carboxylic acid, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The adjacent carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups along with a carboxylic acid group on an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst’s active sites.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with heteroaromatic substituents at the para position** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. The steric hindrance and electronic effects of the bulky heteroaromatic group may impede effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with phenolic groups attached to a propanoic acid chain (where the hydroxyphenyl group is not directly attached to the carboxyl group)** result in **low yield**. An example is **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**. The increased distance between the phenolic hydroxyl group and the carboxyl group may reduce the overall coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains (aromatic rings)** result in **low yield**. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine). The bulky side chain may cause steric hindrance, preventing optimal interaction with the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: In your rule definitions, use the keys from the `patterns` dictionary instead of the SMARTS strings themselves. For example, in Rule 1, change `'smarts': [patterns['carboxylic_acid'], patterns['primary_amine'], patterns['carboxylic_acid']]` to `'smarts': ['carboxylic_acid', 'primary_amine', 'carboxylic_acid']`. This ensures that when you reference `compiled_patterns[smarts]`, you're using the correct keys that exist in the `compiled_patterns` dictionary.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Similarly, in the `'exclude_smarts'` fields within your rules, make sure to use the keys from the `patterns` dictionary instead of SMARTS strings. For example, replace `'exclude_smarts': [patterns['long_aliphatic_chain']]` with `'exclude_smarts': ['long_aliphatic_chain']`.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Modify the code where you access `compiled_patterns`. In your loop, replace `pattern = compiled_patterns[smarts]` with `pattern = compiled_patterns[smarts_key]`, where `smarts_key` is the key from the `patterns` dictionary. This change works in conjunction with Suggestions 1 and 2 to ensure that you're consistently using keys to access compiled patterns.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Verify and update your SMARTS patterns to accurately represent the chemical functionalities described in the natural language rules. For instance, ensure that the pattern for `bulky_hydrophobic_side_chain` in Rule 15 correctly identifies amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains like aromatic rings (e.g., phenylalanine). Adjust patterns as needed for accurate matching.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: After making the above changes, test your code with known examples from the rules (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) to ensure that the feature matrix correctly reflects rule matches. This will help confirm that the transformation is now effective.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Implement additional error handling to catch exceptions during substructure matching. For example, wrap the matching code in try-except blocks and log any errors. This will make debugging easier and improve the robustness of your code.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

**1. Comparison with Previous Metrics:**

- **Train Confidence:**
  - **Previous Metrics:** Average of 0.6352 and 0.5396, resulting in an approximate average of **0.5874**.
  - **Current Iteration Metrics:**
    - Iteration 1: 0.6167
    - Iteration 2: 0.5930
    - Iteration 3: 0.6559
    - Iteration 4: 0.6832
    - Iteration 5: **0.8333** (Peak)
    - Iteration 6: 0.7167
    - Iteration 7: 0.6690
    - **Final Metric:** **0.5**
  - **Observation:** The train confidence initially increased, surpassing the previous average and peaking at **83.33%**. However, in the final iteration, it dropped to **50%**, which is below the previous average. This indicates a decline in the effectiveness of the rules in predicting high yield.

- **Train Lift:**
  - **Previous Metrics:** Average of 1.2048 and 1.0559, resulting in an approximate average of **1.1304**.
  - **Current Iteration Metrics:**
    - Iteration 1: 1.2463
    - Iteration 2: 1.1929

    - Iteration 4: 1.3624
    - Iteration 5: **1.6204** (Peak)
    - Iteration 6: 1.4388
    - Iteration 7: 1.3339
    - **Final Metric:** **1.0**
  - **Observation:** The train lift showed significant improvement initially, indicating that the rules were becoming increasingly effective compared to random chance. However, the final lift value of **1.0** suggests that the rules have no better predictive power than random guessing.

- **Train Support:**
  - **Previous Metrics:** Average of 0.1667 and 0.1845, resulting in an approximate average of **0.1756**.
  - **Current Iteration Metrics:**
    - Iteration 1: 0.0190
    - Iteration 2: 0.0182
    - Iteration 3: 0.0554
    - Iteration 4: 0.0648
    - Iteration 5: **0.1143** (Highest)
    - Iteration 6: 0.0248
    - Iteration 7: 0.0952
    - **Final Metric:** **0.0**
  - **Observation:** The train support remained consistently lower than the previous average, indicating that the rules applied to a smaller portion of the dataset. The final support of **0.0** means that the current rules do not cover any instances in the training data.

- **Train Leverage:**
  - **Previous Metrics:** Average of 0.0289 and -0.0041, resulting in an approximate average of **0.0124**.
  - **Current Iteration Metrics:**
    - Iteration 1: 0.0050
    - Iteration 2: 0.0062
    - Iteration 3: 0.0160
    - Iteration 4: 0.0152
    - Iteration 5: **0.0335** (Peak)
    - Iteration 6: 0.0115
    - Iteration 7: 0.0048
    - **Final Metric:** **0.0**
  - **Observation:** Initially, leverage values indicated that the rules were providing a positive association over chance. The final leverage of **0.0** indicates that the rules no longer provide any advantage over random chance.

**2. Determining Local Minimum and Sufficiency of Iterations:**

- The metrics peaked around Iteration 5 across confidence, lift, support, and leverage.
- Post Iteration 5, there is a noticeable decline in all metrics, culminating in zeros for support and leverage, and reductions in confidence and lift to their minimum possible values.
- **Local Maximum Achieved:** The peak at Iteration 5 suggests that the optimal performance was achieved at this point.
- **Local Minimum Reached:** The decline after Iteration 5 indicates that further iterations are not improving the model and, in fact, are diminishing its performance.
- **Iteration Sufficiency:** Given that additional iterations beyond the peak have not resulted in performance improvements, it is reasonable to conclude that enough iterations have been conducted.

**3. Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

- **Re-evaluate Rule Specificity:**
  - The drop to zero in support suggests that the rules have become too specific or restrictive.
  - **Action:** Broaden the conditions of the rules slightly to encompass more instances without significantly lowering confidence.

- **Focus on High-Impact Rules:**
  - Identify which rules contributed most positively to confidence and lift in earlier iterations (e.g., around Iteration 5).
  - **Action:** Prioritize these rules and discard or modify those with minimal impact or negative leverage.

- **Balance Between Confidence and Support:**
  - High confidence with low support indicates that while the rule is accurate when it applies, it doesn't apply often enough.
  - **Action:** Strive for a balance where rules have both acceptable confidence and sufficient support to be impactful.

- **Avoid Overfitting:**
  - The decline in metrics may be due to overfitting to specific instances in the training data.
  - **Action:** Simplify the rules to make them more generalizable. Use cross-validation to ensure that the rules perform well on unseen data.

- **Incorporate Domain Knowledge:**
  - Ensure that the rules are chemically and mechanistically sound.
  - **Action:** Consult with chemists or domain experts to validate the plausibility of the rules and adjust them based on expert feedback.

- **Analyze Failing Rules:**
  - Investigate rules that resulted in low yield or negative leverage.
  - **Action:** Determine if these rules can be revised or if they should be removed entirely.

- **Iterative Refinement:**
  - Instead of large changes between iterations, implement smaller, controlled adjustments to observe their direct impact on the metrics.
  - **Action:** Monitor the effect of each change and revert if metrics start to decline.

- **Consider Alternative Metrics:**
  - Since lift and confidence have limitations, consider additional metrics like the F1 score or area under the ROC curve for a more comprehensive evaluation.
  - **Action:** Use these metrics to gain further insights into the performance of the rules.

- **Expand Dataset if Possible:**
  - Low support might be due to a limited dataset.
  - **Action:** If feasible, include more data to provide the rules with a broader base from which to learn.

**4. Conclusion:**

- The current set of rules, as indicated by the final metrics, are not performing effectively.
- A peak in performance was observed at Iteration 5, suggesting that previous iterations were more successful.
- The significant drop in support and the leveling of lift to 1.0 demonstrate that the rules no longer provide predictive value.
- **Improvement Strategy:**
  - Revisit and possibly revert to the rules from Iteration 5.
  - Apply the recommendations above to enhance the quality and applicability of the rules.
  - Focus on creating rules that are both scientifically valid and statistically significant.

**Overall, a refined approach that balances statistical metrics with domain expertise is essential for improving the performance of the current rules.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
Traditional Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance:**

Based on the latest training results, the performance of the current rules appears to be suboptimal:

1. **Decreased Accuracy:**
   - The latest 5-fold validation accuracy is **0.4286**, which is significantly lower than both the reference validation accuracies (ranging from **0.68** to **0.76**) and previous iterations of this program (which reached up to **0.7714**).
   - This decline suggests that the current set of rules is not effectively capturing the underlying patterns required to accurately predict the modifier loading on the catalyst.

2. **Consistent Underprediction:**
   - The model is predominantly predicting **low loading** for most molecules, including those where the experimental value is high.
   - Examples where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high include:
     - **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
     - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**
     - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N**
     - **C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O**
     - **C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O**
     - **C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O**

3. **Ineffectiveness of Rule 15:**
   - The SHAP analysis shows that **Rule 15** has a SHAP value of **0.0** for high loading across all molecules.
   - This indicates that **Rule 15 is not contributing to the model's predictions** at all.
   - Since no other rules are mentioned in the SHAP analysis for this iteration, it suggests that the model may not be utilizing any of the rules effectively.

4. **Underfitting Evidence:**
   - The low accuracy and lack of rule contribution imply that the model is **underfitting**.
   - It fails to capture the complexity of the data and the relationships between the features (rules) and the target variable (modifier loading).

5. **Comparison with Previous Iterations:**
   - Earlier iterations showed higher accuracies and more meaningful SHAP values, indicating that rules were contributing to predictions.
   - The deterioration in performance suggests that recent changes to the rules or feature matrix may have negatively impacted the model.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Review and Refine Rule 15:**
   - **Issue:** Rule 15 currently states that "modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains (aromatic rings) result in low yield."
   - **Observation:** Despite this rule, the model predicts low loading for molecules where the experimental value is high, and Rule 15 does not contribute (SHAP value of 0.0).
   - **Action:** Reevaluate Rule 15 to ensure it is correctly capturing the intended chemical feature and is properly encoded in the feature matrix.
     - Consider if the definition is too narrow or too broad.
     - Verify that the rule correctly identifies relevant molecules in the dataset.

2. **Reassess the Rule Set:**
   - **Issue:** The lack of contributions from other rules suggests possible errors in how the rules are implemented.
   - **Action:**
     - **Validate Rule Implementation:** Ensure that all rules are correctly translated into features in the model.
     - **Check for Redundancies or Conflicts:** Rules may be overlapping or contradicting each other, leading to confusion in the model.
     - **Enhance Rule Definitions:** Clarify and possibly expand rules to capture more nuanced chemical properties influencing modifier loading.

3. **Improve Feature Engineering:**
   - **Issue:** The feature matrix may not be accurately representing the rules' effects.
   - **Action:**
     - **Audit Feature Generation:** Review the process of generating features from the rules to ensure correctness.
     - **Incorporate Additional Features:** Consider adding more chemical descriptors or interaction terms to capture complex relationships.

4. **Address Underfitting:**
   - **Issue:** The model's low accuracy indicates it is too simple to capture the data's complexity.
   - **Action:**
     - **Increase Model Complexity:** Use a more sophisticated model capable of capturing non-linear relationships, such as ensemble methods or neural networks.
     - **Ensure Sufficient Training Data:** Verify that the dataset is large and diverse enough to support a more complex model.

5. **Utilize SHAP Analysis Effectively:**
   - **Issue:** Current SHAP analysis provides limited insights due to zero values.
   - **Action:**
     - **Verify SHAP Implementation:** Ensure that SHAP values are correctly computed for all rules.
     - **Identify Contributing Rules:** Use SHAP analysis to find which rules, if any, are influencing predictions.
     - **Focus on Problematic Rules:** For molecules with incorrect predictions, identify rules with high absolute SHAP values and reevaluate them.

6. **Enhance Model Generalization:**
   - **Issue:** The model may be overfitting to certain patterns while missing others, or underfitting altogether.
   - **Action:**
     - **Cross-Validation:** Continue using cross-validation to assess model performance.
     - **Regularization Techniques:** Apply regularization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
     - **Data Augmentation:** If possible, expand the dataset with more examples to help the model learn diverse patterns.

7. **Collaborate with Domain Experts:**
   - **Issue:** Chemical domain knowledge is crucial for formulating effective rules.
   - **Action:**
     - **Expert Review:** Have chemists review the current rules for validity and completeness.
     - **Incorporate Expert Suggestions:** Adjust rules based on expert insights to better reflect the chemistry involved.

8. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - **Issue:** Model development is an iterative process.
   - **Action:**
     - **Make Incremental Changes:** Adjust one or a few rules at a time to isolate their impact.
     - **Monitor Performance:** After each change, re-evaluate the model's performance and SHAP values.
     - **Document Changes:** Keep detailed records of what adjustments are made for future reference.

9. **Consider External Factors:**
   - **Issue:** There may be additional factors influencing modifier loading not captured by current rules.
   - **Action:**
     - **Expand Rule Scope:** Include new rules that consider factors like steric hindrance, electronic effects, and solvent interactions.
     - **Data Analysis:** Perform exploratory data analysis to discover patterns or features not previously considered.

10. **Ensure Data Quality:**
    - **Issue:** Errors or inconsistencies in the dataset can adversely affect model training.
    - **Action:**
      - **Data Cleaning:** Verify that the data is accurate and free from errors.
      - **Consistency Checks:** Ensure that all molecules are correctly labeled with their experimental loading values.

**Conclusion:**

The current rules are not effectively predicting the modifier loading on the catalyst, as evidenced by the low validation accuracy and inadequate SHAP contributions. It is essential to revisit and refine the rules, improve feature representation, and enhance the model's complexity to better capture the underlying chemical relationships. Collaboration with domain experts and iterative testing will be crucial steps in improving the model's performance.

Project Manager Message:
**Summary of Discussions and Analysis**

Based on the recent metrics and analyses, several key observations have emerged regarding the performance of the current rules used to predict the modifier loading on the catalyst:

1. **Initial Improvement Followed by Decline**: The model's performance improved up to **Iteration 5**, evidenced by increases in **train confidence**, **lift**, **support**, and **leverage**. However, after this peak, there was a noticeable decline in these metrics in subsequent iterations.

2. **Decreased Accuracy**: The latest 5-fold validation accuracy dropped to **42.86%**, significantly lower than the earlier iterations where accuracies were as high as **77.14%**. This suggests that the current rules are not effectively capturing the patterns needed for accurate predictions.

3. **Zero Train Support in Final Iteration**: The train support in the final iteration was **0.0**, indicating that the rules did not apply to any instances in the training data. This suggests that the rules have become too restrictive or possibly incorrect.

4. **Ineffectiveness of Certain Rules**: The SHAP analysis revealed that some rules, particularly **Rule 15**, had a SHAP value of **0.0** across all molecules, indicating they did not contribute to the model's predictions.

5. **Consistent Underprediction**: The model predominantly predicted **low loading** for molecules that experimentally showed **high loading**, indicating a bias or misrepresentation in the rules.

6. **Potential Implementation Issues**: Suggestions were made to modify the code implementation, such as using keys from the `patterns` dictionary instead of SMARTS strings directly, to ensure correct pattern matching and rule application.

**Directions and Suggestions to Optimize Current Rules**

To address these issues and improve the current rules, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Review and Correct Rule Implementation**:
   - **Use Consistent Keys**: Ensure that in the rule definitions, the keys from the `patterns` dictionary are used instead of the SMARTS strings themselves. This applies to both `'smarts'` and `'exclude_smarts'` fields.
   - **Access Compiled Patterns Correctly**: Modify the code where `compiled_patterns` is accessed to use the keys properly, ensuring the patterns are correctly applied.

2. **Reevaluate Rule Specificity and Applicability**:
   - **Broaden Overly Restrictive Rules**: Rules that are too specific may result in low support. Adjust these rules to be more inclusive without sacrificing accuracy.
   - **Simplify Overcomplicated Rules**: Complex rules may not generalize well. Simplify them to focus on the most impactful chemical features.

3. **Focus on High-Impact Rules from Peak Performance Iteration**:
   - **Revisit Iteration 5 Rules**: Since the model's performance peaked at Iteration 5, analyze and prioritize the rules from this iteration.
   - **Retain Effective Rules**: Identify rules that contributed positively (high confidence and lift) and ensure they are correctly implemented.

4. **Refine or Remove Ineffective Rules**:
   - **Assess Rules with Zero Contribution**: Rules like **Rule 15** that do not contribute to predictions should be examined for correctness and relevance.
   - **Adjust or Eliminate Problematic Rules**: Modify these rules to better capture important features or remove them if they do not add value.

5. **Enhance Chemical Pattern Definitions**:
   - **Verify SMARTS Patterns**: Ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately represent the chemical functionalities described in the rules.
   - **Update Patterns for Accuracy**: For example, adjust the pattern for `bulky_hydrophobic_side_chain` to correctly identify amino acids with aromatic rings.

6. **Implement Additional Error Handling**:
   - **Catch Matching Exceptions**: Add try-except blocks around substructure matching code to handle exceptions and prevent crashes.
   - **Log Errors for Debugging**: Record any errors encountered during pattern matching to facilitate troubleshooting.

7. **Balance Between Confidence and Support**:
   - **Aim for Generalizable Rules**: Strive for rules that have both reasonable confidence and sufficient support to impact predictions.
   - **Avoid Overfitting**: Ensure that rules are not tailored too closely to the training data at the expense of generalization.

8. **Collaborate with Domain Experts**:
   - **Validate Rules Chemically**: Work with chemists to confirm that the rules make sense from a chemical perspective.
   - **Incorporate Expert Insights**: Adjust rules based on expert feedback to improve their relevance and effectiveness.

9. **Iterative Testing and Validation**:
   - **Make Incremental Changes**: Modify one rule at a time and assess the impact on model performance.
   - **Use Cross-Validation**: Continue using cross-validation to evaluate the model's generalizability and prevent overfitting.

10. **Consider Additional Features or Rules**:
    - **Incorporate New Chemical Descriptors**: Add features that capture other relevant chemical properties influencing modifier loading.
    - **Adjust Existing Rules**: Refine rules to better capture the nuances of chemical interactions with the catalyst.

**Possibility for Further Optimization without Overfitting**

There is **significant potential** for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Evidence of Underfitting**: The model's poor performance and lack of rule contribution indicate underfitting rather than overfitting.

- **Opportunity to Improve Rule Implementation**: Correcting the rule definitions and their implementation can enhance model performance.

- **Potential to Rebalance Rules**: Adjusting the specificity and coverage of the rules can improve their applicability and impact.

- **Room for Model Enhancement**: Incorporating additional chemical knowledge and refining features can lead to better generalization.

**Conclusion**

Given the above analysis and the identified areas for improvement, it is clear that the current rules can be further optimized to enhance the model's predictive performance without risking overfitting.

**Please Optimize Rules**

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with an additional carboxylic acid group (amino dicarboxylic acids)** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites, enhancing binding to the metal center of the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a primary amino group located on a short aliphatic chain of five carbons or fewer (short-chain omega-amino acids)** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates effective bidentate coordination with minimal steric hindrance. Conversely, **similar amino acids with longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and steric hindrance reducing effective coordination. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating coordinating groups such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxy (-OH) groups at the para position** result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. These groups enhance interaction with the metal center through coordination. In contrast, **modifiers where the substituent at the para position is a non-coordinating group (e.g., methyl group)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. Electron-donating but non-coordinating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO₂) at the para position** result in **high yield**. An example is **4-nitrobenzoic acid**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. The nitrogen atoms increase electron density and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group and a thiol (-SH) group on a short aliphatic chain (three carbons or fewer)** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain may facilitate favorable interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, enhancing binding.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages, especially polyether chains extending from the carboxylic acid** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may disrupt optimal coordination with the catalyst by introducing flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with amide bonds linking functional groups or amino acids (containing amide linkages)** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing groups attached to the carboxylic acid, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The adjacent carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups along with a carboxylic acid group on an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst’s active sites.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with heteroaromatic substituents at the para position** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. The steric hindrance and electronic effects of the bulky heteroaromatic group may impede effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with phenolic groups attached to a propanoic acid chain (where the hydroxyphenyl group is not directly attached to the carboxyl group)** result in **low yield**. An example is **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**. The increased distance between the phenolic hydroxyl group and the carboxyl group may reduce the overall coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains (aromatic rings)** result in **low yield**. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine). The bulky side chain may cause steric hindrance, preventing optimal interaction with the catalyst.
