- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear in specifying that modifiers containing an aldehyde (−CHO) group attached to a benzene ring are associated with low yield. The property insight is solid, as aldehyde groups are electron-withdrawing and can deactivate aromatic rings, potentially hindering the reaction. The rule combines functional groups, adding complexity. It is well-supported by at least two data points (_4-formylbenzoic acid_ and _5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid_), ensuring adequate coverage. The balance between specificity and data support strengthens the rule.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** clearly states that modifiers containing an indole ring are associated with high yield. There is property insight since indole rings are electron-rich and may enhance catalyst interaction. The rule focuses on a specific heteroaromatic structure, contributing to complexity. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (_(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid_), which weakens its overall reliability. Additional supporting examples would improve the rule.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear in identifying modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains as leading to low yield. The property insight is strong, considering the highly electron-withdrawing nature of fluorinated groups, which can reduce reactivity. The rule adds complexity by focusing on a specific substructure. With at least two supporting data points (_2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid_ and _4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid_), coverage is satisfactory, and the balance is well-maintained.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** provides clear guidance that modifiers containing a nitro group (−NO₂) on a benzene ring are associated with high yield. However, this contradicts typical chemical understanding, as nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups that usually decrease reactivity. The property insight is lacking or counterintuitive. Coverage is limited to one data point (_4-nitrobenzoic acid_), reducing the rule's credibility. Additional data and a clearer rationale are needed.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** clearly describes modifiers where a pyridine ring is connected via an alkyl chain to a carboxylic acid group, associating them with high yield. There is some property insight, considering that pyridine can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalysis. The rule's complexity is appropriate, but coverage is limited to one data point (_4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid_). More examples are necessary to validate the rule.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** specifies that modifiers containing a sulfanyl (−SH) group attached to an aliphatic chain result in high yield. The property insight is reasonable, as thiol groups can act as ligands or participate in redox chemistry. The rule combines functional groups, adding complexity. Coverage is limited to one data point (_3-sulfanylpropanoic acid_), which reduces confidence in the rule. Additional data would enhance its validity.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear in stating that modifiers with a sulfanyl (−SH) group attached directly to a benzene ring lead to low yield. The property insight recognizes that aromatic thiols may behave differently from aliphatic thiols, potentially due to resonance effects. The rule is adequately complex but is supported by only one data point (_4-sulfanylbenzoic acid_). Broader coverage is needed for robustness.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly associates modifiers based on aromatic amino acids without additional functional groups with low yield. The property insight suggests that lack of functional diversity may limit catalytic interaction. The rule is specific but only has one supporting data point (_(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid_). Increased coverage would strengthen the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear and provides good property insight by linking amino acids with aliphatic side chains to high yield, possibly due to favorable interactions with the catalyst. The rule's complexity is balanced, focusing on a class of compounds. It is well-supported by at least two data points (_(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid_ and _(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid_), ensuring solid coverage and enhancing its reliability.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** explicitly states that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (−OH) groups on an aliphatic chain are associated with high yield. The property insight is logical, as multiple hydroxyl groups can facilitate strong interactions with the catalyst. The rule has appropriate complexity. However, coverage is limited to one data point (_(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid_), necessitating additional data for confirmation.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear in associating modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups on aliphatic chains with low yield. The property insight is reasonable, as carbonyl groups may interfere with catalyst function. The rule has moderate complexity but is supported by only one data point (_4-oxoheptanedioic acid_). Broader coverage is required to validate the rule.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** clearly indicates that modifiers where a pyridine ring is directly attached to a benzene ring result in low yield. The property insight suggests potential steric or electronic hindrance due to ring fusion. The rule is complex, but coverage is limited to one data point (_4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid_), reducing its dependability.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** clearly states that modifiers containing bulky ether chains are associated with low yield. The property insight considers steric hindrance affecting catalyst access. While the rule has complexity, coverage is limited to one data point (_2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid_), requiring more data to strengthen its claims.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** specifies that modifiers with methoxy (−OCH₃) groups on a benzene ring attached via an alkyl chain to a carboxylic acid yield high results. The property insight is sound, as methoxy groups are electron-donating and may enhance reactivity. The rule is complex but is supported by only one data point (_4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid_), indicating a need for more examples to confirm its validity.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is clear in stating that modifiers containing an amino group (−NH₂) on a pentanoic acid chain are associated with high yield. The property insight is reasonable, considering amino groups can coordinate with metals. The rule's complexity is adequate, but coverage is limited to a single data point (_5-aminopentanoic acid_), necessitating additional data for support.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and unambiguous, supported by two data points. The presence of an aldehyde group attached directly to a benzene ring correlates with low yield, offering good property insight into the electron-withdrawing effects affecting the reaction. The rule balances specificity and coverage well.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clearly defined but supported by only one data point. While the nitro group's strong electron-withdrawing nature may enhance the yield, the low coverage limits the rule's reliability. Additional data points are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and supported by two data points. It provides property insight into how perfluoroalkyl chains, due to their electron-withdrawing effects and steric hindrance, lead to low yield. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and supported by three data points, offering good coverage. The combination of amino acids with short aliphatic side chains correlating with high yield provides valuable property insight. The rule's complexity, involving both functional groups and chain length, is well-balanced.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and supported by two data points. It complements Rule 4 by highlighting that longer aliphatic side chains in amino acids are associated with low yield, suggesting steric effects negatively impact the reaction. The rule offers good property insight with reasonable coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear but supported by only one data point. While the presence of an indole ring may enhance yield due to its aromatic structure, the low coverage limits confidence in the rule's validity. Additional examples are necessary to confirm this relationship.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clearly stated but based on a single data point. The sulfanyl group's potential to promote high yield through metal coordination offers property insight, but the lack of additional supporting data points restricts the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear with one supporting data point. It contrasts with Rule 7, suggesting that the position of the sulfanyl group affects yield. However, the limited coverage diminishes the strength of this conclusion.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and specifies that modifiers with an aldehyde group directly attached to an aromatic ring lead to low yield. The rule is supported by at least two data points (_4-formylbenzoic acid_ and _5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid_) showing low yield. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight by highlighting the electron-withdrawing effect of the aldehyde group on aromatic rings, which may hinder the reaction. The rule involves a combination of sub-structures, meeting the complexity criterion.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in stating that modifiers with an amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring result in high yield. The rule offers property insight as amino groups are electron-donating, potentially enhancing the reaction. It has appropriate complexity by specifying both the functional group and its position. However, coverage is limited, with only one data point (_4-aminobenzoic acid_) supporting the rule, which weakens its statistical significance.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly distinguishes the effect of sulfanyl group position on yield, providing good clarity. It offers property insight by indicating that the position of the –SH group (aliphatic vs. aromatic) influences reactivity. The rule shows complexity by considering both the functional group and its attachment. However, the coverage is limited, with only one data point supporting each case (_3-sulfanylpropanoic acid_ for high yield and _4-sulfanylbenzoic acid_ for low yield), making the rule less robust.

It is supported by data points (4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), providing acceptable coverage given the specificity.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear about identifying modifiers with aromatic rings substituted with electron-donating groups leading to low yield. The property insight that EDGs decrease acid strength, thus reducing coordination ability, is appropriate. The rule effectively combines substructures and is supported by several data points (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid), achieving good coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in its definition, specifying modifiers with a formyl group directly attached to an aromatic ring associated with low yield. The property insight provides a reasonable explanation that the aldehyde group could interfere with coordination or cause side reactions. The rule is supported by data points (4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), achieving acceptable coverage for its specificity.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly differentiates between thiol groups on short aliphatic chains (leading to high yield) and thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings (leading to low yield). The property insight is plausible, explaining the different outcomes based on the thiol group's position. The rule effectively considers combinations of substructures. It is supported by data points (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid for high yield, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid for low yield), providing acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in defining modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain associated with high yield. The property insight is logical, considering enhanced coordination via chelation. However, the rule may lack robustness due to limited coverage, as only one data point (D-gluconic acid) supports it. Additional data would strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly identifies modifiers with bulky ether chains or long polyether segments as associated with low yield. The property insight is appropriate, attributing reduced effectiveness to steric hindrance and flexibility of ether chains. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is supported by data points (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), providing adequate coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 distinguishes between heterocycles connected via short aliphatic linkers (high yield) and those connected directly to the carboxylic acid (low yield). The property insight is sound, explaining how linkers allow better interaction with the catalyst. The rule effectively combines multiple substructures and is supported by data points (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid and L-tryptophan for high yield, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid for low yield), providing good coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly identifies modifiers with strongly fluorinated alkyl chains as associated with low yield. The property insight is reasonable, noting that fluorine's electronegativity can destabilize metal interactions. While the rule is specific, it is supported by data points (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid), providing acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 defines medium-chain saturated carboxylic acids without additional functional groups as high yield. The property insight is plausible, suggesting that the optimal chain length facilitates favorable interactions. However, the rule may need additional data points to strengthen its coverage, as it is currently supported by a single example (octanoic acid).

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 identifies modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional heterocyclic rings or carbonyl groups as high yield. The property insight is reasonable, suggesting multiple coordination sites or enhanced interactions. The rule is complex, considering several structural features, and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), providing good coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 identifies modifiers with amide linkages between the carboxylic acid and additional functional groups as low yield. The property insight is rational, explaining that amide bonds can reduce coordination ability and introduce steric hindrance. The rule effectively considers specific structural features and is supported by data points (e.g., 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid), providing acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 defines modifiers with ketone groups within aliphatic chains attached to aromatic rings leading to high yield if the overall structure allows effective interaction. While the property insight is plausible, suggesting additional binding sites for coordination, the rule may lack robustness due to only one supporting data point (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid). Additional examples would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 identifies modifiers with hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains as associated with low yield. The property insight is logical, noting that the distance of the hydroxyl group from the carboxylic acid reduces coordination ability. However, with limited data points (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), the rule may benefit from further supporting evidence to enhance its validity.

The property insight is adequate, explaining how aldehyde groups may inhibit catalyst function. The rule combines multiple structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two data points (rows 19 and 20) associated with low yield, meeting the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clearly defined, enabling easy identification of modifiers containing polyether chains. The rule provides sufficient property insight, explaining how flexibility from ether linkages may disrupt the catalyst's structure. It considers combinations of functional groups (multiple ether linkages), meeting the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by at least two data points (rows 11 and 32) with low yield, ensuring adequate coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clearly specified, making it easy to identify long-chain aliphatic acids with terminal polar groups. The property insight is adequate, explaining how terminal polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or create unfavorable interactions. The rule combines multiple structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least three data points (rows 29, 31, and 34) associated with low yield, meeting the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clearly articulated, allowing easy identification of modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to the carboxyl group. The property insight is sufficient, discussing how resonance stabilization in amide groups affects ligand effectiveness. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two data points (rows 23 and 26) with low yield, meeting the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear in its description of amino acids with non-coordinating aromatic side chains. The property insight is adequate, emphasizing the lack of additional coordination sites and potential steric hindrance. However, the rule is supported by only one data point with low yield (row 13), while a similar compound (row 15) shows high yield, contradicting the prediction. This suggests coverage is insufficient and the rule may not accurately predict outcomes in all cases. The rule may need refinement or additional data to improve its reliability.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clearly defined, making it straightforward to identify modifiers with electron-withdrawing perfluorinated alkyl chains. The property insight is sufficient, explaining the effect of fluorine atoms on coordination. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (row 14) with low yield, which does not meet the coverage criterion. Additional data points are needed to confirm the validity of this rule.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly defines modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-hydroxy substituents. The property insight is acceptable, discussing potential deactivation due to hydroxy groups. However, in the dataset, one matching modifier (row 30) shows low yield, supporting the rule, but another (row 7) shows high yield, contradicting it. This inconsistency suggests the rule may not reliably predict yield outcomes, and coverage is limited or conflicting. The rule may need revision or further data to improve its accuracy.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clearly stated, enabling identification of modifiers with sulfur-containing thiol groups near the carboxyl group. The property insight is satisfactory, explaining the role of metal-sulfur bonds in enhancing catalyst stability. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (row 18) with high yield, which does not meet the required coverage criterion. More data points are needed to substantiate this rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 suggests that modifiers with heterocyclic rings directly attached to the carboxyl group may have high yield if the heterocycle can coordinate effectively, but the yield depends on specific attributes. While the rule provides property insight about the importance of nitrogen position and electron density, it lacks clarity in terms of a definitive prediction, making it difficult to assign high or low yield to modifiers based on this rule alone. The rule is supported by both a positive example (row 16) and a negative example (row 12), but the ambiguity reduces its utility. The complexity is acceptable, but the coverage is limited. Refinement for clarity is recommended.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clearly defined, allowing identification of modifiers with extended conjugation between the carboxyl group and a distal heterocycle. The property insight is adequate, explaining the effect of electron delocalization on coordination effectiveness. The rule considers the combination of structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two data points (rows 12 and 24) demonstrating the predicted effect on yield, meeting the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.
