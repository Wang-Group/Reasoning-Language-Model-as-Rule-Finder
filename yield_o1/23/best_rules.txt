**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing an amino group (–NH₂) on an aromatic ring or on a short aliphatic chain (five or fewer carbons)** are associated with **high yield**. This is likely due to the amino group enhancing coordination with the metal center and the optimal chain length facilitating effective interaction.
  - *High yield examples*: _4-aminobenzoic acid_, _5-aminopentanoic acid_, _(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid_, _(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid_

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing an amino group (–NH₂) on an aliphatic chain longer than five carbons** are associated with **low yield**. The extended chain length may introduce steric hindrance or reduce the modifier’s ability to coordinate effectively.
  - *Low yield examples*: _7-aminoheptanoic acid_, _8-aminooctanoic acid_, _(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid_

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with **aromatic rings substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** such as **nitro (–NO₂)** or **bromoalkyl groups** are associated with **high yield**. EWGs can enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid and improve coordination with metal sites.
  - *High yield examples*: _4-nitrobenzoic acid_, _4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid_

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with **aromatic rings substituted with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** like **methyl (–CH₃)**, **methoxy (–OCH₃)**, or **phenolic hydroxyl groups (–OH)** are associated with **low yield**. EDGs can reduce the acidity of the carboxylic acid, hindering effective coordination.
  - *Low yield examples*: _4-methylbenzoic acid_, _3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid_, _2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid_

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing an **aldehyde group (–CHO) attached directly to an aromatic ring** are associated with **low yield**. The aldehyde may engage in side reactions or interfere with catalyst coordination.
  - *Low yield examples*: _4-formylbenzoic acid_, _5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid_

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a **sulfhydryl group (–SH) on a short aliphatic chain (three carbons or fewer)** are associated with **high yield**, possibly due to the thiol group enhancing metal coordination. However, when the sulfhydryl group is **attached directly to an aromatic ring**, they are associated with **low yield**, potentially due to steric hindrance or electronic effects.
  - *High yield example*: _3-sulfanylpropanoic acid_
  - *Low yield example*: _4-sulfanylbenzoic acid_

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups (three or more) on an aliphatic chain** are associated with **high yield**. The multiple hydroxyl groups can facilitate better interaction and stabilization with the catalyst.
  - *High yield example*: _(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid_

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **bulky ether chains with few or no hydroxyl groups** are associated with **low yield**. The bulky ethers may impede effective interaction with the catalyst due to steric hindrance.
  - *Low yield examples*: _2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid_, _3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid_

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic aromatic rings connected to a carboxylic acid group via a short aliphatic linker** are associated with **high yield**. The linker allows for optimal positioning of the heterocycle for coordination. In contrast, those connected **directly to the carboxylic acid group** are associated with **low yield**, possibly due to rigidity hindering effective interaction.
  - *High yield examples*: _4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid_, _(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid_
  - *Low yield example*: _4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid_

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **fluorinated alkyl chains attached to a carboxylic acid group** are associated with **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine may destabilize interactions with the catalyst.
  - *Low yield examples*: _2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid_, _4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid_

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing a **phenolic hydroxyl group (–OH) connected to an aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain longer than four carbons** are associated with **high yield**. The longer chain may reduce steric hindrance and enhance coordination. Those with **shorter chains (three carbons or fewer)** are associated with **low yield** due to potential steric or electronic interference.
  - *High yield example*: _5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid_
  - *Low yield examples*: _3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid_, _2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid_

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl or heterocyclic structures** are associated with **high yield**. The additional functional groups may enhance binding affinity to the metal center.
  - *High yield examples*: _1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid_, _2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid_, _1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid_

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain saturated carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (e.g., eight carbons)** are associated with **high yield**. The optimal chain length may facilitate appropriate hydrophobic interactions without causing steric hindrance.
  - *High yield example*: _octanoic acid_

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **bulky acyl groups or acylated amino acids** are associated with **low yield**. The bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, preventing effective coordination.
  - *Low yield examples*: _4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid_, _(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid_

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **ketone groups within aliphatic chains** or at **terminal positions** are associated with **low yield**. The presence of ketone groups may interfere with the catalyst or lead to side reactions.
  - *Low yield example*: _4-oxoheptanedioic acid_
