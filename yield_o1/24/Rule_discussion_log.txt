Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for a straightforward determination of high yield when a modifier is an aromatic carboxylic acid substituted at the para position with electron-withdrawing or metal-coordinating groups. The underlying physical-chemical properties are adequately explained, highlighting increased acidity and enhanced metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring with specific substituents), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by multiple data points (Compounds 1, 4, 7, 21, 24) that all result in high yield, ensuring strong coverage. The balance between specificity and coverage is effectively achieved.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in specifying that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids lead to high yield due to metal coordination by heteroatoms. The physical-chemical insight is adequate. The rule involves combinations of sub-structures, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by several data points (Compounds 8, 16, 17, 22) with high yields. However, Compound 12 (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) results in low yield, contradicting the rule. This suggests the rule may not fully account for structural variations where the heteroaromatic ring is attached to another aromatic system. The rule could be refined to address such exceptions, improving its clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 effectively distinguishes between amino acids with aliphatic side chains (leading to high yield) and those with non-coordinating aromatic side chains (leading to low yield). The underlying physical-chemical properties are well-explained, emphasizing chelation and steric effects. The rule combines functional groups and side chain characteristics, satisfying the complexity requirement. It is supported by multiple data points for both high yield (Compounds 0, 2, 3, 15) and low yield (Compounds 13, 33), providing strong coverage. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly differentiates between aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal thiol groups (high yield) and aromatic thiol carboxylic acids (low yield). The physical-chemical rationale is sound, explaining differences in metal coordination. However, the rule is only supported by one data point for each case (Compounds 18 and 10), which is below the minimum coverage criterion. To strengthen the rule, additional supporting data points are needed. Currently, the rule lacks sufficient coverage to be considered robust.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and specifies that modifiers with multiple ether linkages result in low yield due to steric hindrance and altered environments. The physical-chemical insight is adequate. The rule considers combinations of functional groups (polyether chains), satisfying complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (Compounds 11 and 32) that result in low yield, meeting the coverage criterion. There are no contradictory data points, and the rule strikes a good balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield, supported by explanations of potential side reactions. The rule involves specific functional group arrangements, fulfilling the complexity requirement. It is backed by two data points (Compounds 19 and 20) showing low yield, satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule is well-balanced and adequately supported by the data.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 specifies that modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups lead to low yield, with reasonable physical-chemical explanations regarding their electronic and hydrophobic nature. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (Compound 14), which is insufficient for robust coverage. Additional examples are necessary to strengthen the rule's validity. Currently, the rule lacks sufficient evidence to be fully supported.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear in indicating that modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups lead to low yield, due to electronic and steric factors. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by two data points (Compounds 23 and 26) resulting in low yield, satisfying the coverage requirement. The rule maintains a good balance between specificity and generality.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly identifies that modifiers with remote functional groups on long aliphatic chains lead to low yield, with adequate explanations regarding ineffective catalyst interaction and steric effects. The rule involves combinations of chain length and functional group positioning, satisfying complexity. It is supported by three data points (Compounds 29, 31, 34) showing low yield, meeting the coverage criterion. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 specifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield, supported by physical-chemical insights on enhanced interactions and stability. The rule combines chain length and functional group multiplicity, satisfying complexity. It is supported by two data points (Compounds 6 and 9) resulting in high yield, fulfilling the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance between specificity and applicability.

- **Rule 6**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Atoms Adjacent to Carboxyl Group Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group at the 3-position relative to the nitrogen atom in the ring.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The nitrogen atom in the heteroaromatic ring provides an additional coordination site, and its proximity to the carboxyl group facilitates the formation of chelate complexes with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Perfluorinated Carboxylic Acids Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains, where all hydrogens in the alkyl chain are replaced with fluorine atoms.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, reducing the solubility of the modifier in the reaction medium and diminishing interactions with the catalyst. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can decrease the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

Polyether chains can introduce flexibility and entropic factors that reduce binding affinity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Long hydrophobic chains can enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, while the terminal carboxyl group remains available for metal coordination. The lack of additional functional groups prevents interference with catalyst binding.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield; amino group may form internal hydrogen bonds or coordinate differently)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield; hydroxyl group may engage in competing interactions)

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole rings) capable of coordinating with metal centers.

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing sulfhydryl (**–SH**) groups on short aliphatic chains along with carboxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal coordination due to the lone pair on sulfur. Short chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing effective interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield; aromatic ring may introduce steric hindrance or reduce sulfur availability)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids Substituted with Heterocyclic Rings Lead to Variable Yield Based on Coordination Ability**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with heterocyclic rings; the yield depends on the presence of donor atoms in the heterocycle capable of effective metal coordination.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Heterocycles with available lone pairs (e.g., pyrazole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction. Heterocycles lacking such features may not contribute to coordination and can introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**; pyridine nitrogen may be less available due to steric factors or electron delocalization)

  - **Prediction**:
    - **Modifiers with coordinating heterocycles** will result in **high yield**.
    - **Modifiers without effective coordination** will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Conjugated Ketone Groups in Aromatic Systems Lead to High Yield**

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is well-defined, combining the presence of primary amino and carboxylic acid groups on short aliphatic chains (fewer than six carbons) to predict high yield. The rule is clear, provides solid physico-chemical insight about coordination enhancing interaction with the catalyst, considers multiple substructures, and is supported by multiple examples (Compounds 0, 2, 3) and counterexamples (Compounds 31, 34), meeting the criteria of clarity, property insight, complexity, coverage, and balance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 has inconsistencies between its description and examples, affecting clarity and property insight. The rule states that para-substituted electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids lead to high yield. However, it includes **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound 21) as an example, which contains a nitro group—an electron-withdrawing group—not electron-donating. This contradiction undermines the rule's clarity and suggests that additional factors may influence yield, indicating the need for refinement of the rule.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and provides strong physico-chemical insight by focusing on heterocyclic aromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms, which enhance metal coordination. It considers combinations of substructures (heteroaromatic rings with carboxyl groups) and is supported by multiple examples (Compounds 8, 16, 22) and a counterexample (Compound 12), satisfying the criteria of clarity, property insight, complexity, coverage, and balance.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 effectively combines multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids to predict high yield, providing clear physico-chemical reasoning about chelation and increased solubility. While the rule is clear and considers complex substructures, it is supported by only two data points (Compounds 6, 9). Although it meets the minimum coverage criterion, the limited number of examples may affect the rule's robustness and general applicability.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 has limited coverage, with only one supporting example (Compound 18) and one counterexample (Compound 10). While the rule is clear and offers physico-chemical insight about sulfhydryl groups enhancing metal coordination, the minimal data support and narrow focus reduce its reliability. The rule may not be widely applicable without additional supporting data.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and provides adequate physico-chemical insight by explaining how aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids can deactivate catalysts. It considers combinations of functional groups and is supported by multiple examples (Compounds 19, 20), fulfilling the criteria of clarity, property insight, complexity, coverage, and balance.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 lacks sufficient coverage, relying on a single example (Compound 14) to predict that perfluorinated alkyl chains lead to low yield. Although the physico-chemical reasoning is sound, the minimal data support limits the rule's validity and applicability. Additional examples are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is well-defined and supported by multiple examples (Compounds 11, 32) showing that ether linkages in aliphatic chains lead to low yield. The rule provides clear physico-chemical insight about entropic penalties and reduced metal coordination, and considers specific structural features, meeting the criteria of clarity, property insight, complexity, coverage, and balance.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 effectively combines the presence of amide groups adjacent to carboxylic acids to predict low yield, offering physico-chemical reasoning about resonance effects reducing coordination ability. It is supported by multiple examples (Compounds 23, 26, 33) and meets all the criteria, making it a robust and reliable rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10, while clear, has limited coverage and insufficient data support, relying primarily on one positive example (Compound 5) and counterexamples (Compounds 29, 31). The physico-chemical insight provided is minimal, and the rule may oversimplify the effects of long aliphatic chains without considering other contributing factors. This limits the rule's reliability and suggests a need for further investigation and refinement.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is narrowly focused, with limited coverage supported by only one example (Compound 15) and one counterexample (Compound 13). While it provides plausible physico-chemical insight about donor heteroatoms in aromatic side chains enhancing coordination, the minimal data support reduces confidence in the rule's general applicability. Additional examples are needed to validate and strengthen this rule.
