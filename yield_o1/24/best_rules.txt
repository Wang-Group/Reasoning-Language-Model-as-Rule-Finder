- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids with Free Amino and Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with straight aliphatic chains of up to five carbons, containing free amino groups (**–NH₂**) and carboxylic acid groups (**–COOH**), and lacking bulky or aromatic side chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups facilitates coordination with metal centers. The small aliphatic chain minimizes steric hindrance, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group, strengthening coordination with metal centers and improving catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**, High Yield)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**, High Yield)

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing polyether chains terminated with ether linkages (**–O–R**) rather than hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Terminal ether groups reduce the ability to coordinate with metal centers due to lack of hydrogen bonding. Polyether chains increase steric hindrance and flexibility, disrupting optimal interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**, Low Yield)

  - **Description**: Modifiers where the alkyl chain is extensively fluorinated, replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine, resulting in perfluoroalkyl chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluorinated chains increase hydrophobicity and decrease polarizability, reducing solubility and interaction with the catalyst and reaction medium. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may destabilize the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 9**: **Amino Acids with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains Lacking Donor Heteroatoms Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains that lack heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., phenylalanine with a phenyl side chain).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Bulky aromatic side chains increase steric hindrance without providing coordination benefits, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol groups (**–SH**) at the terminal position, away from aromatic rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups are strong ligands due to sulfur's soft Lewis base character, enhancing coordination with metal centers.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Directly Attached to the Ring Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain trifluoroacetyl (**–COCF₃**) groups within their structure.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Trifluoroacetyl groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which may destabilize metal coordination complexes or interfere with catalyst function due to their highly electronegative nature.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Compound **28**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.
