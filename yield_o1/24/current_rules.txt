**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers Containing Both Amino and Carboxylic Acid Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains (2 to 5 Carbons) Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that feature both an amino group (**–NH₂**) and at least one carboxyl group (**–COOH**) on a straight-chain aliphatic backbone consisting of 2 to 5 carbon atoms.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The presence of amino and carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing the formation of stable complexes with the catalyst. Short chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating effective interaction with the metal center.

- **Examples**:

**End of Rules**

---

These rules provide a structured approach to predict whether a molecular modifier will lead to a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By focusing on combinations of sub-structures and functional groups, and considering the underlying physico-chemical properties, the rules help in selecting appropriate modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.

**Coverage and Balance**:

- **Broad Coverage**: The rules encompass modifiers with amino acids, aromatic compounds, aliphatic chains, heterocycles, and various functional groups.

- **Simplicity and Complexity**: The set includes simple rules with broad coverage (e.g., Rule 1 on amino and carboxylic acids on short chains) and more complex rules with narrower focus (e.g., Rule 12 on aromatic systems capable of chelation).

- **Predictive Power**: Each rule provides clear criteria for predicting high or low yield, aiding in decision-making for catalyst modification.

By applying these rules, chemists can make informed choices in the design and selection of molecular modifiers to enhance the yield of the target reaction, contributing to the success of the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------
