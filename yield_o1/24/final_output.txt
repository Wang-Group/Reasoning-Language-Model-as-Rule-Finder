    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Aliphatic Amino Acids with Both Amino and Carboxylic Acid Groups Result in High Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic (non-aromatic) amino acids containing both amino (–NH₂) and carboxylic acid (–COOH) functional groups. The carbon chain length typically ranges from 3 to 6 carbons.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.
  - **Examples**:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-glutamic acid)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups at the Para Position Lead to High Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (–NO₂), amino (–NH₂), or bromomethyl (–CH₂Br) at the para (4-) position relative to the carboxyl group.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group and can facilitate stronger interactions with the metal centers, improving catalytic activity.
  - **Examples**:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

- **Rule 3**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids Lead to High Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing heteroaromatic rings such as pyridine, pyrazole, or benzofuran rings.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers through heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen), enhancing catalyst stability and electron transfer processes.
  - **Examples**:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

- **Rule 4**: **Simple Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups beyond the carboxyl group.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The simplicity of the molecule minimizes steric hindrance and allows efficient packing and coordination with the catalyst surface.
  - **Examples**:
    - Octanoic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Result in High Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol (–SH) groups at the terminal position of the carbon chain.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalyst binding and electron transfer.
  - **Examples**:
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Bulky Electron-Donating Groups on Aromatic Rings Can Lead to High Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers with bulky, electron-donating groups such as methoxy (–OCH₃) groups on aromatic rings may enhance yield by affecting electronic interactions with the catalyst.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, which can facilitate better coordination with metal centers and improve catalytic processes.
  - **Examples**:
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

- **Rule 7**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Remote Amino or Hydroxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths longer than six carbons and have amino (–NH₂) or hydroxyl (–OH) groups located away from the carboxyl group (e.g., at the omega position).
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Remote functional groups may not effectively interact with the catalyst, and longer chains can introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - **Examples**:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers Containing Aldehyde Groups on Aromatic Rings Lead to Low Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers that have an aldehyde (–CHO) functional group attached directly to the aromatic ring, particularly at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or deactivate catalysts by forming adducts, reducing the overall yield.
  - **Examples**:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Multiple Ether Linkages Result in Low Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers containing polyether chains with multiple ether (–O–) linkages, resembling oligoethylene glycols.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether linkages can increase flexibility and steric bulk, hindering effective catalyst interaction and possibly causing catalyst deactivation.
  - **Examples**:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 10**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Lead to Low Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing thiol (–SH) groups attached to the aromatic ring.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups on aromatic rings may strongly bind to metal centers, potentially leading to catalyst poisoning or deactivation.
  - **Examples**:
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 11**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Influence Yield Based on Side Chain Structure**
  - **Description**:
    - **Phenyl Side Chains**: Amino acids with phenyl (benzene ring) side chains tend to result in **low yield**.
    - **Heteroaromatic Side Chains**: Amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains (containing heteroatoms like nitrogen) tend to result in **high yield**.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Phenyl side chains may not interact favorably with the catalyst, whereas heteroaromatic side chains can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.
  - **Examples**:
    - Low Yield: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (L-phenylalanine)
    - High Yield: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-tryptophan)
  - **Prediction**: Yield is influenced by the nature of the aromatic side chain.

- **Rule 12**: **Hydroxyphenylalkanoic Acids Influence Yield Based on Chain Length**
  - **Description**: Modifiers where a hydroxyphenyl group is connected via an aliphatic chain; the length of the chain affects the yield.
    - **Short Chains (3 Carbons)**: Tend to result in **low yield**.
    - **Longer Chains (5 Carbons)**: Tend to result in **high yield**.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Longer aliphatic chains may reduce steric hindrance and allow better interaction between functional groups and the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - Low Yield: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
    - High Yield: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - **Prediction**: Yield increases with longer aliphatic chains separating the hydroxyphenyl group from the carboxyl group.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide (–CONH–) linkages near the carboxylic acid group, especially when the amide connects the carboxyl group to an aromatic ring.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide bonds can alter the electronic properties of the carboxyl group and may interfere with catalyst binding and reactivity.
  - **Examples**:
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers Containing Perfluoroalkyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups, where the alkyl chain is fully fluorinated, are highly electron-withdrawing and can affect catalyst interactions.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluoroalkyl groups increase electron deficiency and may hinder effective coordination with the catalyst due to strong electron-withdrawing effects.
  - **Examples**:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers Containing Ketone Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Influence Yield Based on Substituents**
  - **Description**: Modifiers where a ketone (–C=O) group is adjacent to the carboxyl group can affect yield based on the overall structure.
    - **Simple Diketone Acids**: May result in **low yield** due to potential chelation that deactivates the catalyst.
    - **Ketone Acids with Bulky Electron-Donating Substituents**: May result in **high yield** by enhancing interactions with the catalyst.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-donating groups can balance the electron-withdrawing effects of the ketone, improving catalyst interaction.
  - **Examples**:
    - Low Yield: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
    - High Yield: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
  - **Prediction**: Yield is influenced by the molecular context of the ketone group.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing or Coordinating Groups at the Para Position Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para (4-) position with electron-withdrawing groups or groups capable of coordinating to metal ions. These groups include nitro (–NO₂), amino (–NH₂), bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), and hydroxyl (–OH).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to interact with metal centers. Coordinating groups such as amino and hydroxyl groups can form additional bonds with metal ions, stabilizing the catalyst and improving its reactivity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing heteroaromatic rings, such as pyridine, pyrazole, benzofuran, or pyridinone rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) in the aromatic ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and facilitating electron transfer processes. This coordination improves the overall reactivity of the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

  - **Exception**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**) results in **low yield**, possibly due to steric hindrance or deactivating effects from the pyridyl group at the para position.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will generally result in **high yield**, with noted exceptions.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Amino Acids with Amino and Carboxylic Acid Groups Result in High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids containing both an amino group (–NH₂) and one or more carboxylic acid groups (–COOH), particularly those with short aliphatic side chains (3 to 5 carbons).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups allows for chelation with metal centers in the catalyst. This dual coordination enhances catalyst stability and reactivity by providing multiple binding sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

  - **Exception**:
    - Amino acids with aromatic side chains like **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**) result in **low yield** due to potential steric hindrance or lack of effective coordination.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**, except for those with specific aromatic side chains.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of up to eight carbons and no additional functional groups beyond the terminal carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The simplicity and linearity of these molecules minimize steric hindrance, allowing efficient packing and interaction with the catalyst surface. This can enhance the catalyst's ability to facilitate the reaction.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Terminal Thiol Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing a thiol (–SH) group at the terminal (ω) position of the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups can form strong coordinate bonds with metal centers due to the lone pair electrons on sulfur. This strong interaction can enhance catalyst binding and electron transfer, improving catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Remote Functional Groups (Amino or Hydroxyl) on Long Aliphatic Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths longer than six carbons and contain amino (–NH₂) or hydroxyl (–OH) groups located away from the carboxyl group (e.g., at the ω-position).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Functional groups remote from the carboxyl group may not effectively interact with the catalyst's active sites. Additionally, longer carbon chains can introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Multiple Ether Linkages Result in Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing polyether chains with multiple ether (–O–) linkages, such as oligoethylene glycol chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and steric bulk, which can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. They may also block active sites or alter the local environment unfavorably.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Attached to Aromatic Rings Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the aromatic ring, particularly at positions that are ortho or para to the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can undergo side reactions, such as forming Schiff bases with amino groups. This may deactivate the catalyst or divert the reactants, reducing the overall yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing thiol (–SH) groups attached directly to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic thiol groups can strongly bind to metal centers in a manner that may poison or deactivate the catalyst. This strong, irreversible binding can block active sites necessary for catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Influence Yield Based on Side Chain Structure**

  - **Description**:
    - **Aromatic Side Chains Without Coordinating Heteroatoms**: Amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine) result in **low yield**.
    - **Aromatic Side Chains with Coordinating Heteroatoms**: Amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains that can coordinate with metals (e.g., tryptophan) result in **high yield**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic side chains without coordinating sites may introduce steric hindrance or do not contribute to catalyst interaction. In contrast, heteroaromatic side chains with nitrogen atoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Prediction**: Yield is influenced by the presence of coordinating heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers Containing Perfluoroalkyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have perfluorinated alkyl chains, where all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and can significantly reduce the electron density of the carboxyl group. This can impair the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst, leading to reduced yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide (–CONH–) linkages near the carboxylic acid group, especially when the amide connects the carboxyl group to an aromatic ring or another functional group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide bonds can alter the electronic properties of nearby functional groups and may hinder effective coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst. They can also introduce rigidity or steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Compound **23**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Ketone Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Influence Yield Based on Additional Substituents**

  - **Description**:
    - **Simple Ketone Acids**: Modifiers with ketone (–C=O) groups adjacent to carboxyl groups without additional electron-donating substituents result in **low yield**.
    - **Ketone Acids with Electron-Donating Groups**: Modifiers where the ketone group is adjacent to electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy-substituted aromatics) can result in **high yield**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ketone groups can interact with the catalyst, potentially inhibiting activity. However, electron-donating substituents can counteract this effect by enhancing electron density and facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Compound **27**)
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**)

  - **Prediction**: Yield is influenced by the presence of electron-donating groups near the ketone.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Short Aliphatic Chains Connecting Hydroxyphenyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where a hydroxyphenyl group is connected to the carboxyl group via a short aliphatic chain (e.g., three carbons).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Short aliphatic chains may not provide sufficient flexibility or optimal spacing for effective interaction with the catalyst. Steric hindrance between the hydroxyphenyl group and the catalyst can reduce yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Compound **30**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Highly Hydroxylated Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and provide additional sites for hydrogen bonding or coordination with the catalyst. This can increase the modifier's interaction with the catalyst surface, enhancing reactivity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids with Amino and Carboxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with short aliphatic side chains (up to five carbons) containing both amino groups (–NH₂) and carboxylic acid groups (–COOH), without aromatic rings or bulky substituents.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. The short aliphatic chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating access to active sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Strong Electron-Withdrawing Groups at the Para Position (Excluding Aldehydes) Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para (4-) position with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (–NO₂), amino (–NH₂), or bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), but not aldehyde groups (–CHO).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, promoting higher yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**)

  - **Exception**:
    - Modifiers with aldehyde groups at the para position, such as **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**), will result in **low yield**.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Heterocycles Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings, such as pyridine, pyrazole, or pyridone rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen heteroatoms in the aromatic ring can coordinate with metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and facilitating electron transfer. This interaction boosts catalytic efficiency and leads to higher yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Polar Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbon atoms and no additional polar functional groups beyond the terminal carboxylic acid.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The simple structure minimizes steric hindrance and allows effective interaction with the catalyst's active sites. The hydrophobic chain can enhance substrate-catalyst interactions in non-polar environments.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Terminal Polar Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are long-chain (six or more carbons) aliphatic carboxylic acids containing additional polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) at the terminal end of the chain opposite the carboxylic acid.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The terminal polar groups can introduce steric hindrance and disrupt effective coordination with the catalyst. They may also increase the flexibility of the molecule, reducing the precision of interactions with active sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers Containing Multiple Ether Linkages (Polyethers) Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have polyether chains with multiple ether (–O–) linkages within the molecule.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of multiple ether linkages increases molecular flexibility and size, which can cause steric hindrance. Ether oxygen atoms may also interact unfavorably with the catalyst, disrupting coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Lacking Coordinating Heteroatoms Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains that do not contain heteroatoms capable of coordination, such as phenylalanine.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms may introduce steric hindrance without providing benefits of additional coordination. This can hinder effective catalyst-modifier interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Coordinating Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination, such as the indole ring in tryptophan.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. This additional coordination can lead to improved yields.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol (–SH) groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups are strong ligands for metal ions due to the high polarizability of sulfur atoms. They enhance coordination with the catalyst's metal centers without introducing significant steric hindrance.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Attached Directly to the Ring Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly connected to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings may bind too strongly to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst or causing aggregation. This can reduce the efficiency of the reaction.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups (Polyols) Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can serve as additional coordination sites for the catalyst, enhancing interaction and stability. They also increase the solubility of the modifier, improving reaction efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers Containing Perfluoroalkyl Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains where hydrogen atoms are fully substituted with fluorine atoms.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. They may also destabilize the catalyst-modifier complex due to unfavorable electronic interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Ketone Groups Adjacent to Aromatic Rings Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone (–C=O) groups connected to the aromatic ring, possibly with additional methoxy substituents.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ketone groups adjacent to aromatic systems can participate in coordination with metal centers. Methoxy groups may enhance electron delocalization, facilitating interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain amide (–CONH–) linkages near the carboxylic acid group, especially when connected to aromatic rings or additional functional groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide bonds can alter the electronic properties of adjacent carboxyl groups, reducing their ability to coordinate with metal centers. The rigidity of the amide linkage may also introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Aromatic Rings Connected via Long Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with aromatic rings attached through aliphatic chains of four or more carbons. The aromatic ring may contain additional substituents like hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Longer aliphatic chains reduce steric hindrance from the aromatic ring, allowing effective interaction with the catalyst. The aromatic ring may also facilitate electron delocalization, enhancing reactivity.

  - **Example**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Compound **24**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids with Both Amino and Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with straight aliphatic chains of up to five carbons, containing both free amino groups (**–NH₂**) and carboxylic acid groups (**–COOH**), and lacking bulky or aromatic side chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and activity. The small aliphatic chain minimizes steric hindrance, allowing efficient interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups at the Para Position (Excluding Aldehydes) Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para (4-) position with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (**–NO₂**), amino (**–NH₂**), halogens (**–Br**), or halomethyl groups (**–CH₂Br**), excluding aldehyde groups (**–CHO**).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, promoting higher yields. Aldehyde groups, however, may interfere with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**, High Yield)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**, High Yield)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids Containing Nitrogen Heterocycles Lead to High Yield**

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**, High Yield)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**, High Yield)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**, High Yield)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Compound **24**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbons and no additional functional groups such as hydroxyl or amino groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The hydrophobic long chain may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate. The absence of additional functional groups reduces steric hindrance and potential interference with catalyst activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups (Polyols) Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with several hydroxyl (**–OH**) groups along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups offer additional coordination sites and increase hydrophilicity, enhancing solubility and interaction with the catalyst. This can improve catalyst stability and reactivity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**, High Yield)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where the alkyl chain is fully or extensively fluorinated (perfluoroalkyl chains), replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluorinated groups are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can hinder effective interactions with the catalyst and reduce solubility in the reaction medium. They may also destabilize the catalyst through electronic effects.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: This modifier will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Aldehyde Groups at the Para Position Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with an aldehyde group (**–CHO**) positioned para to the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or interact unfavorably with the catalyst, potentially deactivating it or reducing its efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers Containing Polyether Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have polyether chains with multiple ether linkages (**–O–**) within the molecule, such as polyethylene glycol derivatives.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Polyether chains increase flexibility and steric bulk, potentially disrupting optimal coordination with the catalyst. Ether oxygens may also weakly coordinate with metal centers, interfering with catalyst activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**, Low Yield)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Amino Acids with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains Lacking Coordinating Heteroatoms Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains without heteroatoms capable of coordination, such as phenyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Bulky aromatic side chains can introduce steric hindrance without providing additional coordination sites, reducing catalyst-modifier interactions and catalytic efficiency.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: This modifier will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Coordinating Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in an indole ring) capable of coordinating with metal centers.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: This modifier will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Terminal Thiol Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol (**–SH**) groups along the carbon chain, not directly attached to aromatic rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups are strong ligands due to the polarizability of sulfur, enhancing coordination with metal centers without causing significant steric hindrance.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: This modifier will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Attached Directly to the Ring Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly connected to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups attached to aromatic systems may bind too strongly to metal centers or create steric hindrance, potentially deactivating the catalyst or causing aggregation.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: This modifier will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Amide Linkages Near Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain amide bonds (**–CONH–**) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group, especially when connected to aromatic systems or additional functional groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide linkages can alter the electronic properties of the carboxyl group and reduce its ability to coordinate effectively with metal centers. The rigidity introduced by the amide bond may also hinder optimal catalyst interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**, Low Yield)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Ketone Substituents Adjacent to the Ring Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups (**–C=O**) adjacent to the aromatic ring, forming conjugated systems.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Conjugated ketone groups can participate in resonance and coordinate with metal centers, enhancing electron delocalization and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**, High Yield)
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers Containing Trifluoroacetyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain trifluoroacetyl (**–COCF₃**) groups within their structure.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Trifluoroacetyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing, which can interfere with catalyst coordination or reactivity. They may destabilize the catalyst or reduce its efficiency.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Compound **28**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: This modifier will result in **low yield**.

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbons and without additional functional groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The hydrophobic long chain may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate. The absence of polar functional groups minimizes potential interference with catalyst coordination sites.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing multiple hydroxyl (**–OH**) groups on adjacent carbons (polyols).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase hydrophilicity and provide additional coordination sites for metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**, High Yield)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Terminal Ether Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing polyether chains terminated with ether linkages (**–O–R**) rather than hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Terminal ether groups reduce the ability to coordinate with metal centers due to lack of hydrogen bonding. Polyether chains increase steric hindrance and flexibility, disrupting optimal interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**, Low Yield)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where the alkyl chain is extensively fluorinated, replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine, resulting in perfluoroalkyl chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluorinated chains increase hydrophobicity and decrease polarizability, reducing solubility and interaction with the catalyst and reaction medium. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may destabilize the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Aldehyde Substituents at the Para Position Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with aldehyde groups (**–CHO**).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups may react with amines or other nucleophiles, leading to side reactions that deactivate the catalyst or consume reactants, thus reducing yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Amino Acids with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains Lacking Donor Heteroatoms Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains that lack heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., phenylalanine with a phenyl side chain).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Bulky aromatic side chains increase steric hindrance without providing coordination benefits, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., nitrogen in an indole ring).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms in aromatic rings provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol groups (**–SH**) at the terminal position, away from aromatic rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups are strong ligands due to sulfur's soft Lewis base character, enhancing coordination with metal centers.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Directly Attached to the Ring Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly attached to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings may bind irreversibly to metal centers, potentially poisoning the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers Containing Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain amide linkages (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group, especially when the amide is connected to aromatic rings or additional carbonyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups can compete with carboxyl groups for metal coordination, altering electronic properties and reducing catalyst binding efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**, Low Yield)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Conjugated Ketone Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups conjugated with the aromatic ring system.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Conjugated ketone groups may participate in resonance with the aromatic system, enhancing electron delocalization and providing additional coordination sites for metal binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**, High Yield)
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Trifluoroacetyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain trifluoroacetyl (**–COCF₃**) groups within their structure.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Trifluoroacetyl groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which may destabilize metal coordination complexes or interfere with catalyst function due to their highly electronegative nature.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Compound **28**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids with Free Amino and Carboxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with straight aliphatic chains of up to five carbons, containing both free amino groups (**–NH₂**) and carboxylic acid groups (**–COOH**), and lacking bulky or aromatic side chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for binding to metal centers, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. The small aliphatic chain minimizes steric hindrance, allowing effective access to the active sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Strong Electron-Withdrawing Groups at the Para Position Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (**–NO₂**), bromo (**–Br**), or amino (**–NH₂**) groups, excluding aldehyde (**–CHO**) and thiol (**–SH**) groups directly attached to the ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**, High Yield)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**, High Yield)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Atoms Near the Carboxyl Group Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings where the nitrogen atom is adjacent to or near the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The nitrogen atom provides additional lone pairs for coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. This facilitates stronger binding to the catalyst's metal centers, improving the catalyst's performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**, High Yield)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**, High Yield)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**, Low Yield) – The carboxyl group is attached to a benzene ring, and the pyridine ring is connected via a carbon-carbon bond, reducing effective coordination.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbons and no additional functional groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The long hydrophobic chain may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate. The carboxyl group remains available for effective coordination with the metal center.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing multiple hydroxyl (**–OH**) groups, especially when the hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons (polyols).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate to metal centers, enhancing binding interactions. The increased hydrophilicity can improve solubility and dispersion of the catalyst in the reaction medium.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**, High Yield)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol groups (**–SH**) at the terminal position, away from aromatic rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups are strong nucleophiles and can form stable metal-thiolate bonds. This enhances the modifier's ability to coordinate with the metal center of the catalyst, improving its performance.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Terminal Ether Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing polyether chains terminated with ether linkages (**–O–R**), particularly when lacking terminal hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms have lower electron-donating ability compared to hydroxyl groups and lack hydrogen bonding capability. The presence of flexible ether chains can introduce steric hindrance and decrease effective interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**, Low Yield)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where the alkyl chain is extensively fluorinated, replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine to form perfluoroalkyl chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorine's high electronegativity and low polarizability result in reduced interactions with the catalyst. Perfluorinated chains increase hydrophobicity and can lead to poor solubility in the reaction medium.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Aldehyde Substituents Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with aldehyde groups (**–CHO**) directly attached to the ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form unwanted side products or complexes with the catalyst, deactivating it. They can also compete with the carboxyl group for coordination sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Amino Acids with Bulky Non-Coordinating Aromatic Side Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., phenylalanine with a phenyl group).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Bulky aromatic side chains increase steric hindrance around the coordination site without providing additional binding interactions. This can hinder the modifier's ability to effectively interact with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in an indole ring) capable of additional coordination.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of heteroatoms in the side chain increases the number of coordination sites. This enhances binding to the catalyst and improves its stability and activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide linkages (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group, especially when the amide is connected to aromatic rings or additional carbonyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups can decrease the electron density of the adjacent carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Amide bonds may also introduce rigidity, affecting the overall conformation and binding efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**, Low Yield)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Conjugated Ketone Groups in Aromatic Systems Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups conjugated within the aromatic ring system, enhancing electron delocalization.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Conjugated systems can stabilize negative charge during coordination. The ketone group can also participate in metal binding through its oxygen atom, providing additional coordination sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**, High Yield)
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Trifluoroacetyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain trifluoroacetyl (**–COCF₃**) groups within their structure, introducing strong electron-withdrawing effects.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Trifluoroacetyl groups can significantly withdraw electron density from the molecule, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. This can weaken interactions with the catalyst and lower its effectiveness.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Compound **28**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Hydroxylated Aromatic Rings Connected by Aliphatic Chains Lead to Variable Yield Based on Chain Length**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have hydroxylated aromatic rings attached via aliphatic chains; the length of the aliphatic chain influences the yield.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Longer aliphatic chains can reduce steric hindrance and allow for better coordination, while shorter chains may not sufficiently separate the aromatic ring from the coordination site, causing steric interference.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Compound **30**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers with longer aliphatic chains will result in **high yield**, whereas those with shorter chains will result in **low yield**.

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain both a free primary amino group (**–NH₂**) and at least one carboxyl group (**–COOH**), especially when the molecule is an amino acid with aliphatic or heteroaromatic side chains containing donor heteroatoms.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Donor heteroatoms in the side chain (e.g., nitrogen in an indole ring) can further enhance coordination, increasing catalyst stability and activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield; lacks side-chain donor heteroatoms)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituted Electron-Donating Amino Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with amino groups (**–NH₂**).

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amino groups are strong electron donors that increase electron density on the aromatic ring and can participate in coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction and stabilizing active species.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituted Halogen Atoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with halogen atoms such as bromine (**–Br**).

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Halogen substituents can affect the electronic properties of the aromatic ring and may enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group, improving coordination with the metal catalyst. The halogen can also engage in secondary interactions that stabilize the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups (**–CHO**) attached directly to the aromatic ring, particularly at positions ortho or para to the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are susceptible to oxidation and can interact unfavorably with the catalyst, potentially deactivating it or leading to side reactions. They may also interfere with metal coordination due to competing binding sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers Containing Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups (**–OH**) in vicinal (adjacent) positions, either in aliphatic chains or aromatic systems.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups can chelate metal centers, forming stable complexes that enhance catalyst performance. This chelation increases binding affinity and can protect the metal center from deactivation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Atoms Adjacent to Carboxyl Group Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group at the 3-position relative to the nitrogen atom in the ring.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The nitrogen atom in the heteroaromatic ring provides an additional coordination site, and its proximity to the carboxyl group facilitates the formation of chelate complexes with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Perfluorinated Carboxylic Acids Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains, where all hydrogens in the alkyl chain are replaced with fluorine atoms.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, reducing the solubility of the modifier in the reaction medium and diminishing interactions with the catalyst. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can decrease the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Terminal Ether Groups or Polyether Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing ether linkages (**–O–**) at terminal positions or along the carbon chain, especially polyether chains without terminal hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms have lone pairs that are less available for coordination due to their position within the molecule, and they may not effectively interact with metal centers. Polyether chains can introduce flexibility and entropic factors that reduce binding affinity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with carbon chains of six or more carbons and no additional functional groups like amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Long hydrophobic chains can enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, while the terminal carboxyl group remains available for metal coordination. The lack of additional functional groups prevents interference with catalyst binding.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield; amino group may form internal hydrogen bonds or coordinate differently)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield; hydroxyl group may engage in competing interactions)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide linkages (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group, particularly when the amide is connected to an aromatic ring or involved in conjugation.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups can delocalize electron density through resonance, reducing the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen for coordination. This delocalization can decrease the binding affinity to metal centers.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Amino Acids with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains Lacking Donor Heteroatoms Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains without heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., phenyl groups).

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Bulky side chains can cause steric hindrance, impeding access to the metal center. The absence of donor heteroatoms means fewer coordination sites, reducing interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole rings) capable of coordinating with metal centers.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms in the side chain provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and potentially stabilizing catalytic intermediates.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Sulfhydryl Groups in Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing sulfhydryl (**–SH**) groups on short aliphatic chains along with carboxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal coordination due to the lone pair on sulfur. Short chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing effective interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield; aromatic ring may introduce steric hindrance or reduce sulfur availability)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids Substituted with Heterocyclic Rings Lead to Variable Yield Based on Coordination Ability**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with heterocyclic rings; the yield depends on the presence of donor atoms in the heterocycle capable of effective metal coordination.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Heterocycles with available lone pairs (e.g., pyrazole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction. Heterocycles lacking such features may not contribute to coordination and can introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**; pyridine nitrogen may be less available due to steric factors or electron delocalization)

  - **Prediction**:
    - **Modifiers with coordinating heterocycles** will result in **high yield**.
    - **Modifiers without effective coordination** will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Conjugated Ketone Groups in Aromatic Systems Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups conjugated within the aromatic system, enhancing electron delocalization.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Conjugated ketone groups can participate in resonance structures, increasing the electron density on coordinating atoms and providing additional sites for metal interaction, which can stabilize the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully formulated to reflect the relationships between molecular structures of modifiers and their impact on the reaction yield. The rules combine multiple functional groups and sub-structures to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different features influence catalyst performance. Each rule is grounded in physico-chemical principles, considering electronic effects, coordination chemistry, and steric factors.

- **Coverage**: The rules address a broad spectrum of functional groups present in the dataset, ensuring applicability to various modifiers.

- **Chemical Rationale**: Each rule is supported by underlying chemical principles that explain the observed effects on yield.

- **Predictive Power**: By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural features.

- **Balance**: The rules maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity, with some rules offering broader coverage and others addressing specific cases with detailed features.

These refined rules improve upon the initial set by providing clearer guidelines, eliminating less effective rules, and focusing on the most significant structural factors influencing the reaction outcome. They serve as valuable tools for guiding future experiments and optimizing reaction conditions in the context of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid and Primary Amino Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain both a primary amino group (**–NH₂**) and at least one carboxyl group (**–COOH**) on short aliphatic chains (typically fewer than six carbons).

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The presence of amino and carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Short aliphatic chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing better access to the metal centers.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield; longer chain may introduce unfavorable flexibility)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**, Low Yield; extended chain length may reduce effective coordination)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**, particularly when the aliphatic chain is of moderate length (fewer than six carbons).

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituted Electron-Donating Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups such as amino (**–NH₂**) or hydroxy (**–OH**) groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring and the carboxylate group, enhancing coordination with metal centers. They may also stabilize catalytic intermediates through resonance effects.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**; despite being an electron-withdrawing group, nitro can engage in coordination)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield; aldehyde group is electron-withdrawing and may deactivate catalysts)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Compound **30**, Low Yield; shorter aliphatic chain may affect coordination)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with Heterocyclic Aromatic Carboxylic Acids Containing Nitrogen Atoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms, such as pyridine or pyrazole rings.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, enhancing binding with metal centers. The aromatic system maintains rigidity and planarity, promoting effective orbital overlap.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**, Low Yield; steric hindrance or electronic factors may impede coordination)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have multiple hydroxyl (**–OH**) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group, forming polyol structures either in aliphatic chains or cyclic forms.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal centers, enhancing binding affinity and stability of the catalyst complex. They also increase solubility in polar solvents, improving interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers Containing Sulfhydryl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that possess a sulfhydryl group (**–SH**) on a short aliphatic chain in addition to a carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal coordination due to the lone pair on sulfur. Short chains allow for effective interaction without significant steric hindrance.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Counterexample**:

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have aldehyde groups (**–CHO**) directly attached to the aromatic ring or adjacent to the carboxylic acid group.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are highly reactive and can form undesired side reactions or irreversibly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst and reducing yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where the alkyl chain is extensively fluorinated, replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative and lipophobic, reducing interactions with both the catalyst and the solvent. Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect diminishes the coordinating ability of functional groups.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain internal ether linkages (**–O–**) within their aliphatic chains, particularly polyether structures.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms are less available for coordination due to their positioning within flexible chains. This flexibility can decrease binding affinity to metal centers due to entropic penalties.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Amide Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide bonds (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group or within the main chain.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups can engage in resonance, reducing the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for metal coordination. This can decrease the interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Compound **23**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Long Aliphatic Chains Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of six or more carbons and no additional functional groups like amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate. The terminal carboxyl group remains available for metal coordination without interference from other groups.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield; hydroxyl group may lead to unwanted side interactions)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield; amino group may interfere with proper coordination)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Amino acid modifiers with aromatic side chains that include heteroatoms capable of coordinating with metal centers, such as the indole nitrogen in tryptophan.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Donor heteroatoms in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and potentially stabilizing reactive intermediates.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield; lacks a coordinating heteroatom in the side chain)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed to illustrate the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their effects on the reaction yield. They combine multiple substructures and functional groups to provide comprehensive guidelines:

- **Coverage**: The rules encompass a wide range of structural features present in the dataset, including various functional groups, ring systems, and chain lengths.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Each rule is grounded in chemical principles, such as coordination chemistry, electronic effects, steric factors, and solubility, explaining why certain features lead to high or low yields.

- **Balance**: The set includes both broad rules with wide applicability and more specific rules that address particular structural features, striking a balance between simplicity and complexity.

By applying these rules, predictions can be made regarding the effectiveness of potential modifiers based on their molecular structures. This can guide the selection and design of modifiers to optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde and ketone groups are electron-withdrawing and can interfere with metal coordination, deactivating the catalyst and reducing yield.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Compound **27**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing amide groups (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group or within the main chain of the molecule.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide bonds can delocalize lone pair electrons through resonance, reducing the availability of nitrogen and oxygen atoms for metal coordination. This weakens interactions with the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Compound **23**)

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Flexible Ether Chains Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that contain internal ether linkages (**–O–**) within flexible aliphatic chains, such as polyethers.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms are less effective for coordination due to their position within flexible chains. Increased molecular flexibility can reduce effective binding to metal centers because of entropic penalties.

- **Example**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Sulfhydryl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that contain a sulfhydryl group (**–SH**) on a short aliphatic chain, along with a carboxyl group.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal coordination due to the polarizability of sulfur's lone pair electrons. Short chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing effective interaction with metal centers.

- **Example**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield; the aromatic ring may delocalize sulfur's lone pair electrons, reducing coordination ability)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers That Are Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Amino acids with aromatic side chains that include heteroatoms capable of coordinating with metal centers, such as the indole nitrogen in tryptophan.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Donor heteroatoms in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and stabilizing reactive intermediates.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield; lacks coordinating heteroatoms in the side chain)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Unique Aromatic Systems Capable of Chelation Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing aromatic systems with adjacent carbonyl groups capable of chelating metal centers, such as benzofuran-1,3-dione derivatives.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can act as bidentate ligands, enhancing coordination with metal centers and stabilizing the catalyst complex.

- **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Halomethyl Groups on Aromatic Rings Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with a halomethyl group (**–CH₂X**, where **X** is a halogen like bromine) at the para position.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The halomethyl group may affect electron distribution in a way that facilitates metal coordination or participate in secondary interactions, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Example**:
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups on Aromatic Rings Lead to Low Yield, Except for Nitro Groups at the Para Position**

- **Description**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., aldehyde, formyl, fluorine) on aromatic rings generally reduce yield. However, modifiers with nitro groups (**–NO₂**) at the para position can result in high yield due to specific electronic effects.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, hindering metal coordination. The nitro group's resonance structures may enhance specific interactions with metal centers despite its electron-withdrawing nature.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)
  - **High Yield**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups generally result in **low yield**, but para-nitrobenzoic acid is an exception and results in **high yield**.

These rules provide a comprehensive framework to predict whether a molecular modifier will lead to a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By analyzing combinations of functional groups and structural features, the rules consider underlying physico-chemical properties such as:

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups like amino, hydroxy, and heterocyclic nitrogen enhance metal coordination.
- **Steric Factors**: Short aliphatic chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating effective interaction with the catalyst.
- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density, while electron-withdrawing groups decrease it, affecting metal coordination.
- **Chelation**: Multiple binding sites (e.g., adjacent hydroxyl or carbonyl groups) can chelate metal ions, stabilizing the catalyst complex.
- **Hydrophobicity and Solubility**: Chain length and polar groups influence solubility and interaction with the catalyst.

**Coverage and Balance**:

- **Broad Coverage**: The rules encompass a wide range of functional groups and structural motifs present in the dataset, including amino acids, aromatic compounds, aliphatic acids, heterocycles, and various substituents.
- **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**: The set includes simple rules with high coverage (e.g., modifiers with amino and carboxylic groups on short chains) and more complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., modifiers with unique aromatic systems capable of chelation).
- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule provides clear criteria for predicting high or low yield, aiding in the selection and design of effective modifiers.

By applying these rules, chemists can make informed decisions in selecting molecular modifiers to optimize the yield of the target reaction, advancing the goals of the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------

- **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and no other functional groups besides the terminal carboxyl group.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: These modifiers may improve interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or facilitate better substrate accessibility.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

- **Counterexamples**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**; Low Yield—additional hydroxyl group alters properties)
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**; Low Yield—additional amino group may introduce undesired interactions)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers featuring electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., aldehyde, keto, fluorinated groups) adjacent to the carboxyl group or on the aromatic ring.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density at coordination sites, weakening interaction with metal centers.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers Containing Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers with amide linkages (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group or within the main chain.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups may delocalize electron density through resonance, reducing the availability of the nitrogen or oxygen atoms for effective metal coordination.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Flexible Polyether Chains Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing internal ether linkages (**–O–**) within flexible aliphatic chains, such as polyethylene glycol derivatives.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Increased flexibility can reduce effective coordination due to entropic effects, and ether oxygens may not coordinate strongly with metal centers.

- **Example**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Nitrogen-Containing Aromatic Side Chains Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Amino acids with aromatic side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles capable of metal coordination.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen in heterocycles offers coordination sites, enhancing catalyst interaction.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**; Low Yield—no coordinating nitrogen in side chain)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Ketone Groups on Aliphatic Chains Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers having carbonyl groups (**–C=O**) such as aldehydes or ketones on aliphatic chains adjacent to carboxyl groups.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Carbonyl groups can engage in competing interactions and may sequester metal ions through undesired coordination, reducing catalyst activity.

- **Example**:
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Compound **27**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Aromatic Systems Capable of Chelation Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing aromatic systems with adjacent donor groups (e.g., hydroxyl and carbonyl) capable of chelating metal centers.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Chelation enhances the stability of metal complexes and improves catalytic efficiency.

- **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Bulky Substituents Near Coordination Sites Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that have large, bulky groups near potential coordination sites, which can hinder effective interaction with the metal center due to steric hindrance.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Steric hindrance prevents optimal alignment and binding of the modifier to the catalyst, reducing catalytic activity.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules provide a structured approach to predict whether a molecular modifier will lead to a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By focusing on combinations of sub-structures and functional groups, and considering the underlying physico-chemical properties, the rules help in selecting appropriate modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.

**Coverage and Balance**:

- **Broad Coverage**: The rules encompass modifiers with amino acids, aromatic compounds, aliphatic chains, heterocycles, and various functional groups.

- **Simplicity and Complexity**: The set includes simple rules with broad coverage (e.g., Rule 1 on amino and carboxylic acids on short chains) and more complex rules with narrower focus (e.g., Rule 12 on aromatic systems capable of chelation).

- **Predictive Power**: Each rule provides clear criteria for predicting high or low yield, aiding in decision-making for catalyst modification.

By applying these rules, chemists can make informed choices in the design and selection of molecular modifiers to enhance the yield of the target reaction, contributing to the success of the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------
