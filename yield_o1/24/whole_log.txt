Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Functional Group Descriptions into SMARTS Patterns**

  - *Explanation*: Rewriting the rules using SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns will allow for precise identification of functional groups and substructures directly from SMILES strings. This makes it easier to automate the extraction of features and generate a numeric feature matrix.
  
  - *Example*: Instead of "Modifiers containing thiol (–SH) groups," use SMARTS pattern `[SH]` to identify thiol groups in modifiers.

- **Advice 2**: **Quantify Structural Features with Numerical Descriptors**

  - *Explanation*: Replace qualitative terms like "short-chain" or "long-chain" with numerical descriptors such as the exact number of carbons in the chain. This quantification facilitates the creation of numeric feature matrices.
  
  - *Example*: Define chain length as an integer variable `Chain_Length`, where modifiers with `Chain_Length ≤ 5` lead to high yield, and `Chain_Length > 5` lead to low yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Utilize Molecular Descriptors Calculable from SMILES**

  - *Explanation*: Incorporate easily computable molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and aromatic ring count. These descriptors can be computed programmatically and included in the feature matrix.
  
  - *Example*: Create a rule where modifiers with `TPSA > 60 Å²` result in low yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Standardize Position and Substituent Nomenclature**

  - *Explanation*: Use IUPAC numbering and standardized nomenclature for positions on aromatic rings and chains to eliminate ambiguity. This standardization allows for consistent identification of substituents in computational analyses.
  
  - *Example*: Specify "Modifiers with an amino group at the para (4-) position of benzoic acid" instead of "Modifiers with amino groups at para positions."

- **Advice 5**: **Define Rules Based on Electron-Withdrawing/DONATING Parameters**

  - *Explanation*: Use quantifiable electronic parameters, such as Hammett sigma constants, to classify substituents as electron-withdrawing or electron-donating. This allows for numerical representation of electronic effects in the feature matrix.
  
  - *Example*: Assign numerical values to substituents based on their sigma constants and create a rule like "Modifiers with substituents having σ_p > 0.5 lead to high yield."

- **Advice 6**: **Reformulate Bulky Substituent Effects Using Steric Parameters**

  - *Explanation*: Quantify the steric hindrance of substituents using parameters like the Taft steric parameter (Es) or by calculating the van der Waals volume. This converts qualitative observations into numerical data.
  
  - *Example*: Define a threshold for van der Waals volume, such as "Modifiers with substituents having van der Waals volume > 100 Å³ result in variable yield."

- **Advice 7**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**

  - *Explanation*: Merge similar rules to reduce complexity and redundancy. This makes the rule set more manageable and the feature extraction process more efficient.
  
  - *Example*: Combine Rules 3 and 13 into a single rule about para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups enhancing yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Create a Hierarchical Rule Structure**

  - *Explanation*: Organize rules in a hierarchical manner, from general to specific. Primary rules could address broad structural features, while secondary rules refine the predictions based on additional functionalities.
  
  - *Example*: Primary Rule: "Modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids lead to high yield." Secondary Rule: "If the aromatic ring has a strong electron-withdrawing group at the para position, the yield is further enhanced."

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Machine-Learning-Friendly Features**

  - *Explanation*: Structure the rules to facilitate their use in machine learning models by ensuring that all features are numerical and normalized. Avoid categorical variables where possible or encode them appropriately (e.g., one-hot encoding).
  
  - *Example*: Represent functional groups as binary features (1 if present, 0 if absent), and normalize continuous variables like molecular weight.

- **Advice 10**: **Automate Feature Extraction with Software Tools**

  - *Explanation*: Use cheminformatics software such as RDKit to automatically compute the descriptors and identify substructures based on the revised rules. This ensures consistency and saves time.
  
  - *Example*: Write scripts that parse SMILES strings and compute all necessary features for each modifier.

- **Advice 11**: **Validate and Update Rules Based on Statistical Analysis**

  - *Explanation*: Perform statistical analysis on the dataset to identify which descriptors significantly impact the yield. Use this data-driven approach to refine existing rules or create new ones.
  
  - *Example*: Use regression analysis to find correlations between yield and descriptors like LogP or hydrogen bond donor count.

- **Advice 12**: **Document Rules with Clear Computational Definitions**

  - *Explanation*: Provide precise definitions and computational criteria for each rule, ensuring that anyone can understand and apply them without ambiguity.
  
  - *Example*: For each rule, include the exact SMARTS pattern used and the computational method for any descriptors.

- **Advice 13**: **Include Exceptions and Boundary Conditions**

  - *Explanation*: Identify any exceptions to the rules and define boundary conditions where the rule may not apply. This helps improve the accuracy of predictions.
  
  - *Example*: Note that while modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups generally lead to low yield, exceptions may occur if other high-yield-promoting features are present.

- **Advice 14**: **Integrate 3D Descriptors if Necessary**

  - *Explanation*: If steric effects are significant, consider incorporating 3D molecular descriptors such as molecular volume or surface area, which can be calculated from SMILES with appropriate software.
  
  - *Example*: Use the molecular solvent-accessible surface area to assess steric hindrance effects on yield.

- **Advice 15**: **Provide a Mapping Guide from Rules to Features**

  - *Explanation*: Create a reference that maps each rule to the corresponding computational feature or descriptor. This aids in feature extraction and ensures consistency across the dataset.
  
  - *Example*: Rule Mapping Guide:
    - Rule 1: Aliphatic chain length (`Chain_Length` ≤ 8), `Is_Aliphatic` = 1, `Has_Carboxyl_Group` = 1
    - Rule 7: `Contains_Heterocycle` = 1, `Has_Carboxyl_Group` = 1

    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

- **Rule 7**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Remote Amino or Hydroxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths longer than six carbons and have amino (–NH₂) or hydroxyl (–OH) groups located away from the carboxyl group (e.g., at the omega position).
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Remote functional groups may not effectively interact with the catalyst, and longer chains can introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - **Examples**:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers Containing Aldehyde Groups on Aromatic Rings Lead to Low Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers that have an aldehyde (–CHO) functional group attached directly to the aromatic ring, particularly at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or deactivate catalysts by forming adducts, reducing the overall yield.
  - **Examples**:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 11**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Influence Yield Based on Side Chain Structure**
  - **Description**:
    - **Phenyl Side Chains**: Amino acids with phenyl (benzene ring) side chains tend to result in **low yield**.
    - **Heteroaromatic Side Chains**: Amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains (containing heteroatoms like nitrogen) tend to result in **high yield**.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Phenyl side chains may not interact favorably with the catalyst, whereas heteroaromatic side chains can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.
  - **Examples**:
    - Low Yield: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (L-phenylalanine)
    - High Yield: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-tryptophan)
  - **Prediction**: Yield is influenced by the nature of the aromatic side chain.

- **Rule 12**: **Hydroxyphenylalkanoic Acids Influence Yield Based on Chain Length**
  - **Description**: Modifiers where a hydroxyphenyl group is connected via an aliphatic chain; the length of the chain affects the yield.
    - **Short Chains (3 Carbons)**: Tend to result in **low yield**.
    - **Longer Chains (5 Carbons)**: Tend to result in **high yield**.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Longer aliphatic chains may reduce steric hindrance and allow better interaction between functional groups and the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - Low Yield: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
    - High Yield: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - **Prediction**: Yield increases with longer aliphatic chains separating the hydroxyphenyl group from the carboxyl group.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide (–CONH–) linkages near the carboxylic acid group, especially when the amide connects the carboxyl group to an aromatic ring.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide bonds can alter the electronic properties of the carboxyl group and may interfere with catalyst binding and reactivity.
  - **Examples**:
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers Containing Perfluoroalkyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**
  - **Description**: Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups, where the alkyl chain is fully fluorinated, are highly electron-withdrawing and can affect catalyst interactions.
  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluoroalkyl groups increase electron deficiency and may hinder effective coordination with the catalyst due to strong electron-withdrawing effects.
  - **Examples**:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers Containing Ketone Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Influence Yield Based on Substituents**
  - **Description**: Modifiers where a ketone (–C=O) group is adjacent to the carboxyl group can affect yield based on the overall structure.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**
- **Suggestion 1**: **Implement Chain Length and Distance Constraints**  
  - For rules that involve chain length or distance between functional groups (e.g., Rule 1, Rule 7, Rule 12), the code needs to calculate and consider these distances. Specifically:
    - For **Rule 1**, ensure that the carbon chain length is within the specified range (3 to 6 carbons). You could add a function to count the number of carbons in the aliphatic chain between the amino and carboxyl groups.
    - For **Rule 7**, implement logic to determine if the amino or hydroxyl groups are located remotely (e.g., at the omega position). You might compute the shortest path between the carboxyl group and the amino/hydroxyl group to assess their separation.
    - For **Rule 12**, calculate the length of the aliphatic chain connecting the hydroxyphenyl group to the carboxyl group and adjust the prediction based on whether it's short (3 carbons) or longer (5 carbons).

- **Suggestion 2**: **Handle Conditional Predictions Appropriately**  
  - For rules with conditional predictions (e.g., Rule 11 and Rule 15), the code should include logic to determine the specific condition and assign the correct prediction accordingly. For example:
    - In **Rule 11**, determine whether the amino acid has a **phenyl side chain** (predict **low yield**) or a **heteroaromatic side chain** (predict **high yield**) and set the prediction based on this distinction.
    - In **Rule 15**, analyze the substituents on the ketone adjacent to the carboxyl group to decide whether the molecule falls into the **low yield** or **high yield** category.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine SMARTS Patterns to Match Intended Structures**  
  - Review and adjust the SMARTS patterns to accurately capture the intended molecules without including undesired ones. For example:
    - For **Rule 1**, the pattern `['[NX3;H2][CX4]']` might match any primary amine attached to a carbon, including those not part of amino acids. To be more specific, you could modify it to `['[NX3;H2][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` to ensure it matches amino acids specifically, including the alpha carbon and carboxylic acid group.
    - For **Rule 4**, ensure that the exclusion patterns correctly exclude molecules with additional functional groups beyond the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Implement Overlap Handling and Rule Prioritization**  
  - Since some molecules may match multiple rules, the code should have a mechanism to handle overlaps and prioritize rules appropriately. You could assign priorities to rules or define a hierarchy so that if a molecule matches multiple rules, the most relevant rule determines the prediction.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Integrate Molecular Property Calculations**  
  - For rules based on electronic effects or specific substituents (e.g., electron-withdrawing/donating groups), incorporate calculations of molecular properties:
    - Determine the presence of electron-withdrawing or donating groups in **Rule 2** and **Rule 6** by analyzing substituent effects.
    - For **Rule 14**, ensure that perfluoroalkyl groups are correctly identified by checking for fully fluorinated alkyl chains rather than just the presence of multiple fluorine atoms.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Correct Exclusion Patterns and Ensure Accurate Substructure Matches**  
  - Review the exclusion patterns in the code to ensure they correctly exclude undesired structures. For example:
    - In **Rule 4**, the exclusion pattern `['[O;!$([OX1,OX2]=[CX3])]', ... ]` may not effectively exclude alcohols and ethers. Adjust the patterns to accurately exclude these functional groups.
    - Use more precise SMARTS patterns to avoid false positives and false negatives in substructure searches.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Enhance Substructure Searching with Advanced Techniques**  
  - Utilize recursive SMARTS patterns or graph-based methods to capture structural features involving variable chain lengths or specific positions of functional groups. This can help in accurately identifying patterns like remote functional groups or specific ring systems.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Improve Error Handling and Molecule Parsing**  
  - Ensure that the code robustly handles molecules that cannot be parsed by RDKit, providing informative error messages and consistent handling of such cases. This will prevent invalid molecules from affecting the feature matrix.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Include Validation and Unit Testing**  
  - Develop a set of test cases with known expected outcomes to validate that each rule is correctly implemented. Unit tests can help verify that the code changes produce the correct feature matrix entries for a variety of molecules.

  - **Consideration:** While lower support indicates that the rules apply to fewer cases, it can also mean that the rules are more specific.

#### **Confidence**

- **Increase in Confidence:**
  - **Current Confidence:** 68.36%
  - **Previous Confidence:** ~58.74%
  - **Implication:** The probability that the rule's prediction is correct when the rule conditions are met has increased.
  - **Significance:** Higher confidence suggests that the rules are more reliable for prediction in the dataset they cover.

#### **Lift**

- **Increase in Lift:**
  - **Current Lift:** 1.3692
  - **Previous Lift:** ~1.1304
  - **Implication:** The current rules are more effective at predicting the outcome compared to random chance.
  - **Significance:**
    - **Lift > 1:** Indicates a positive association between the rule conditions and the prediction.
    - **Higher Lift:** Suggests that the rule provides valuable insights beyond the baseline probability.

#### **Leverage**

- **Slight Decrease in Leverage:**
  - **Current Leverage:** 0.0114
  - **Previous Leverage:** ~0.0124
  - **Implication:** The current rules contribute slightly less additional support over expected by chance compared to previous rules.
  - **Note:** Leverage is less critical when focusing on confidence and lift but still provides context.

---

### **3. Interpretation of Results**

- **Trade-off Between Support and Confidence/Lift:**
  - **Reduced Support:** The rules are more specialized, applying to fewer instances.
  - **Increased Confidence and Lift:** The rules are more accurate and meaningful within those instances.

- **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
  - **High Confidence:** Indicates strong predictive power when the rule conditions are met.
  - **High Lift:** Demonstrates that the rules are significant and not due to random chance.

- **Potential Local Minimum:**
  - **Plateau in Metrics:** The increase in confidence and lift suggests improvement, but the decrease in support might indicate that further iterations may not yield better generalizable rules.
  - **Risk of Overfitting:** High confidence on a small support may mean the rules are too tailored to the training data and may not perform well on unseen data.

---

### **4. Recommendations for Improvement**

#### **Balancing Support with Confidence and Lift**

- **Goal:** Increase support while maintaining high confidence and lift to ensure the rules are both accurate and widely applicable.

#### **Strategies:**

1. **Rule Generalization:**
   - **Simplify Rules:** Examine if the rules can be generalized without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
   - **Combine Similar Rules:** Merge rules that have overlapping conditions to cover more data instances.

2. **Adjusting Rule Parameters:**
   - **Support Threshold:**
     - **Increase Minimum Support:** Encourage the generation of rules that apply to more instances.
   - **Confidence Threshold:**
     - **Maintain or Slightly Reduce:** Allow for slightly less confident rules that apply more broadly.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - **Identify Key Features:**
     - Focus on the most influential physical-chemical properties that affect yield.
   - **Create Composite Features:**
     - Combine related features to capture broader patterns (e.g., grouping similar functional groups).

4. **Review and Refine Rules:**
   - **Evaluate Rule Specificity:**
     - Check if the rules are too narrowly defined due to overly specific conditions.
   - **Incorporate Domain Knowledge:**
     - Use expert insights to adjust rules in a way that aligns with chemical principles.

5. **Cross-Validation:**
   - **Test Rules on Validation Sets:**
     - Ensure that high confidence and lift are not just artifacts of the training data.
   - **Monitor Performance on Unseen Data:**
     - Observe how the rules perform on test datasets to assess generalizability.

---

### **5. Conclusion**

- **Current State:**
  - The current rules show improved confidence and lift but at the cost of reduced support.
  - This indicates that while the rules are strong predictors, they apply to a smaller subset of data.

- **Local Minimum Assessment:**
  - There is potential that a local minimum has been reached concerning the trade-off between rule specificity and applicability.
  - However, there may still be room for improvement by adjusting rule parameters and generalizing conditions.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Implement the recommended strategies to enhance the rules' applicability without significantly compromising their predictive strength.
  - Continue iterating, with a focus on balancing support with confidence and lift, to achieve robust and generalizable rules.

---

**Final Thoughts:**

- **Iteration Importance:** The iterative process is crucial in fine-tuning the rules to strike the optimal balance between coverage (support) and predictive power (confidence and lift).
- **Holistic Evaluation:** Always consider the interplay between different metrics rather than focusing solely on one, to develop comprehensive and effective rules.
- **Domain Expertise Integration:** Leveraging chemical knowledge can greatly enhance rule development, ensuring that statistical patterns align with scientific principles.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules:**

Based on the latest training results, the performance of the current rules shows a decline compared to previous iterations. The validation accuracy obtained is **0.6857**, which is lower than the previous validation accuracies consistently at **0.76**. This decrease suggests that the current rules may not be effectively capturing the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions.

The lower validation accuracy indicates that the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data has diminished. It's important to assess whether this is due to underfitting, overfitting, or specific rules that are not performing optimally.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values:**

The SHAP analysis provides valuable insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions, especially in cases where there is a discrepancy between predicted and experimental values.

- **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

  In several cases, the model predicts a low loading while the experimental value is high. This suggests that certain rules are contributing negatively to the prediction of high loading.

  - **Molecules Affected:**
    - *C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
    - *C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O*
    - *C(CCN)CC(=O)O*
    - *C1=CC2=C(C=C1C(=O)O)C(=O)OC2=O*
    - *COC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C(=O)CCC(=O)O)OC*
    - *C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O*
    - *CCCCCCCC(=O)O*
    - *C(CS)C(=O)O*
    - *C(C(=O)O)NC(CO)(CO)CO*
    - *C1=CC(=CC=C1CCCCC(=O)O)O*
    - *C(COCCOCCN)C(=O)O*
    - *C(C(=O)O)NC(CO)(CO)CO*
    - *C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O*
    - *C(CCCN)CCC(=O)O*

  - **Contributing Rules:**
    - **Rule 2** consistently has negative SHAP values for high loading in these cases, ranging approximately from -0.02 to -0.07.
    - **Rule 3** also contributes negative SHAP values, often around -0.04 to -0.10.
  
  - **Interpretation:**
    - The negative SHAP values indicate that these rules are pushing the prediction towards low loading, which is incorrect for these molecules.
    - This suggests that **Rule 2** and **Rule 3** may be too rigid or not adequately capturing the features that lead to high loading for these molecules.

- **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

  There's a case where the model predicts a high loading while the experimental value is low.

  - **Molecule Affected:**
    - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=NC=C2)C(=O)O*

  - **Contributing Rules:**
    - **Rule 3** has a high positive SHAP value for high loading (approximately +0.5313).
    - **Rule 2** has a negative SHAP value (-0.0313), indicating that it partially offsets the overestimation but not sufficiently.

  - **Interpretation:**
    - The high positive SHAP value from **Rule 3** suggests that it is incorrectly contributing to the prediction of high loading for this molecule.
    - This indicates that **Rule 3** may be overgeneralizing or not accounting for certain structural features that lead to low loading.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

- **Underfitting:**
  - The overall decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the model may be underfitting.
  - The current rules might be too simplistic or not fully capturing the complexity of the relationships in the data.
  - There's a need to enhance the rules to better model the underlying chemistry.

- **Overfitting:**
  - Given that the validation accuracy is consistently lower, overfitting is less likely.
  - However, some rules might be overfitting to specific patterns that do not generalize well, as seen with **Rule 3** overestimating loading in certain cases.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics:**

- The decrease in validation accuracy from 0.76 to 0.6857 suggests that the current rules are not improving the model's predictive capabilities.
- This decline indicates that modifications made in the current iteration may have reduced the effectiveness of the model.
- The consistent lower accuracy suggests that further refinement of the rules is needed to achieve better performance.

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- **Rule 2 Issues:**
  - **Rule 2** is meant to predict high yield for "Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups at the Para Position."
  - Negative SHAP values in molecules with high experimental loading suggest that **Rule 2** may be excluding relevant functional groups or not accounting for certain electron-withdrawing groups.
  - Molecules like *C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N* and *C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)* may possess features that **Rule 2** doesn't capture.

- **Rule 3 Issues:**
  - **Rule 3** focuses on "Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids Lead to High Yield."
  - The overestimation in *C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=NC=C2)C(=O)O* suggests that **Rule 3** may be too broad.
  - It may include heteroaromatic compounds that do not actually result in high loading, indicating a need for more specificity.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Rule 2:**

   - **Issue Identified:**
     - Negative SHAP values in molecules where high loading is experimentally observed.
   - **Suggested Actions:**
     - **Expand Functional Group Consideration:**
       - Include additional electron-withdrawing groups, such as carboxyl, sulfonyl, or halogens in ortho and meta positions.
     - **Include Aliphatic Amino Acids:**
       - Update the rule to better account for aliphatic amino acids that have shown high loading but are currently misclassified.
     - **Adjust Positional Criteria:**
       - Consider electron-withdrawing groups in positions other than just para, as their influence may still be significant.

2. **Adjust Rule 3:**

   - **Issue Identified:**
     - Overestimation of loading in molecules that do not result in high experimental loading.
   - **Suggested Actions:**
     - **Specify Heteroaromatic Rings:**
       - Define which heteroaromatic systems (e.g., pyridine, pyrrole) lead to high loading and exclude those that do not contribute positively.
     - **Incorporate Additional Criteria:**
       - Include steric hindrance, ring size, or the presence of additional substituents that may affect loading.

3. **Introduce a New Rule for Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups:**

   - **Rationale:**
     - Molecules like *C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O* (which is gluconic acid) have multiple hydroxyl groups and show high experimental loading but are predicted low.
   - **Suggested Rule:**
     - **Rule X:** *"Aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy acids) tend to result in high yield."*
     - **Underlying Reasoning:**
       - Multiple hydroxyl groups may facilitate better interaction with the catalyst through hydrogen bonding or chelation.

4. **Enhance Generalization to Address Underfitting:**

   - **Include Additional Descriptors:**
     - Augment the feature matrix with descriptors such as molecular weight, polar surface area, and hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.
   - **Reevaluate Existing Rules:**
     - Assess all rules to identify any that may be too narrow or broad and adjust accordingly.
   - **Use Machine Learning Algorithms:**
     - Consider complementing rule-based predictions with machine learning models that can capture non-linear relationships.

5. **Leverage SHAP Insights for Rule Refinement:**

   - **Identify Common Features in Misclassified Molecules:**
     - Analyze structural similarities among misclassified molecules to inform rule adjustments.
   - **Iteratively Test Rule Changes:**
     - After modifying rules, perform validation to ensure that changes lead to improved accuracy.

6. **Avoid Overcomplicating the Model:**

   - **Balance Specificity and Generalization:**
     - While refining rules, ensure they are neither too specific (overfitting) nor too general (underfitting).
   - **Monitor Model Complexity:**
     - Keep the number of rules manageable to maintain interpretability and avoid overfitting.

**Conclusion:**

The current rules need to be refined to improve predictive performance. Key actions include adjusting **Rule 2** and **Rule 3** based on SHAP analysis insights, introducing new rules to cover previously overlooked molecular features, and enhancing the generalization capability of the model. By iteratively refining the rules and validating their impact on model accuracy, we can improve the likelihood of accurately predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules:**

Recent analyses have highlighted both strengths and areas for improvement in the current set of rules used to predict the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. Key points from the discussions include:

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - An **increase in confidence and lift** indicates that when the rules apply, they are more accurate and meaningful compared to previous iterations.
  - A **decrease in support** suggests that the rules now cover a smaller portion of the dataset, indicating higher specificity but reduced general applicability.

- **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
  - Certain rules, particularly **Rule 2** and **Rule 3**, are contributing to incorrect predictions for specific molecules.
    - **Rule 2** tends to underestimate the yield for molecules that experimentally have high yield.
    - **Rule 3** sometimes overestimates the yield for molecules that actually have low experimental yield.

- **Model Performance:**
  - The overall validation accuracy has decreased from previous iterations, suggesting that the current rules may not be fully capturing the necessary patterns for accurate predictions.

**Directions and Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups):**
   - **Expand Consideration of Electron-Withdrawing Groups:**
     - Include additional groups like halogens (–F, –Cl, –Br), carboxyl (–COOH), and sulfonyl (–SO₂–) groups.
   - **Adjust Positional Criteria:**
     - Consider electron-withdrawing groups in **ortho** and **meta** positions, not just **para**, as they can also influence electronic properties.
   - **Enhance SMARTS Patterns:**
     - Modify SMARTS to accurately capture the presence and position of various electron-withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring.

2. **Refine Rule 3 (Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids):**
   - **Specify Heteroaromatic Ring Types:**
     - Limit to heteroaromatic rings known to enhance yield, such as pyridine and pyrazole, and exclude others like indole if they do not contribute positively.
   - **Consider Substituents on Rings:**
     - Account for additional groups on the heteroaromatic ring that might affect coordination with the catalyst.

3. **Introduce New Rules for Overlooked Patterns:**
   - **Polyhydroxy Acids:**
     - **Rule Addition:** Recognize that **aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups** (e.g., gluconic acid) result in high yield due to enhanced interactions with the catalyst through hydrogen bonding.
   - **Modifiers with Specific Functional Group Arrangements:**
     - Analyze misclassified molecules to identify common structural features for new rules.

4. **Implement Chain Length and Distance Constraints:**
   - **Calculate Carbon Chain Lengths:**
     - Accurately determine the number of carbons between functional groups (e.g., amino and carboxyl groups) in amino acids.
   - **Measure Functional Group Distances:**
     - Use cheminformatics tools to assess the spatial separation of functional groups, which can influence reactivity.

5. **Enhance SMARTS Patterns and Substructure Searches:**
   - **Improve Specificity:**
     - Refine patterns to precisely match target structures, reducing false positives/negatives.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2 to Include Additional Electron-Withdrawing Groups and Positions**

  - **Action**: Expand Rule 2 to consider additional electron-withdrawing groups such as halogens (–F, –Cl, –Br), cyano (–CN), carboxyl (–COOH), and sulfonyl (–SO₂–) groups.
  - **Adjust Positional Criteria**: Include electron-withdrawing groups in ortho and meta positions, not just at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.
  - **Modify SMARTS Patterns**:
    - Update the SMARTS pattern to capture various electron-withdrawing groups at any position on the aromatic ring.
    - Example SMARTS pattern: `c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H])c([F,Cl,Br,N+](=O)[O-],N#C,SO2[O-,OH])c1` (This pattern represents a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid and an electron-withdrawing group attached to it.)
  - **Justification**: This refinement will broaden the rule's applicability and improve the model's ability to predict high-yield modifiers by accurately capturing more electron-deficient aromatic carboxylic acids.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rule 3 by Specifying Beneficial Heteroaromatic Rings and Substituents**

  - **Action**: Limit Rule 3 to include only heteroaromatic carboxylic acids that are proven to enhance yield, such as those containing pyridine and pyrazole rings.
  - **Exclude Non-Beneficial Rings**: Exclude heteroaromatic rings like indole and benzofuran if they do not contribute positively to the yield.
  - **Consider Substituents**: Account for substituents on the heteroaromatic ring that might affect catalyst coordination, such as electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups.
  - **Modify SMARTS Patterns**:
    - Focus on specific heteroaromatic systems.
    - Example SMARTS patterns:
      - Pyridine carboxylic acids: `c1ccncc1C(=O)[O-]`
      - Pyrazole carboxylic acids: `c1c[nH]nc1C(=O)[O-]`
  - **Justification**: By specifying the heteroaromatic rings and considering substituent effects, the rule will more accurately predict high-yield modifiers and reduce false positives.

- **Advice 4**: **Implement Accurate Chain Length and Functional Group Distance Constraints**

  - **Action**: Incorporate precise calculations of carbon chain lengths and distances between functional groups in relevant rules.
  - **Adjust Rules**:
    - For Rule 7, specify that aliphatic carboxylic acids with remote amino or hydroxyl groups beyond a certain chain length (e.g., more than six carbons) lead to low yield.
    - Use cheminformatics tools to determine the exact number of carbons between functional groups.
  - **Modify SMARTS Patterns**:
    - Include quantifiers to specify chain lengths.
    - Example: `O=C[OH]/CCCCC[NH2]` for a carboxylic acid with an amino group seven carbons away.
  - **Justification**: This improves rule precision by ensuring that only modifiers with the appropriate chain lengths and functional group positions are matched.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance SMARTS Patterns for Greater Specificity and Accuracy**

  - **Action**: Refine SMARTS patterns to precisely match target structures and avoid unintended matches.
  - **Use Recursive SMARTS and Logical Operators**:
    - Employ advanced features like recursive SMARTS to capture complex patterns.
    - Example: Use `[$(c1cc([NX3;H2])ccc1),$(c1cc([#8,NX2,SX2])ccc1)]` to match aromatic rings substituted with specific functional groups.
  - **Test and Validate Patterns**:
    - Verify that the SMARTS patterns accurately identify the intended molecules in the dataset.
  - **Justification**: Enhanced SMARTS patterns reduce false positives and negatives, leading to more reliable predictions.

- **Advice 6**: **Implement Logic for Conditional Rules and Prioritize Rule Application**

  - **Action**: Incorporate conditional logic in the code to handle rules with multiple outcomes based on molecular features.
  - **Adjust Conditional Rules**:
    - For Rule 11 (Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains), implement a decision tree that predicts yield based on the side chain type.
  - **Prioritize Rules**:
    - Assign priorities or weights to rules to resolve conflicts when a molecule matches multiple rules.
    - Apply higher-priority rules first.
  - **Justification**: Proper handling of conditional rules ensures accurate predictions and consistent application across the dataset.

- **Advice 7**: **Review and Correct Exclusion Patterns in SMARTS**

  - **Action**: Examine the exclusion patterns used in SMARTS to ensure they effectively prevent undesired matches without excluding valid modifiers.
  - **Adjust Patterns**:
    - For example, to exclude modifiers with aldehyde groups on aromatic rings, use `[$(c1ccc([CX3H1](=O))cc1)]` as an exclusion criterion.
  - **Test Exclusions Thoroughly**:
    - Validate the exclusion patterns against known molecules to confirm they are working as intended.
  - **Justification**: Correct exclusion patterns prevent false positives and improve the specificity of the rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Develop Test Cases and Implement Unit Testing for Rules**

  - **Action**: Create a diverse set of test molecules with known outcomes to evaluate each rule.
  - **Implement Unit Tests**:
    - Write tests that check whether each rule triggers correctly and yields the expected prediction.
  - **Iterative Refinement**:
    - Use test results to refine rules and SMARTS patterns.
  - **Justification**: Systematic testing ensures that rules function as intended and increases confidence in the model's predictions.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Molecular Property Calculations into Rules**

  - **Action**: Integrate calculated molecular descriptors, such as Hammett σ values, electron densities, and steric parameters, to inform rule predictions.
  - **Adjust Rules Based on Quantitative Data**:
    - Use threshold values of descriptors to refine the criteria within rules.
    - For example, set a cutoff for Hammett σ values to distinguish between strong and moderate electron-withdrawing groups.
  - **Justification**: Quantitative data enhances the ability of rules to discriminate between modifiers and improves prediction accuracy.

- **Advice 10**: **Balance Rule Specificity to Improve Generalization and Avoid Overfitting**

  - **Action**: Ensure that rules are neither too broad nor too narrow, capturing general trends without being overly restrictive.
  - **Cross-Validation**:
    - Perform cross-validation to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
  - **Adjust Rules Accordingly**:
    - If a rule is too specific, consider broadening it slightly.
    - If a rule is too general, add additional constraints.
  - **Justification**: Balancing specificity helps the model generalize better to new molecules and prevents overfitting to the current dataset.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Attached to Aromatic Rings Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the aromatic ring, particularly at positions that are ortho or para to the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can undergo side reactions, such as forming Schiff bases with amino groups. This may deactivate the catalyst or divert the reactants, reducing the overall yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing thiol (–SH) groups attached directly to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic thiol groups can strongly bind to metal centers in a manner that may poison or deactivate the catalyst. This strong, irreversible binding can block active sites necessary for catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Influence Yield Based on Side Chain Structure**

  - **Description**:
    - **Aromatic Side Chains Without Coordinating Heteroatoms**: Amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine) result in **low yield**.
    - **Aromatic Side Chains with Coordinating Heteroatoms**: Amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains that can coordinate with metals (e.g., tryptophan) result in **high yield**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic side chains without coordinating sites may introduce steric hindrance or do not contribute to catalyst interaction. In contrast, heteroaromatic side chains with nitrogen atoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Prediction**: Yield is influenced by the presence of coordinating heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers Containing Perfluoroalkyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have perfluorinated alkyl chains, where all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and can significantly reduce the electron density of the carboxyl group. This can impair the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst, leading to reduced yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide (–CONH–) linkages near the carboxylic acid group, especially when the amide connects the carboxyl group to an aromatic ring or another functional group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide bonds can alter the electronic properties of nearby functional groups and may hinder effective coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst. They can also introduce rigidity or steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Compound **23**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Ketone Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Influence Yield Based on Additional Substituents**

  - **Description**:
    - **Simple Ketone Acids**: Modifiers with ketone (–C=O) groups adjacent to carboxyl groups without additional electron-donating substituents result in **low yield**.
    - **Ketone Acids with Electron-Donating Groups**: Modifiers where the ketone group is adjacent to electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy-substituted aromatics) can result in **high yield**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ketone groups can interact with the catalyst, potentially inhibiting activity. However, electron-donating substituents can counteract this effect by enhancing electron density and facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Compound **27**)
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**)

  - **Prediction**: Yield is influenced by the presence of electron-donating groups near the ketone.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Short Aliphatic Chains Connecting Hydroxyphenyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where a hydroxyphenyl group is connected to the carboxyl group via a short aliphatic chain (e.g., three carbons).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Short aliphatic chains may not provide sufficient flexibility or optimal spacing for effective interaction with the catalyst. Steric hindrance between the hydroxyphenyl group and the catalyst can reduce yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Compound **30**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Highly Hydroxylated Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and provide additional sites for hydrogen bonding or coordination with the catalyst. This can increase the modifier's interaction with the catalyst surface, enhancing reactivity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing or Coordinating Groups at the Para Position Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para (4-) position with electron-withdrawing groups or groups capable of coordinating to metal ions. These groups include nitro (–NO₂), amino (–NH₂), bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), and hydroxyl (–OH).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to interact with metal centers. Coordinating groups such as amino and hydroxyl groups can form additional bonds with metal ions, stabilizing the catalyst and improving its reactivity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing heteroaromatic rings, such as pyridine, pyrazole, benzofuran, or pyridinone rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) in the aromatic ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and facilitating electron transfer processes. This coordination improves the overall reactivity of the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

  - **Exception**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**) results in **low yield**, possibly due to steric hindrance or deactivating effects from the pyridyl group at the para position.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will generally result in **high yield**, with noted exceptions.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Amino Acids with Amino and Carboxylic Acid Groups Result in High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids containing both an amino group (–NH₂) and one or more carboxylic acid groups (–COOH), particularly those with short aliphatic side chains (3 to 5 carbons).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups allows for chelation with metal centers in the catalyst. This dual coordination enhances catalyst stability and reactivity by providing multiple binding sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

  - **Exception**:
    - Amino acids with aromatic side chains like **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**) result in **low yield** due to potential steric hindrance or lack of effective coordination.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**, except for those with specific aromatic side chains.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of up to eight carbons and no additional functional groups beyond the terminal carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The simplicity and linearity of these molecules minimize steric hindrance, allowing efficient packing and interaction with the catalyst surface. This can enhance the catalyst's ability to facilitate the reaction.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Terminal Thiol Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing a thiol (–SH) group at the terminal (ω) position of the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups can form strong coordinate bonds with metal centers due to the lone pair electrons on sulfur. This strong interaction can enhance catalyst binding and electron transfer, improving catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Remote Functional Groups (Amino or Hydroxyl) on Long Aliphatic Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths longer than six carbons and contain amino (–NH₂) or hydroxyl (–OH) groups located away from the carboxyl group (e.g., at the ω-position).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Functional groups remote from the carboxyl group may not effectively interact with the catalyst's active sites. Additionally, longer carbon chains can introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Multiple Ether Linkages Result in Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing polyether chains with multiple ether (–O–) linkages, such as oligoethylene glycol chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and steric bulk, which can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. They may also block active sites or alter the local environment unfavorably.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Attached to Aromatic Rings Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the aromatic ring, particularly at positions that are ortho or para to the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can undergo side reactions, such as forming Schiff bases with amino groups. This may deactivate the catalyst or divert the reactants, reducing the overall yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing thiol (–SH) groups attached directly to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic thiol groups can strongly bind to metal centers in a manner that may poison or deactivate the catalyst. This strong, irreversible binding can block active sites necessary for catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Influence Yield Based on Side Chain Structure**

  - **Description**:
    - **Aromatic Side Chains Without Coordinating Heteroatoms**: Amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine) result in **low yield**.
    - **Aromatic Side Chains with Coordinating Heteroatoms**: Amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains that can coordinate with metals (e.g., tryptophan) result in **high yield**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic side chains without coordinating sites may introduce steric hindrance or do not contribute to catalyst interaction. In contrast, heteroaromatic side chains with nitrogen atoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Prediction**: Yield is influenced by the presence of coordinating heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers Containing Perfluoroalkyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have perfluorinated alkyl chains, where all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and can significantly reduce the electron density of the carboxyl group. This can impair the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst, leading to reduced yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide (–CONH–) linkages near the carboxylic acid group, especially when the amide connects the carboxyl group to an aromatic ring or another functional group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide bonds can alter the electronic properties of nearby functional groups and may hinder effective coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst. They can also introduce rigidity or steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Compound **23**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Ketone Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Influence Yield Based on Additional Substituents**

  - **Description**:
    - **Simple Ketone Acids**: Modifiers with ketone (–C=O) groups adjacent to carboxyl groups without additional electron-donating substituents result in **low yield**.
    - **Ketone Acids with Electron-Donating Groups**: Modifiers where the ketone group is adjacent to electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy-substituted aromatics) can result in **high yield**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ketone groups can interact with the catalyst, potentially inhibiting activity. However, electron-donating substituents can counteract this effect by enhancing electron density and facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Compound **27**)
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**)

  - **Prediction**: Yield is influenced by the presence of electron-donating groups near the ketone.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Short Aliphatic Chains Connecting Hydroxyphenyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where a hydroxyphenyl group is connected to the carboxyl group via a short aliphatic chain (e.g., three carbons).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Short aliphatic chains may not provide sufficient flexibility or optimal spacing for effective interaction with the catalyst. Steric hindrance between the hydroxyphenyl group and the catalyst can reduce yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Compound **30**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Highly Hydroxylated Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and provide additional sites for hydrogen bonding or coordination with the catalyst. This can increase the modifier's interaction with the catalyst surface, enhancing reactivity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Update Rule 1 to Specify Substituent Positions**

  Modify the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 1** to explicitly require that the electron-withdrawing or coordinating group is at the **para position** relative to the carboxylic acid on the aromatic ring. This can be achieved by incorporating position-specific SMARTS patterns that define the para relationship. For example, use the following pattern for para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids:

  ```python
  # Para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acid with specific groups
  para_substituted_aromatic = 'c1ccc(cc1[X])C(=O)O'
  ```

  where `[X]` represents the substituent groups (nitro, amino, bromomethyl, hydroxyl). You can define `[X]` as a SMARTS pattern that matches any of these groups.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Define Substituent Groups and Incorporate into Para Position**

  Create SMARTS patterns for each substituent group and incorporate them into the para position pattern. For example:

  ```python
  # Substituent groups
  nitro_group = '[N+](=O)[O-]'
  amino_group = 'NH2'
  bromomethyl_group = 'CH2Br'
  hydroxyl_group = 'OH'

  # Para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acid
  para_nitrobenzoic_acid = 'c1ccc(cc1[N+](=O)[O-])C(=O)O'
  para_aminobenzoic_acid = 'c1ccc(cc1[NH2])C(=O)O'
  para_bromomethylbenzoic_acid = 'c1ccc(cc1[CH2Br])C(=O)O'
  para_hydroxybenzoic_acid = 'c1ccc(cc1[OH])C(=O)O'
  ```

  Then, include these patterns in **Rule 1** to ensure that only para-substituted compounds are matched.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine Patterns for Other Rules Requiring Specific Positions**

  Review other rules that depend on the position of functional groups (e.g., ortho or meta substitution) or specific chain lengths and adjust the SMARTS patterns accordingly. Use position-specific SMARTS and atom mapping to accurately capture the structural features described in the natural language rules.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Enhance SMARTS Patterns for Chain Lengths and Terminal Groups**

  For rules involving aliphatic chain lengths and terminal functional groups (e.g., **Rule 4** and **Rule 5**), ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately reflect the specified chain lengths and terminal positions. For example, for an aliphatic carboxylic acid with up to eight carbons:

  ```python
  aliphatic_carboxylic_acid = '[CH3][CH2]{0,6}C(=O)O'
  ```

  This pattern allows for aliphatic chains from one to eight carbons.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Implement Exception Handling and Specificity for Each Rule**

  Incorporate exception handling in the code to account for any noted exceptions in the rules. For example, in **Rule 2**, compound **12** is an exception that leads to low yield. The code should be adjusted to exclude this specific case or to include additional patterns that capture such exceptions.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Validate SMARTS Patterns with Example Compounds**

  Use the provided example compounds for each rule to test and validate the SMARTS patterns. Ensure that the patterns correctly match the examples and do not incorrectly match compounds that should not be included.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Use Recursive SMARTS or Logical Operators for Complex Patterns**

  For complex structural descriptions, consider using recursive SMARTS patterns or logical operators to combine multiple conditions. This can improve the accuracy of pattern matching for compounds that have multiple functional groups or structural requirements.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Add Comments and Documentation to Code**

  Include comments and documentation within the code to explain the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and how it relates to the corresponding natural language rule. This will make it easier to review and maintain the code.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing or Coordinating Groups at the Para Position Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para (4-) position with electron-withdrawing groups or groups capable of coordinating to metal ions. These groups include nitro (–NO₂), amino (–NH₂), bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), and hydroxyl (–OH).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to interact with metal centers. Coordinating groups such as amino and hydroxyl groups can form additional bonds with metal ions, stabilizing the catalyst and improving its reactivity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing heteroaromatic rings, such as pyridine, pyrazole, benzofuran, or pyridinone rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) in the aromatic ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and facilitating electron transfer processes. This coordination improves the overall reactivity of the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

  - **Exception**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**) results in **low yield**, possibly due to steric hindrance or deactivating effects from the pyridyl group at the para position.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will generally result in **high yield**, with noted exceptions.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Amino Acids with Amino and Carboxylic Acid Groups Result in High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids containing both an amino group (–NH₂) and one or more carboxylic acid groups (–COOH), particularly those with short aliphatic side chains (3 to 5 carbons).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups allows for chelation with metal centers in the catalyst. This dual coordination enhances catalyst stability and reactivity by providing multiple binding sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

  - **Exception**:
    - Amino acids with aromatic side chains like **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**) result in **low yield** due to potential steric hindrance or lack of effective coordination.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**, except for those with specific aromatic side chains.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of up to eight carbons and no additional functional groups beyond the terminal carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The simplicity and linearity of these molecules minimize steric hindrance, allowing efficient packing and interaction with the catalyst surface. This can enhance the catalyst's ability to facilitate the reaction.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Terminal Thiol Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing a thiol (–SH) group at the terminal (ω) position of the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups can form strong coordinate bonds with metal centers due to the lone pair electrons on sulfur. This strong interaction can enhance catalyst binding and electron transfer, improving catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Remote Functional Groups (Amino or Hydroxyl) on Long Aliphatic Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths longer than six carbons and contain amino (–NH₂) or hydroxyl (–OH) groups located away from the carboxyl group (e.g., at the ω-position).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Functional groups remote from the carboxyl group may not effectively interact with the catalyst's active sites. Additionally, longer carbon chains can introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Multiple Ether Linkages Result in Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing polyether chains with multiple ether (–O–) linkages, such as oligoethylene glycol chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and steric bulk, which can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. They may also block active sites or alter the local environment unfavorably.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Attached to Aromatic Rings Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the aromatic ring, particularly at positions that are ortho or para to the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can undergo side reactions, such as forming Schiff bases with amino groups. This may deactivate the catalyst or divert the reactants, reducing the overall yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing thiol (–SH) groups attached directly to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic thiol groups can strongly bind to metal centers in a manner that may poison or deactivate the catalyst. This strong, irreversible binding can block active sites necessary for catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Influence Yield Based on Side Chain Structure**

  - **Description**:
    - **Aromatic Side Chains Without Coordinating Heteroatoms**: Amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine) result in **low yield**.
    - **Aromatic Side Chains with Coordinating Heteroatoms**: Amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains that can coordinate with metals (e.g., tryptophan) result in **high yield**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic side chains without coordinating sites may introduce steric hindrance or do not contribute to catalyst interaction. In contrast, heteroaromatic side chains with nitrogen atoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Prediction**: Yield is influenced by the presence of coordinating heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers Containing Perfluoroalkyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have perfluorinated alkyl chains, where all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and can significantly reduce the electron density of the carboxyl group. This can impair the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst, leading to reduced yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide (–CONH–) linkages near the carboxylic acid group, especially when the amide connects the carboxyl group to an aromatic ring or another functional group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide bonds can alter the electronic properties of nearby functional groups and may hinder effective coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst. They can also introduce rigidity or steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Compound **23**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Ketone Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Influence Yield Based on Additional Substituents**

  - **Description**:
    - **Simple Ketone Acids**: Modifiers with ketone (–C=O) groups adjacent to carboxyl groups without additional electron-donating substituents result in **low yield**.
    - **Ketone Acids with Electron-Donating Groups**: Modifiers where the ketone group is adjacent to electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy-substituted aromatics) can result in **high yield**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ketone groups can interact with the catalyst, potentially inhibiting activity. However, electron-donating substituents can counteract this effect by enhancing electron density and facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Compound **27**)
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**)

  - **Prediction**: Yield is influenced by the presence of electron-donating groups near the ketone.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Short Aliphatic Chains Connecting Hydroxyphenyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where a hydroxyphenyl group is connected to the carboxyl group via a short aliphatic chain (e.g., three carbons).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Short aliphatic chains may not provide sufficient flexibility or optimal spacing for effective interaction with the catalyst. Steric hindrance between the hydroxyphenyl group and the catalyst can reduce yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Compound **30**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Highly Hydroxylated Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and provide additional sites for hydrogen bonding or coordination with the catalyst. This can increase the modifier's interaction with the catalyst surface, enhancing reactivity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: For **Rule 1**, the current SMARTS patterns do not ensure that the electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups are at the **para (4-) position** relative to the carboxylic acid on the aromatic ring. Modify the SMARTS patterns to enforce **para-substitution**. This can be achieved by defining a SMARTS pattern that specifies the substituents at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring. For example:
  - **Aromatic Carboxylic Acid with Para Substituent**: `c1cc([C](=O)[O])ccc1[!H]`
  - This pattern matches an aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid and another substituent at the para position.

- **Suggestion 2**: For **Rule 2**, the SMARTS pattern for `heteroaromatic_ring` (`[n,o,s]1cccc1`) is insufficient and incorrectly represents only five-membered rings. Update the pattern to include six-membered heteroaromatic rings and other specified heterocycles. You could use:
  - **Pyridine Ring**: `n1ccccc1`
  - **Pyrazole Ring**: `n1nccc1`
  - **Benzofuran Ring**: `c1ccc2occc2c1`
  - **Pyridinone Ring**: `O=C1C=CC=CN1`
  - Combine these patterns in the rule to match the heteroaromatic rings specified.

- **Suggestion 3**: For **Rule 3**, the `amino_acid` SMARTS pattern may not capture all amino acids with aliphatic side chains of 3 to 5 carbons. Adjust the pattern to match:
  - **General Amino Acid**: `N[C@@H](C)[C](=O)O`
  - Incorporate side chain length by specifying the number of carbons:
    - For 3 to 5 carbons: `N[C@@H](CC[CH2])C(=O)O`
  - Additionally, ensure that amino acids with **aromatic side chains** are excluded unless they contain coordinating heteroatoms, by updating the `exclude_patterns` accordingly.

- **Suggestion 4**: For **Rule 4**, the `long_aliphatic_carboxylic_acid` pattern `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]CCCCCCC` only matches chains of exactly seven carbons and may not account for variations. Modify the pattern to match chains from **six to eight carbons**:
  - **General Long-Chain Aliphatic Acid**: `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2]{4,6}[CH3]`
  - This pattern matches aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 7 carbons (excluding the carboxyl carbon).

- **Suggestion 5**: For **Rule 5**, the `terminal_thiol` pattern `[SX2H][#6]` is too general and may match non-terminal thiol groups. Adjust the pattern to ensure the thiol is at the **terminal position**:
  - **Terminal Thiol**: `[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`
  - **Thiol at Omega Position**: `[#6]~[CH2]~[SX2H]`
  - Combine these to ensure the thiol is at the end of the chain opposite the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 6**: For **Rules with Exceptions** (e.g., **Rule 2** and **Rule 3**), the code should explicitly **exclude the specified exceptions**. For Rule 2, add an `exclude_patterns` entry for **Compound 12**:
  - **Exclude Pattern for Compound 12**: `c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)c2ccncc2`
  - Use this pattern to exclude modifiers like 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid that do not follow the general trend.

- **Suggestion 7**: To handle **positional specificity** (e.g., ortho, meta, para positions), use **atom numbering and recursive SMARTS**. For example, to specify a substituent at the para position relative to the carboxyl group:
  - **Para-Substituted Aromatic Acid**: `c1ccc(cc1)[C](=O)O`
  - Use atom mapping to ensure the substituent is at the correct position.

- **Suggestion 8**: For **Rule 10**, differentiate between amino acids with aromatic side chains that **do** and **do not** have coordinating heteroatoms. Update the SMARTS patterns:
  - **Aromatic Amino Acid Without Heteroatoms (Low Yield)**: `N[C@@H](CC1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)O`
  - **Aromatic Amino Acid With Heteroatoms (High Yield)**: `N[C@@H](CC1=CNC2=CC=CC=C12)C(=O)O`
  - Ensure the code distinguishes between these two cases.

- **Suggestion 9**: For **Rule 13**, the code should consider **additional substituents** that influence yield. Modify the SMARTS patterns to:
  - **Simple Ketone Adjacent to Carboxyl (Low Yield)**: `[CX3](=O)[CX2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`
  - **Ketone with Electron-Donating Groups (High Yield)**: Include a pattern that checks for methoxy or other electron-donating groups near the ketone.

- **Suggestion 10**: Use **more specific SMARTS patterns** for each rule to reduce false positives/negatives. For example, define separate patterns for each functional group rather than combining multiple groups in a single pattern.

- **Suggestion 11**: Implement **unit tests** for each SMARTS pattern using known compounds. Verify that each pattern correctly matches the intended structures and does not match where it shouldn't.

- **Suggestion 12**: Utilize **RDKit's capabilities** for handling **stereochemistry** and **atom mapping** to improve structural specificity. For example, use `Chem.MolFromSmarts` with enhanced stereochemistry features.

- **Suggestion 13**: For rules involving **functional group proximity** (e.g., Rule 12 with amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups), ensure the SMARTS patterns specify the **adjacency and connectivity** accurately.

- **Suggestion 14**: For **Rule 15**, ensure that the SMARTS pattern for highly hydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids accurately captures the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups along the carbon chain. Update the pattern to:
  - **Polyhydroxy Aliphatic Acid**: `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2][CH](O)[CH](O)[CH](O)[CH2][OH]`

- **Suggestion 15**: Review all SMARTS patterns for **syntax errors** and **chemical accuracy**. Use RDKit's `Draw.MolToImage` to visualize substructure matches and confirm correctness.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing or Coordinating Groups at the Para Position Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para (4-) position with electron-withdrawing groups or groups capable of coordinating to metal ions. These groups include nitro (–NO₂), amino (–NH₂), bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), and hydroxyl (–OH).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to interact with metal centers. Coordinating groups such as amino and hydroxyl groups can form additional bonds with metal ions, stabilizing the catalyst and improving its reactivity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing heteroaromatic rings, such as pyridine, pyrazole, benzofuran, or pyridinone rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) in the aromatic ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and facilitating electron transfer processes. This coordination improves the overall reactivity of the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

  - **Exception**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**) results in **low yield**, possibly due to steric hindrance or deactivating effects from the pyridyl group at the para position.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will generally result in **high yield**, with noted exceptions.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Amino Acids with Amino and Carboxylic Acid Groups Result in High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids containing both an amino group (–NH₂) and one or more carboxylic acid groups (–COOH), particularly those with short aliphatic side chains (3 to 5 carbons).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups allows for chelation with metal centers in the catalyst. This dual coordination enhances catalyst stability and reactivity by providing multiple binding sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

  - **Exception**:
    - Amino acids with aromatic side chains like **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**) result in **low yield** due to potential steric hindrance or lack of effective coordination.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**, except for those with specific aromatic side chains.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of up to eight carbons and no additional functional groups beyond the terminal carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The simplicity and linearity of these molecules minimize steric hindrance, allowing efficient packing and interaction with the catalyst surface. This can enhance the catalyst's ability to facilitate the reaction.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Terminal Thiol Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing a thiol (–SH) group at the terminal (ω) position of the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups can form strong coordinate bonds with metal centers due to the lone pair electrons on sulfur. This strong interaction can enhance catalyst binding and electron transfer, improving catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Remote Functional Groups (Amino or Hydroxyl) on Long Aliphatic Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths longer than six carbons and contain amino (–NH₂) or hydroxyl (–OH) groups located away from the carboxyl group (e.g., at the ω-position).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Functional groups remote from the carboxyl group may not effectively interact with the catalyst's active sites. Additionally, longer carbon chains can introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Multiple Ether Linkages Result in Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing polyether chains with multiple ether (–O–) linkages, such as oligoethylene glycol chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and steric bulk, which can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. They may also block active sites or alter the local environment unfavorably.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Attached to Aromatic Rings Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the aromatic ring, particularly at positions that are ortho or para to the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can undergo side reactions, such as forming Schiff bases with amino groups. This may deactivate the catalyst or divert the reactants, reducing the overall yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing thiol (–SH) groups attached directly to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic thiol groups can strongly bind to metal centers in a manner that may poison or deactivate the catalyst. This strong, irreversible binding can block active sites necessary for catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Influence Yield Based on Side Chain Structure**

  - **Description**:
    - **Aromatic Side Chains Without Coordinating Heteroatoms**: Amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine) result in **low yield**.
    - **Aromatic Side Chains with Coordinating Heteroatoms**: Amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains that can coordinate with metals (e.g., tryptophan) result in **high yield**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic side chains without coordinating sites may introduce steric hindrance or do not contribute to catalyst interaction. In contrast, heteroaromatic side chains with nitrogen atoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Prediction**: Yield is influenced by the presence of coordinating heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers Containing Perfluoroalkyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have perfluorinated alkyl chains, where all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and can significantly reduce the electron density of the carboxyl group. This can impair the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst, leading to reduced yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide (–CONH–) linkages near the carboxylic acid group, especially when the amide connects the carboxyl group to an aromatic ring or another functional group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide bonds can alter the electronic properties of nearby functional groups and may hinder effective coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst. They can also introduce rigidity or steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Compound **23**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Ketone Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Influence Yield Based on Additional Substituents**

  - **Description**:
    - **Simple Ketone Acids**: Modifiers with ketone (–C=O) groups adjacent to carboxyl groups without additional electron-donating substituents result in **low yield**.
    - **Ketone Acids with Electron-Donating Groups**: Modifiers where the ketone group is adjacent to electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy-substituted aromatics) can result in **high yield**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ketone groups can interact with the catalyst, potentially inhibiting activity. However, electron-donating substituents can counteract this effect by enhancing electron density and facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Compound **27**)
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**)

  - **Prediction**: Yield is influenced by the presence of electron-donating groups near the ketone.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Short Aliphatic Chains Connecting Hydroxyphenyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where a hydroxyphenyl group is connected to the carboxyl group via a short aliphatic chain (e.g., three carbons).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Short aliphatic chains may not provide sufficient flexibility or optimal spacing for effective interaction with the catalyst. Steric hindrance between the hydroxyphenyl group and the catalyst can reduce yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Compound **30**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Highly Hydroxylated Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and provide additional sites for hydrogen bonding or coordination with the catalyst. This can increase the modifier's interaction with the catalyst surface, enhancing reactivity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Improve Para-Substituent Matching in Rule 1**

  The current code for Rule 1 attempts to identify para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids by manually calculating the para position within a ring. However, this approach may fail due to the complexity of ring systems and indexing issues. Instead, consider using RDKit's built-in functions to accurately identify para-substituted positions. Specifically, you can:

  - Use the `GetSubstructMatches` function with a SMARTS pattern that directly specifies a para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acid.
  - Define a SMARTS pattern for para-substitution, such as `[c]1cc([c])cc1[C](=O)[O;H1,H0-]`, where one substituent is at position 1 and the other at position 4.
  - Alternatively, utilize the `ChemicalFeatures` functionality to identify functional groups and their relative positions on the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Refine SMARTS Pattern for Aromatic Carboxylic Acids in Rule 1**

  The SMARTS pattern `[c][C](=O)[O;H1,H0-]` may not capture all aromatic carboxylic acids because it requires a specific atom order. Aromatic carboxylic acids can have different atom connectivity orders in SMILES strings. To improve matching:

  - Use a more general SMARTS pattern like `[$(cC(=O)[O;H1,H0-])]`, which matches any aromatic carbon connected to a carboxylic acid group.
  - Ensure that the pattern accounts for cases where the carboxyl group is written in different orders in the SMILES, such as `[C](=O)([O;H1,H0-])[c]`.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Implement All Rules in the Code**

  Currently, only Rules 1 and 2 are implemented in the `rules` list. To generate a complete feature matrix, you should implement all 15 rules as specified in the natural language description. For each rule:

  - Define the appropriate SMARTS patterns or combination of patterns.
  - Handle exceptions and special cases as noted in the rules.
  - Add each rule to the `rules` list with its number, description, patterns, and prediction.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Handle Exceptions Explicitly**

  Some rules include exceptions (e.g., Compound 12 in Rule 2). Ensure that the code explicitly checks for these exceptions by:

  - Defining SMARTS patterns for the exceptions.
  - Modifying the matching logic to exclude molecules that match the exception patterns, even if they match the general rule pattern.
  - Documenting the exceptions within the code for clarity.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Verify and Expand SMARTS Patterns for Heteroaromatic Rings in Rule 2**

  The SMARTS patterns for heteroaromatic rings in Rule 2 may not cover all relevant ring systems. To improve matching:

  - Include additional SMARTS patterns for other heteroaromatic rings mentioned in the rule, such as pyridinone, pyrazole, and benzofuran derivatives.
  - Use more general patterns when possible, such as `[nX2]` for heteroatoms in aromatic rings.
  - Test the patterns against known examples to ensure accurate matching.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Test SMARTS Patterns Against Known Examples**

  For each rule, validate the SMARTS patterns by testing them against the provided examples and known compounds. This will help ensure that:

  - The patterns accurately match compounds that should result in high or low yield.
  - No false positives or negatives occur due to pattern mismatches.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Include Logging and Debugging Statements**

  Add logging statements to the code to track which compounds match each rule. This can help identify where mismatches occur. For example:

  - Print the SMILES string and the rule number when a compound matches a rule.
  - Record unmatched compounds for further analysis.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Refine Pattern Matching Logic**

  The current matching logic may not account for all structural variations. To improve accuracy:

  - Use recursive SMARTS patterns to capture more complex structures.
  - Consider stereochemistry where relevant, using stereochemical SMARTS patterns.
  - Ensure patterns account for different resonance forms or tautomeric states.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Normalize Molecules Before Matching**

  Normalize the molecular structures before performing substructure searches by:

  - Using RDKit's `MolStandardize` module to standardize tautomers, protonation states, and aromaticity.
  - Removing salts or solvent molecules if present.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Improve Handling of Protonation States and Charges**

  Ensure that the SMARTS patterns account for different protonation states and charges, especially for functional groups like carboxylic acids, amines, and nitro groups. Adjust patterns to match:

  - Deprotonated carboxylates `[CX3](=O)[O-]`
  - Protonated amines `[NX3+;H3]`
  - Nitro groups in different representations `[N+](=O)[O-]` and `[N](=O)=O`

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

Upon examining the current rule metrics in comparison to the previous reference metrics, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current set of rules.

---

**1. Train Support**

- **Previous Metrics**: The average train support ranged between **0.1667** and **0.1845**.
- **Current Metrics**: The train support is **0.0**.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Significance**: Train support indicates the proportion of records where both the rule conditions and predictions are true.
  - **Analysis**: A train support of **0.0** implies that there are no records in the training data that satisfy both the conditions and predictions of the current rules. This suggests that the rules are either too specific, excluding all data points, or not correctly aligned with the dataset features.

---

**2. Train Confidence**

- **Previous Metrics**: The average train confidence was between **0.5396** and **0.6352**.
- **Current Metrics**: The train confidence is **0.5**.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Significance**: Train confidence measures the proportion of records with the specified rule conditions where the rule predictions are also true.
  - **Analysis**: A confidence of **0.5** indicates that the rule predictions are correct half the time when the rule conditions are met. This is lower than the previous average and suggests a decrease in the predictive power of the rules.

---

**3. Train Lift**

- **Previous Metrics**: The train lift values were between **1.0559** and **1.2048**.
- **Current Metrics**: The train lift is **1.0**.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Significance**: Lift compares the confidence of a rule to the overall likelihood of the prediction occurring by chance. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance.
  - **Analysis**: A lift of **1.0** means the rule does not improve upon random chance. This suggests that knowing the rule condition does not provide any advantage in predicting the outcome, indicating no association between the condition and the prediction.

---

**4. Train Leverage**

- **Previous Metrics**: The train leverage ranged from **-0.0041** to **0.0289**.
- **Current Metrics**: The train leverage is **0.0**.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Significance**: Leverage indicates the difference between the observed support and the expected support if the rule items were independent.
  - **Analysis**: A leverage of **0.0** suggests no association between the rule's condition and prediction beyond what would be expected by chance. This corroborates the findings from the lift metric.

---

**Overall Interpretation**

The current rules show a significant decline in performance metrics compared to the previous iterations:

- **Zero Train Support**: Indicates that the rules are not applicable to any instances in the training data.
- **Decreased Confidence**: A confidence score equal to a random guess (0.5) suggests that the rules are not reliably predicting outcomes when their conditions are met.
- **Lift at Unity**: Implies that the rules offer no improvement over random chance in predicting the outcome.
- **Zero Leverage**: Confirms the lack of any meaningful association captured by the rules.

These metrics collectively suggest that the current set of rules are not effectively capturing the relationships within the data necessary for accurate predictions.

---

**Assessment of Reaching a Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency**

The drastic drop in performance metrics indicates that the current rule set may represent a local minimum in the model's optimization process. Continuing with the current approach without significant changes is unlikely to yield improvements.

Given that:

- **Train Support** has reached zero, suggesting over-specification or misalignment.
- **Confidence** and **Lift** have not improved and are now at baseline levels.

It appears that the iterative process has reached a point where further minor adjustments are insufficient, and a reevaluation of the rules is necessary.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

1. **Reevaluate Rule Conditions**:
   - **Broaden Rule Applicability**: Relax overly strict conditions that may be excluding relevant data. Ensure that rule conditions are not too narrow.
   - **Align with Data Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of features in the dataset to adjust the rules according to actual data trends.

2. **Enhance Confidence and Lift**:
   - **Focus on High-Confidence Subsets**: Identify subsets of data where higher confidence and lift values can be achieved.
   - **Combine Complementary Conditions**: Merge conditions from different rules that individually have moderate confidence but together may yield higher confidence and lift.

3. **Incorporate Feature Importance**:
   - **Use Statistical Analysis**: Employ techniques such as correlation analysis or mutual information to identify features strongly associated with high yield.
   - **Prioritize Key Predictors**: Adjust the rules to emphasize features with the highest predictive power.

4. **Simplify Complex Rules**:
   - **Reduce Complexity**: Simplify rules to avoid overfitting and to improve generalization. Overly complex rules may not perform well on new data.
   - **Eliminate Redundancies**: Remove redundant or overlapping conditions that do not contribute to predictive performance.

5. **Increase Support**:
   - **Adjust Rule Thresholds**: Modify thresholds or criteria within the rules to increase the number of instances they cover.
   - **Ensure Relevance**: While increasing support, maintain relevance by ensuring that the rules still focus on meaningful relationships.

6. **Validate with Cross-Validation**:
   - **Use K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation to assess the rules' performance on different subsets of the data, ensuring robustness.
   - **Monitor Overfitting**: Check that improvements in training metrics translate to validation sets.

7. **Integrate Domain Expertise**:
   - **Consult Chemical Insights**: Leverage chemical knowledge to understand why certain modifiers affect yields and encode this understanding into the rules.
   - **Consider Mechanistic Factors**: Incorporate factors such as sterics, electronics, and coordination chemistry that may influence the catalytic activity.

8. **Explore New Rule Patterns**:
   - **Identify New Associations**: Investigate the data for unexplored patterns or relationships that could be translated into new rules.
   - **Use Data Mining Techniques**: Apply association rule learning algorithms to identify potential new rules.

9. **Address Exceptions and Anomalies**:
   - **Analyze Outliers**: Examine cases where the rules fail to predict accurately to understand any underlying causes.
   - **Revise Rules Accordingly**: Modify rules to account for exceptions or to exclude anomalies that adversely affect performance.

10. **Iterative Testing and Refinement**:
    - **Implement Incremental Changes**: Make systematic changes to the rules and observe their impact on the metrics.
    - **Document Iterations**: Keep detailed records of changes and results to inform future adjustments.

---

**Example of Rule Modification**

- **Current Rule with Zero Support**:

  *Rule 4*: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Issue**: Zero support suggests that no compounds in the dataset match this rule.

- **Suggested Revision**:

  - **Broaden the Chain Length**: Adjust the definition of "long-chain" to include medium-length chains if supported by the data.
  - **Include Additional Acceptable Functional Groups**: Allow for certain functional groups that do not negatively impact yield.

---

**Conclusion**

The current metrics indicate that the existing set of rules is not effectively predicting outcomes in the dataset. To improve performance:

- **Revisit and Revise Rules**: Modify the rules to better align with the data characteristics.
- **Focus on Confidence and Lift**: Aim to increase these metrics by creating rules that more accurately capture the relationships in the data.
- **Iterate Thoughtfully**: Make informed changes based on both data analysis and domain knowledge.

By undertaking these steps, we can develop rules that not only have higher support, confidence, and lift but also provide meaningful insights into the catalytic problem at hand.

ML Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Validation and Training Accuracies**

The current 5-fold validation accuracy is **42.86%**, which is significantly lower than the previous validation accuracies of approximately **76%**. This substantial decrease indicates that the current set of rules is not effectively capturing the underlying patterns in the data. The test accuracies in previous iterations ranged from **62.5% to 75%**, suggesting that the model previously had moderate predictive capabilities. The drop to **42.86%** suggests that the model's performance has deteriorated in the latest iteration.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

The significant decrease in validation accuracy implies potential **underfitting**. Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data. In this context, the current rules may be too generalized or not sufficiently capturing the critical features that distinguish between high and low modifier loadings on the catalyst. 

The SHAP analysis further supports this assessment. In the latest iteration, all the **Rule2 SHAP values are 0.0**, indicating that **Rule2 is not contributing to the model's predictions**. This lack of contribution suggests that the rule is either not applicable to any of the molecules in the dataset or is not effectively distinguishing between high and low loading modifiers.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into the contribution of each rule to the model's predictions for individual molecules. In previous iterations, both **Rule2** and **Rule3** had non-zero SHAP values, indicating their influence on the predictions. The presence of both positive and negative SHAP values suggests that these rules were contributing to both correct and incorrect predictions, providing opportunities for refinement.

In the latest iteration, the following observations are made:

- **Rule2 SHAP values are all 0.0**: This suggests that **Rule2 is ineffective in its current form**. It does not contribute to the prediction of high or low modifier loading, possibly due to misalignment with the features present in the molecules.

- **Consistent Prediction Discrepancies**: Many molecules have the **predicted loading mismatched with the experimental values**. For instance, molecules that experimentally have high loading are consistently predicted to have low loading, and vice versa.

- **Lack of Differentiation**: The model seems unable to differentiate between the molecules due to the lack of informative features extracted by the current rules.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

The drop in validation accuracy from approximately **76%** to **42.86%** suggests that the **current rules have reduced the model's predictive power**. The model may have reached a **local minimum**, where further iterations using the same approach do not yield improvements. The decrease in performance indicates that the current set of rules does not generalize well and may be overlooking important molecular features critical for accurate predictions.

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis**

The SHAP analysis reveals that **Rule2** is not providing any predictive value in the current model iteration. Since **Rule2 SHAP values are 0.0 across all molecules**, it indicates a need to **re-evaluate or refine this rule**. The lack of contribution suggests that either:

- The rule conditions are too strict, causing no molecules to satisfy the rule.
- The rule is too general, failing to capture specific features that contribute to high modifier loading.
- The rule does not align with the key chemical characteristics influencing the catalyst behavior.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results and using the previous metrics as a baseline, it is evident that the **current rules are not effective**. The significant decline in validation accuracy and the non-informative SHAP values point towards a model that is not capturing the essential features required for accurate predictions. The model appears to be **underfitting**, and the rules may not be adequately representing the complex relationships between molecular structures and modifier loading.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To address the issues identified, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Refine Rule2**:

   - **Analyze Rule2 Conditions**: Re-express or adjust the conditions in **Rule2** to better capture the characteristics of heteroaromatic carboxylic acids that lead to high yield. Ensure that the rule aligns with the molecular features present in the dataset.
   - **Incorporate Additional Functional Groups**: Consider expanding **Rule2** to include other heteroatoms or ring systems that may contribute to high modifier loading.

2. **Review and Adjust Other Rules**:

   - **Identify Overestimations and Underestimations**: Use the discrepancies between predicted and experimental values to pinpoint which rules contribute to misclassifications.
   - **Modify Rules with High Negative SHAP Values**: For molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, focus on rules that might be overly penalizing certain features.
   - **Revise Positive SHAP Value Rules**: For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, adjust rules that may be overemphasizing certain features.

3. **Enhance Feature Representation**:

   - **Introduce New Descriptors**: Incorporate additional molecular descriptors that capture relevant chemical properties, such as electronic effects, steric factors, and solubility.
   - **Utilize Substructure Patterns**: Identify common substructures in high-yield modifiers and include rules that detect these patterns.
   - **Apply Machine Learning Techniques**: Consider combining rule-based approaches with machine learning models that can learn complex patterns from the data.

4. **Avoid Overfitting and Underfitting**:

   - **Balance Rule Complexity**: Ensure that the rules are neither too general nor too specific. Overly general rules may fail to capture important distinctions, while overly specific rules may not generalize to new data.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Employ more robust cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

5. **Leverage SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement**:

   - **Iterative Rule Improvement**: Use SHAP values to iteratively refine the rules, focusing on those that contribute most to incorrect predictions.
   - **Domain Expertise Integration**: Collaborate with chemists to ensure that the rules are chemically sound and reflect true structure-activity relationships.

6. **Re-Evaluate Molecule Assignments**:

   - **Investigate Misclassified Molecules**: Analyze molecules that are consistently misclassified to identify any overlooked features or exceptions to the current rules.
   - **Update Exceptions in Rules**: Amend the rules to include exceptions or additional conditions based on new insights from misclassified cases.

7. **Improve Generalization**:

   - **Expand Training Data**: If possible, include more molecules in the training set to capture a wider variety of chemical structures.
   - **Regularization Techniques**: Implement regularization methods to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules is not adequately capturing the key features that determine modifier loading on the catalyst. By refining the existing rules, introducing new descriptors, and leveraging insights from SHAP analysis, the model's performance can be improved. A systematic approach that combines chemical intuition with data-driven techniques will enhance the rules' effectiveness and lead to more accurate predictions.

**Next Steps**

- **Organize a Team Review**: Collaborate with the research team to discuss these findings and prioritize rule adjustments.
- **Implement Refinements**: Apply the recommended changes to the rules and re-evaluate the model's performance.
- **Monitor Improvements**: Continuously track validation accuracy and SHAP values in subsequent iterations to ensure that refinements lead to tangible improvements.
- **Document Changes**: Keep detailed records of rule adjustments and their impacts on model performance for future reference.

By taking these steps, we can enhance the predictive capability of the model and contribute to the success of the research program focused on solving the catalytic problem.

**Summary and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The recent analysis of the rule-based model indicates that the current set of rules is not effectively predicting the yield outcomes for the remote δ-C(sp3)–H bond functionalization reaction. Several key observations support this conclusion:

1. **Performance Metrics Decline**:
   - **Zero Train Support**: The train support has dropped to **0.0**, indicating that none of the training data satisfies the conditions and predictions of the current rules.
   - **Low Train Confidence and Lift**: The train confidence is **0.5**, equivalent to random chance, and the train lift is **1.0**, suggesting no predictive advantage over random guessing.
   - **Zero Train Leverage**: A leverage of **0.0** confirms the lack of any meaningful association captured by the rules.

2. **Validation Accuracy Drop**:
   - The 5-fold validation accuracy has decreased to **42.86%**, significantly lower than previous accuracies of approximately **76%**.
   - This substantial decrease indicates **underfitting**, where the model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data.

3. **SHAP Analysis Findings**:
   - **Rule2 SHAP Values Zero**: All SHAP values for **Rule 2** are **0.0**, meaning this rule is not contributing to the model's predictions.
   - **Consistent Misclassifications**: The model is consistently predicting low modifier loading for molecules that experimentally have high loading and vice versa.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

To enhance the predictive performance of the model, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Implement All Rules in the Code**:
   - **Complete Rule Implementation**: Currently, only Rules 1 and 2 are implemented in the `rules` list. All 15 rules should be coded to capture the full range of influencing factors.
   - **Define Accurate SMARTS Patterns**: For each rule, develop precise SMARTS patterns that reflect the described features and test them against known examples.

2. **Revise Rule Matching Logic**:
   - **Improve Para-Substituent Matching in Rule 1**:
     - Use RDKit's built-in functions like `GetSubstructMatches` with SMARTS patterns designed for para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids.
     - Define SMARTS patterns for para-substitution, accurately capturing substituent positions on the aromatic ring.
   - **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Aromatic Carboxylic Acids**:
     - Use more general patterns to account for different atom connectivities in SMILES strings.
     - Ensure the patterns match all representations of aromatic carboxylic acids.

3. **Explicitly Handle Exceptions**:
   - **Incorporate Exceptions into Rules**:
     - For rules with noted exceptions, such as Rule 2's exception for Compound 12, adjust the code to exclude these cases.
     - Define SMARTS patterns specific to exceptions and modify the matching logic accordingly.

4. **Broaden and Refine Rule Conditions**:
   - **Adjust Overly Strict Conditions**:
     - Relax conditions that may be too narrow, excluding relevant data points.
     - For example, in Rule 4, consider broadening the chain length definition or including additional functional groups that do not negatively impact yield.

5. **Enhance Pattern Matching Techniques**:
   - **Utilize RDKit Functionalities**:
     - Leverage RDKit's functionalities to identify functional groups, stereochemistry, and relative positions more accurately.
   - **Account for Protonation States and Charges**:
     - Adjust SMARTS patterns to match different protonation states and charged species, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

6. **Normalize Molecules Before Matching**:
   - **Molecular Standardization**:
     - Use RDKit's `MolStandardize` module to normalize molecular representations, tautomers, and protonation states before substructure searches.

7. **Test and Validate SMARTS Patterns**:
   - **Verify Against Known Examples**:
     - Test each SMARTS pattern with known high and low yield modifiers to ensure accurate matching.
   - **Iterate Based on Feedback**:
     - Use mismatches and exceptions identified during testing to refine the SMARTS patterns.

8. **Add Logging and Debugging Statements**:
   - **Track Matching Results**:
     - Implement logging to record which compounds match each rule, aiding in identifying mismatches or errors.
   - **Analyze Unmatched Compounds**:
     - Investigate compounds that do not match any rules to identify potential new patterns or overlooked features.

9. **Utilize SHAP Analysis for Refinement**:
   - **Identify Key Contributors**:
     - Use SHAP values to understand which rules significantly influence predictions and focus on refining those rules.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for a straightforward determination of high yield when a modifier is an aromatic carboxylic acid substituted at the para position with electron-withdrawing or metal-coordinating groups. The underlying physical-chemical properties are adequately explained, highlighting increased acidity and enhanced metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring with specific substituents), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by multiple data points (Compounds 1, 4, 7, 21, 24) that all result in high yield, ensuring strong coverage. The balance between specificity and coverage is effectively achieved.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in specifying that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids lead to high yield due to metal coordination by heteroatoms. The physical-chemical insight is adequate. The rule involves combinations of sub-structures, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by several data points (Compounds 8, 16, 17, 22) with high yields. However, Compound 12 (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) results in low yield, contradicting the rule. This suggests the rule may not fully account for structural variations where the heteroaromatic ring is attached to another aromatic system. The rule could be refined to address such exceptions, improving its clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 effectively distinguishes between amino acids with aliphatic side chains (leading to high yield) and those with non-coordinating aromatic side chains (leading to low yield). The underlying physical-chemical properties are well-explained, emphasizing chelation and steric effects. The rule combines functional groups and side chain characteristics, satisfying the complexity requirement. It is supported by multiple data points for both high yield (Compounds 0, 2, 3, 15) and low yield (Compounds 13, 33), providing strong coverage. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly differentiates between aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal thiol groups (high yield) and aromatic thiol carboxylic acids (low yield). The physical-chemical rationale is sound, explaining differences in metal coordination. However, the rule is only supported by one data point for each case (Compounds 18 and 10), which is below the minimum coverage criterion. To strengthen the rule, additional supporting data points are needed. Currently, the rule lacks sufficient coverage to be considered robust.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and specifies that modifiers with multiple ether linkages result in low yield due to steric hindrance and altered environments. The physical-chemical insight is adequate. The rule considers combinations of functional groups (polyether chains), satisfying complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (Compounds 11 and 32) that result in low yield, meeting the coverage criterion. There are no contradictory data points, and the rule strikes a good balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield, supported by explanations of potential side reactions. The rule involves specific functional group arrangements, fulfilling the complexity requirement. It is backed by two data points (Compounds 19 and 20) showing low yield, satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule is well-balanced and adequately supported by the data.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 specifies that modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups lead to low yield, with reasonable physical-chemical explanations regarding their electronic and hydrophobic nature. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (Compound 14), which is insufficient for robust coverage. Additional examples are necessary to strengthen the rule's validity. Currently, the rule lacks sufficient evidence to be fully supported.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear in indicating that modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups lead to low yield, due to electronic and steric factors. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by two data points (Compounds 23 and 26) resulting in low yield, satisfying the coverage requirement. The rule maintains a good balance between specificity and generality.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly identifies that modifiers with remote functional groups on long aliphatic chains lead to low yield, with adequate explanations regarding ineffective catalyst interaction and steric effects. The rule involves combinations of chain length and functional group positioning, satisfying complexity. It is supported by three data points (Compounds 29, 31, 34) showing low yield, meeting the coverage criterion. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 specifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield, supported by physical-chemical insights on enhanced interactions and stability. The rule combines chain length and functional group multiplicity, satisfying complexity. It is supported by two data points (Compounds 6 and 9) resulting in high yield, fulfilling the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance between specificity and applicability.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing or Metal-Coordinating Groups at the Para Position Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para (4-) position with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) or metal-coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing interaction with metal centers in the catalyst. Metal-coordinating groups can form coordination bonds with the catalyst, stabilizing it and improving reactivity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Compound **24**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen or oxygen atoms capable of coordinating with metal centers. Examples include pyridine, pyrazole, and benzofuran rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic ring can coordinate with metal ions in the catalyst, enhancing stability and facilitating electron transfer processes. This coordination improves the overall catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Amino Acids with Aliphatic Side Chains Lead to High Yield; Those with Aromatic Side Chains Without Coordinating Heteroatoms Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**:
    - **High Yield**: Modifiers that are amino acids containing both an amino group (–NH₂) and one or more carboxylic acid groups (–COOH), with short aliphatic side chains (no aromatic rings or with heteroaromatic rings).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The amino and carboxyl groups in amino acids can chelate metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. Aliphatic side chains minimize steric hindrance. Aromatic side chains without coordinating sites may interfere with catalyst interaction.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)

  - **Prediction**:
    - **High Yield** for amino acids with aliphatic or coordinating heteroaromatic side chains.
    - **Low Yield** for amino acids with non-coordinating aromatic side chains.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Terminal Thiol Groups Lead to High Yield; Aromatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**:
    - **High Yield**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing a thiol (–SH) group at the terminal (ω) position of the carbon chain.
    - **Low Yield**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly attached to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aliphatic thiol groups can form favorable coordinate bonds with metal centers without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or irreversibly to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**)

  - **Prediction**:
    - **High Yield** for aliphatic thiol carboxylic acids.
    - **Low Yield** for aromatic thiol carboxylic acids.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Ether Linkages Result in Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing polyether chains with multiple ether (–O–) linkages in the backbone, such as oligoethylene glycol chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and steric bulk, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst's active sites. They may also alter the local environment unfavorably for catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Attached to Aromatic Rings Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the aromatic ring, particularly at positions ortho or para to the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are electrophilic and can undergo side reactions, such as forming Schiff bases with amino groups. This may deactivate the catalyst or divert reactants, reducing overall yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers Containing Perfluoroalkyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have perfluorinated alkyl chains, where all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which may reduce the modifier's ability to interact with the catalyst and can disrupt catalyst solubility or electronic properties.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide (–CONH–) linkages near the carboxylic acid group, especially when the amide connects the carboxyl group to an aromatic ring or another functional group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide bonds can alter the electronic properties of nearby functional groups and may hinder effective coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. They can introduce rigidity or steric hindrance, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Compound **23**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Remote Functional Groups (Amino or Hydroxyl) on Long Aliphatic Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths longer than six carbons and contain amino (–NH₂) or hydroxyl (–OH) groups located away from the carboxyl group (e.g., at the ω-position).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Functional groups remote from the carboxyl group may not effectively interact with the catalyst's active sites. Additionally, longer carbon chains can introduce steric hindrance and reduce catalyst efficiency due to increased flexibility and entropy.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups along a short carbon chain (up to six carbons).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide additional sites for hydrogen bonding or coordination with the catalyst. This can enhance the modifier's interaction with the catalyst surface, improving stability and reactivity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

- **Suggestion 1**: **Refine Rule 1 SMARTS Patterns to Specify Para Substitution**

  - *Issue*: The current SMARTS patterns for Rule 1 do not enforce the substitution at the para (4-) position on the aromatic ring, nor do they specifically check for electron-withdrawing or metal-coordinating groups at that position.
  
  - *Improvement*: Modify the SMARTS patterns to specifically detect para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with appropriate substituents. An example SMARTS pattern for para substitution is:

    ```
    [c:1]1[cH][cH][c:2][cH][cH]1C(=O)O.[c:1][c:2][$(N),$(O),$(F),$(Cl),$(Br),$(I),$(C(=O)O),$(C=O)]
    ```
    
    This pattern ensures that the aromatic ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4 (para to each other), with one being a carboxylic acid and the other an electron-withdrawing or metal-coordinating group. Update the code to include this pattern and test it against known examples to ensure correct matching.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Expand Rule 2 Patterns to Include Diverse Heteroaromatic Rings**

  - *Issue*: The current pattern `[n,o,s]1cccc1` may not capture all relevant heteroaromatic carboxylic acids, as it only detects five-membered rings with one heteroatom.
  
  - *Improvement*: Use more inclusive SMARTS patterns that cover a variety of heteroaromatic rings, such as pyridine, pyrazole, and benzofuran. For example:

    ```
    [n,o,s]1cccc1C(=O)O
    [c][n,o,s][c][c][c][c]C(=O)O
    ```
    
    Incorporate multiple patterns or a recursive SMARTS pattern that matches heteroaromatic systems attached to a carboxylic acid. This will improve the detection of modifiers described in Rule 2.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Adjust Rule 3 to Accurately Differentiate Side Chains**

  - *Issue*: The code for Rule 3 does not accurately distinguish between amino acids with aliphatic side chains (high yield) and those with aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms (low yield).
  
  - *Improvement*:

    - For **Rule 3 High**:

      - Modify the pattern to match amino acids with aliphatic or coordinating heteroaromatic side chains. The pattern should detect amino acids and exclude those with non-coordinating aromatic side chains. An example pattern is:

        ```
        [NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[O;H1,H0-])[CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[O;H1,H0-]
        ```
        
        This pattern targets amino acids with aliphatic side chains by ensuring that the side chain carbons are sp³ hybridized and not part of an aromatic system.
      
    - For **Rule 3 Low**:

      - Adjust the pattern to specifically match amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms. For example:

        ```
        [NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[O;H1,H0-])[CX4][cH]
        ```
        
        This pattern detects amino acids where the side chain includes an aromatic ring without coordinating heteroatoms. Ensure that heteroaromatic rings with coordinating atoms are excluded from this low-yield prediction.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Differentiate Aromatic and Aliphatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids in Rule 4**

  - *Issue*: The current SMARTS patterns may not effectively distinguish between aliphatic and aromatic thiol carboxylic acids.
  
  - *Improvement*:

    - For **Rule 4 High**:

      - Use a pattern that matches aliphatic chains terminating with a thiol and a carboxylic acid group. An example pattern is:

        ```
        [CX4][CX4][CX4;!R][SX2H]C(=O)[O;H1,H0-]
        ```
        
        This ensures the thiol is at the terminal position of an aliphatic chain and not part of a ring.
      
    - For **Rule 4 Low**:

      - Use a pattern that captures aromatic rings with thiol groups directly attached. For example:

        ```
        [c][SX2H]C(=O)[O;H1,H0-]
        ```
        
        This pattern matches aromatic thiol carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Improve Detection of Polyether Chains in Rule 5**

  - *Issue*: The pattern `[#6][OX2][#6][OX2][#6]` may miss modifiers with longer polyether chains or branching.
  
  - *Improvement*: Use a recursive SMARTS or repetition in the pattern to detect multiple ether linkages regardless of length or branching:

    ```
    [#6]([OX2][#6]){$([OX2][#6])}[$([OX2][#6])]
    ```
    
    Alternatively, use the pattern:

    ```
    [#6](O[#6]){$(O[#6])}[$(O[#6])]
    ```
    
    This matches modifiers containing three or more consecutive ether linkages.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Refine Rule 6 Pattern to Match Aromatic Aldehydes Correctly**

  - *Issue*: The pattern `[c][CX3H1](=O)` may incorrectly match aldehydes at any position on the aromatic ring, not specifically ortho or para to the carboxyl group.
  
  - *Improvement*: Modify the pattern to detect aldehyde groups at positions ortho or para to the carboxyl group. For example:

    ```
    c1cc([C](=O)O)ccc1[C](=O)  (para position)
    c1c([C](=O)O)cc(C=O)cc1   (ortho position)
    ```
    
    Develop SMARTS patterns that explicitly consider the relative positions of substituents on the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Ensure Rule 7 Accurately Identifies Perfluoroalkyl Groups**

  - *Issue*: The current pattern `[CX4](F)(F)(F)` may only detect trifluoromethyl groups, not longer perfluoroalkyl chains.
  
  - *Improvement*: Use a more general pattern that identifies longer perfluoroalkyl chains:

    ```
    [CX4](F)(F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)...  (repeating as necessary)
    ```
    
    Or use recursive SMARTS to match carbon chains fully substituted with fluorines:

    ```
    [CX4;R0][F][F][F][F]
    ```
    
    This will detect modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains of various lengths.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Incorporate Chain Length and Hydroxyl Count in Rule 10**

  - *Issue*: Rule 10's implementation may not correctly enforce the chain length limit and may include aromatic compounds.
  
  - *Improvement*: Modify the code to:

    - Count the number of hydroxyl groups on aliphatic (non-aromatic) carbons.
    - Ensure the carbon chain length is six or fewer carbons.
    - Exclude molecules containing aromatic rings.
    
    An example code snippet:

    ```python
    if not mol.HasSubstructMatch(Chem.MolFromSmarts('[a]')):
        chain_lengths = [len(chain) for chain in Chem.FindAllPathsOfLengthN(mol, 6)]
        if any(chain_lengths):
            hydroxyl_matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts('[C;!R][OX2H]'))
            if len(hydroxyl_matches) >= 2:
                # Rule 10 matches
    ```

    This ensures that only short aliphatic chains with multiple hydroxyl groups are considered.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Generalize Functional Group Definitions**

  - **Action**: Redefine the rules to focus on the presence or absence of key functional groups and structural motifs that can be directly identified from SMILES strings. Instead of specifying positions like "para position," use more general terms such as "aromatic ring with an electron-withdrawing group."
  - **Benefit**: This simplification enables easier parsing and feature extraction from SMILES, facilitating the generation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Develop SMARTS Patterns for Key Functional Groups**

  - **Action**: Create a library of SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns corresponding to important functional groups and substructures identified in the rules (e.g., carboxylic acids, nitro groups, thiol groups, amino acids).
  - **Benefit**: SMARTS patterns allow for automated and accurate detection of specific molecular features within SMILES strings, streamlining the feature extraction process.

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify Features Using Binary and Count Variables**

  - **Action**: For each modifier, assign binary variables (1 or 0) indicating the presence or absence of specific functional groups (e.g., has_carboxylic_acid, has_nitro_group) and count variables for the number of such groups (e.g., num_thiol_groups).
  - **Benefit**: Binary and count variables are straightforward to include in a numeric feature matrix and are easily derived from SMILES representations.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors Computable from SMILES**

  - **Action**: Use cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit) to calculate molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), number of rotatable bonds, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and aromatic ring count.
  - **Benefit**: These descriptors provide quantitative features that capture the physical and chemical properties of the modifiers, enhancing the predictive power of the model.

- **Advice 5**: **Replace Position-Specific Rules with Functional Equivalents**

  - **Action**: Substitute rules that rely on specific positions (e.g., "para-substituted") with features that reflect the electronic or steric effects, such as "presence of electron-withdrawing group on aromatic ring."
  - **Benefit**: Position-specific information is challenging to extract from SMILES, whereas functional effects can be approximated by the types of substituents present.

- **Advice 6**: **Eliminate Ambiguity by Defining Clear Feature Criteria**

  - **Action**: Clearly define what constitutes electron-withdrawing groups, metal-coordinating groups, or hydrophobic groups by listing specific functional groups or using quantitative scales (e.g., Hammett sigma values).
  - **Benefit**: Removes subjectivity and ensures consistent feature extraction across different modifiers.

- **Advice 7**: **Create a Standardized Feature Extraction Workflow**

  - **Action**: Develop a systematic method to parse SMILES strings and extract features based on the revised rules, possibly through scripting or utilizing existing cheminformatics libraries.
  - **Benefit**: Ensures that feature extraction is reproducible, efficient, and applicable to new modifiers in the future.

- **Advice 8**: **Consider Structural Fragment Contributions**

  - **Action**: Break down modifiers into common structural fragments (e.g., aliphatic chains, aromatic rings, heterocycles) and represent these fragments as features.
  - **Benefit**: Captures the influence of different molecular scaffolds on the yield and simplifies the complexity of molecular structures.

- **Advice 9**: **Reclassify Complex Functionalities into Composite Features**

  - **Action**: For modifiers with multiple interacting functional groups (e.g., amino acids with side chains), create composite features that represent the combined effect (e.g., aliphatic_amino_acid, aromatic_amino_acid).
  - **Benefit**: Reduces dimensionality and complexity in the feature matrix while preserving important chemical information.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Rules Using Statistical Methods**

  - **Action**: Use statistical analysis or machine learning techniques to test the correlation between extracted features and yield outcomes, refining rules based on empirical data.
  - **Benefit**: Enhances the robustness and predictive accuracy of the rules by grounding them in quantitative analysis.

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of six or more carbons and containing polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) positioned away from the carboxyl group (such as at the ω-position).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Remote polar groups do not effectively interact with the catalyst's active sites. The long carbon chains introduce steric hindrance and increase molecular flexibility, which can decrease the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Multiple Ether Linkages Result in Low Yield**

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Compound **23**)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers Containing Perfluoroalkyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have perfluorinated alkyl chains, where hydrogen atoms are fully substituted with fluorine atoms.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluoroalkyl groups are extremely electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can impede interaction with the catalyst. They may also destabilize the catalyst by withdrawing electron density from coordinating sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Coordinating Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield; Those Without Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids with aromatic side chains that include heteroatoms capable of coordinating with the catalyst (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms can enhance coordination with the catalyst, while those without may cause steric hindrance without contributing to catalyst interaction.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)

    - **High Yield** for amino acids with coordinating heteroaromatic side chains.
    - **Low Yield** for amino acids with non-coordinating aromatic side chains.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Sulfanyl (Thiol) Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol (–SH) groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups are good ligands for metal centers due to their lone pair electrons on sulfur. In short chains, they can effectively coordinate with the catalyst without causing significant steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Attached to the Ring Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly connected to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst by forming irreversible complexes or causing aggregation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups along the chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility in polar solvents and provide additional coordination sites for the catalyst. They can form hydrogen bonds and stabilize the catalyst-modifier complex.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Ketone Groups Adjacent to Aromatic Rings Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have a ketone (–C=O) group connected to an aliphatic chain adjacent to an aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ketone groups can participate in coordination with metal centers through their lone pairs on oxygen. When adjacent to aromatic rings, they may facilitate electron delocalization and stabilize the catalytic intermediate.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Electron-Donating Methoxy Groups on Aromatic Rings Lead to High Yield if Accompanied by Coordinating Functionalities**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy (–OCH₃) groups on the ring, especially when combined with other coordinating functional groups such as ketones or additional carboxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Methoxy groups are electron-donating and can enhance electron density on the aromatic ring, potentially improving π-interactions with the catalyst. When combined with coordinating groups, they can synergistically enhance catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Acidic Hydrogen Adjacent to Electron-Deficient Rings Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing acidic hydrogen atoms (e.g., in enolizable positions) next to electron-deficient heteroaromatic rings or conjugated carbonyl systems.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of acidic hydrogens can facilitate hydrogen bonding and stabilize reactive intermediates. Electron-deficient rings can accept electron density, enhancing coordination with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify Rules Using Structural Descriptors Extracted from SMILES**

  - **Explanation**: Modify the existing rules to focus on specific, quantifiable structural features that can be directly identified from SMILES strings. By using clear, measurable criteria (e.g., functional group counts, presence of specific substructures), the rules become more practical for computational analysis and feature generation.

  - **Implementation**:
    - Define rules based on the presence or absence of specific substructures or functional groups identifiable in SMILES.
    - Use pattern matching or substructure searching within SMILES to detect these features.
    - Example: Instead of "Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position," specify "Modifiers with a nitro group (`[N+](=O)[O-]`) attached to a benzene ring at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group."

- **Advice 2**: **Develop a Numeric Feature Matrix Based on Molecular Descriptors**

  - **Explanation**: Generate a comprehensive set of molecular descriptors for each modifier directly from their SMILES representations. This includes topological, electronic, and steric properties that can be quantified and used in statistical or machine learning models.

  - **Implementation**:
    - Utilize cheminformatics tools like RDKit to compute descriptors such as:
      - Functional group counts (e.g., number of carboxylic acids, amines, hydroxyl groups).
      - Structural features (e.g., ring count, heteroatom presence, aliphatic chain length).
      - Physicochemical properties (e.g., molecular weight, LogP, polar surface area).
    - Create a numerical feature matrix where each row represents a modifier and each column represents a descriptor value.

    - Review each modifier in the dataset and assign it to a single rule based on the new quantifiable criteria.
    - Adjust rules so they cover all observed cases without redundancy.
    - Update rules to fill any gaps where modifiers do not fit existing categories.

- **Advice 9**: **Include SMILES Examples for Each Rule**

  - **Explanation**: Provide SMILES representations of example compounds for each rule to illustrate how the structural criteria relate to the SMILES notation. This aids in automated parsing and feature extraction.

  - **Implementation**:
    - List SMILES strings alongside compound names in the examples.
    - Use these SMILES in documentation and when programming feature extraction algorithms.

- **Advice 10**: **Leverage Machine Learning to Refine Rules**

  - **Explanation**: Use statistical models and machine learning techniques to discover patterns in the data that may not be evident from qualitative analysis alone, leading to improved or new rules.

  - **Implementation**:
    - Apply feature selection methods to the numerical feature matrix to identify descriptors most correlated with yield.
    - Use classification algorithms to model the relationship between features and yield, which can inform rule adjustments.
    - Incorporate insights from the models to refine or create rules based on statistically significant features.

  - **Rule 7** is clear in specifying that amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight is plausible, explaining steric hindrance without coordination benefits. The rule combines multiple substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by a single example (Compound **13**), which falls short of the coverage criterion. Additional data points would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 8**:

  - **Rule 8** clearly states that amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms lead to high yield. The physical-chemical reasoning is sound, highlighting the role of heteroatoms in enhancing coordination. The complexity is appropriate, and the rule is supported by one data point (Compound **15**), which is insufficient for the coverage criterion. More examples are needed to reinforce this rule.

- **Comment 9**:

  - **Rule 9** identifies short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups as leading to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, emphasizing strong ligand properties of thiol groups. Supported by one data point (Compound **18**), the rule does not meet the coverage criterion. The rule is clear but would benefit from additional supporting data.

- **Comment 10**:

  - **Rule 10** specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups attached directly to the ring lead to low yield. The physical-chemical explanation is plausible, discussing over-coordination and potential catalyst deactivation. However, it is supported by a single data point (Compound **10**), failing to meet the coverage criterion. The rule is clear but requires more data for robustness.

- **Comment 11**:

  - **Rule 11** indicates that aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) lead to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound, addressing increased coordination sites and solubility. It is supported by two data points (Compounds **6** and **9**), satisfying the coverage requirement. The rule has appropriate complexity and balance.

- **Comment 12**:

  - **Rule 12** identifies modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains as leading to low yield. The physical-chemical reasoning is acceptable, noting unfavorable electronic interactions and hydrophobicity. Supported by one data point (Compound **14**), it does not meet the coverage criterion. The rule is clear but lacks sufficient data support.

- **Comment 13**:

  - **Rule 13** states that modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings lead to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, discussing coordination via ketone groups. It is supported by two data points (Compounds **17** and **25**), meeting the coverage criterion. The rule has the appropriate level of complexity and balance.

- **Comment 14**:

  - **Rule 14** specifies that modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups lead to low yield. The physical-chemical explanation is plausible, highlighting altered electronic properties and steric hindrance. Supported by two data points (Compounds **26** and **33**), it satisfies the coverage requirement. The rule is clear and balanced.

- **Comment 15**:

  - **Rule 15** clarifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids with aromatic rings connected via long chains lead to high yield. The physical-chemical reasoning is adequate, discussing reduced steric hindrance and electron delocalization. Supported by two data points (Compounds **7** and **24**), it meets the coverage criterion. The rule has appropriate complexity and balance.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids with Amino and Carboxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with short aliphatic side chains (up to five carbons) containing both amino groups (–NH₂) and carboxylic acid groups (–COOH), without aromatic rings or bulky substituents.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. The short aliphatic chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating access to active sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Strong Electron-Withdrawing Groups at the Para Position (Excluding Aldehydes) Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para (4-) position with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (–NO₂), amino (–NH₂), or bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), but not aldehyde groups (–CHO).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, promoting higher yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**)

  - **Exception**:
    - Modifiers with aldehyde groups at the para position, such as **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**), will result in **low yield**.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Heterocycles Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings, such as pyridine, pyrazole, or pyridone rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen heteroatoms in the aromatic ring can coordinate with metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and facilitating electron transfer. This interaction boosts catalytic efficiency and leads to higher yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Polar Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbon atoms and no additional polar functional groups beyond the terminal carboxylic acid.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The simple structure minimizes steric hindrance and allows effective interaction with the catalyst's active sites. The hydrophobic chain can enhance substrate-catalyst interactions in non-polar environments.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Terminal Polar Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are long-chain (six or more carbons) aliphatic carboxylic acids containing additional polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) at the terminal end of the chain opposite the carboxylic acid.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The terminal polar groups can introduce steric hindrance and disrupt effective coordination with the catalyst. They may also increase the flexibility of the molecule, reducing the precision of interactions with active sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers Containing Multiple Ether Linkages (Polyethers) Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have polyether chains with multiple ether (–O–) linkages within the molecule.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of multiple ether linkages increases molecular flexibility and size, which can cause steric hindrance. Ether oxygen atoms may also interact unfavorably with the catalyst, disrupting coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Lacking Coordinating Heteroatoms Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains that do not contain heteroatoms capable of coordination, such as phenylalanine.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms may introduce steric hindrance without providing benefits of additional coordination. This can hinder effective catalyst-modifier interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Coordinating Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination, such as the indole ring in tryptophan.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. This additional coordination can lead to improved yields.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol (–SH) groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups are strong ligands for metal ions due to the high polarizability of sulfur atoms. They enhance coordination with the catalyst's metal centers without introducing significant steric hindrance.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Attached Directly to the Ring Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly connected to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings may bind too strongly to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst or causing aggregation. This can reduce the efficiency of the reaction.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 11**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups (Polyols) Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can serve as additional coordination sites for the catalyst, enhancing interaction and stability. They also increase the solubility of the modifier, improving reaction efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers Containing Perfluoroalkyl Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains where hydrogen atoms are fully substituted with fluorine atoms.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. They may also destabilize the catalyst-modifier complex due to unfavorable electronic interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Ketone Groups Adjacent to Aromatic Rings Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone (–C=O) groups connected to the aromatic ring, possibly with additional methoxy substituents.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ketone groups adjacent to aromatic systems can participate in coordination with metal centers. Methoxy groups may enhance electron delocalization, facilitating interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain amide (–CONH–) linkages near the carboxylic acid group, especially when connected to aromatic rings or additional functional groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide bonds can alter the electronic properties of adjacent carboxyl groups, reducing their ability to coordinate with metal centers. The rigidity of the amide linkage may also introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Aromatic Rings Connected via Long Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with aromatic rings attached through aliphatic chains of four or more carbons. The aromatic ring may contain additional substituents like hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Longer aliphatic chains reduce steric hindrance from the aromatic ring, allowing effective interaction with the catalyst. The aromatic ring may also facilitate electron delocalization, enhancing reactivity.

  - **Example**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Compound **24**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise the Chain Length Calculation in Rule 1**  
  The current implementation of Rule 1 uses `max_chain_length` and attempts to identify carbon chains with the SMARTS pattern `[CX4;!$(C([OX2H,O-])[OX2H,O-])]`. This pattern might not accurately represent the side chain length of amino acids and could include or exclude unintended atoms. To improve accuracy:
  - Redefine the chain length calculation to specifically measure the length of the side chain attached to the α-carbon of the amino acid.
  - Use more precise SMARTS patterns that account for the α-amino and α-carboxyl groups and measure the side chain excluding these groups.
  - Ensure the pattern excludes aromatic rings and bulky substituents as per the natural language rule.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Enhance Exclusion of Aldehyde Groups in Rule 2**  
  Rule 2 aims to exclude modifiers with aldehyde groups at the para position. The current `exclude_patterns` uses `Chem.MolFromSmarts('C=O')`, which may not specifically target aldehyde groups at the para position of aromatic rings. To address this:
  - Update the exclusion pattern to specifically match aldehyde groups attached to an aromatic ring at the para position. For example, use the SMARTS pattern `[$([c][CH]=O)]` to identify aldehyde groups on aromatic carbons.
  - Incorporate positional specificity to ensure only para substitutions are considered. This may involve mapping the positions on the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Specify Terminal Polar Groups in Rule 5**  
  The current implementation of Rule 5 may not accurately identify polar groups at the terminal end opposite the carboxylic acid. To improve specificity:
  - Modify the SMARTS patterns to target polar groups (e.g., amino `[NX3;H2,H1]`, hydroxyl `[OX2H]`) specifically at the terminal carbon of the aliphatic chain.
  - Use SMARTS patterns that recognize the entire aliphatic chain and verify the presence of polar groups at the correct position.
  - Ensure that the chain is sufficiently long (six or more carbons) and that the polar group is indeed on the terminal carbon.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Correct the Counting of Ether Linkages in Rule 6**  
  The current code uses `'match_count': {'ether_linkage': 2}` to check for multiple ether linkages but may not correctly count them due to how RDKit handles substructure matches. To fix this:
  - Iterate over the matches of the `ether_linkage` pattern and count the unique occurrences.
  - Make sure that overlapping matches are accounted for and that the count accurately reflects the number of ether linkages.
  - Consider using a recursive SMARTS pattern or a more specific pattern that captures polyether chains.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Refine Amide Group Identification in Rule 14**  
  The SMARTS pattern for `amide_group` (`'[NX3][CX3](=O)[#6]'`) may not capture all amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups or may include unintended matches. To improve this:
  - Enhance the SMARTS pattern to ensure it only matches amide groups adjacent to carboxyl groups. For example, incorporate the carboxyl group into the pattern: `'[CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.
  - Ensure that the amide bond is directly connected to the carboxyl group without intervening atoms.
  - Test the pattern against known compounds to validate its accuracy.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Add Validation with Test Cases for Each Rule**  
  Incorporate specific examples and counter-examples for each rule to verify that the SMARTS patterns and code logic are functioning as intended. This can be done by:
  - Creating unit tests using the example compounds provided in the natural language rules.
  - Checking that each rule correctly assigns `1`, `-1`, or `0` to these examples.
  - Adjusting the SMARTS patterns and code logic based on the test results to improve accuracy.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Improve Handling of Chain Length and Connectivity**  
  In several rules, accurate identification of chain length and specific connectivity is crucial (e.g., Rules 1, 4, 5, and 15). To enhance this:
  - Utilize RDKit's graph functionalities to calculate the exact number of atoms between functional groups.
  - Implement functions that trace paths between atoms of interest (e.g., from the carboxyl group to the terminal polar group) and measure the path length.
  - Ensure branched chains are handled appropriately according to the rules' requirements.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Explicitly Define Substituent Positions on Aromatic Rings**  
  For rules involving substitutions at specific positions on aromatic rings (e.g., Rule 2 and Rule 10), positional specificity is essential. To achieve this:
  - Use RDKit's `Mol.GetSubstructMatches()` with atom mapping to identify substituents at ortho, meta, or para positions.
  - Define SMARTS patterns that encode the relative positions of substituents on the ring.
  - Consider the ring's symmetry and the potential for multiple equivalent positions.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics:**

Upon examining the current rule metrics in comparison to the previous iterations, several observations can be made, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**:

1. **Train Confidence Improvement**:
   - **Previous Train Confidence**: The mean train confidences from previous iterations were **63.52%** and **53.96%**.
   - **Current Train Confidence**: The current train confidence has increased to **73.18%**.
   - **Interpretation**: This significant increase indicates that the current rules are more accurate in predicting high yields within the training dataset. A higher confidence means that when the rule's conditions are met, the predicted outcome (high yield) is more likely to be correct.

2. **Train Lift Enhancement**:
   - **Previous Train Lift**: The mean train lifts were **1.20** and **1.06**.
   - **Current Train Lift**: The current train lift has improved to **1.47**.
   - **Interpretation**: Since lift measures how much better the rule is at predicting the outcome than random chance, an increase suggests that the rules are more effective in identifying modifiers that lead to high yield. A lift significantly greater than 1 indicates a strong positive association between the rule conditions and the high yield outcome.

3. **Train Support Reduction**:
   - **Previous Train Support**: The previous supports were **16.67%** and **18.45%**.
   - **Current Train Support**: The current train support has decreased to **6.86%**.
   - **Interpretation**: The support indicates the proportion of data that the rules apply to. A reduction suggests that while the rules are more accurate (higher confidence), they cover a smaller portion of the dataset. This might mean that the rules are too specialized and may not capture all relevant cases.

**Assessment of Current Rules:**

- **Improved Predictive Accuracy**: The increase in confidence and lift highlights that the current rules have become more reliable in predicting high yield when their conditions are met.

- **Decreased Coverage**: The reduced support indicates that the rules are now applicable to fewer instances. This could be a result of the rules becoming too specific, possibly due to overfitting to the training data.

- **Balance Between Specificity and Generality**: The high confidence and lift suggest specificity, while the low support points to a need for generality. Striking a balance is crucial to ensure that the rules are both accurate and broadly applicable.

**Determination of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

- **Local Minimum**: The improvements in confidence and lift, along with the decrease in support, may suggest that the current rule set is approaching a local minimum. This is characterized by minimal gains in performance despite further iterations, often accompanied by overfitting.

- **Sufficiency of Iterations**: Given that the metrics have improved but with diminishing returns in coverage, it may be an indication that the model has undergone enough iterations. However, without test metrics from the current iteration, it's challenging to conclusively determine if a local minimum has been reached.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Expand Rule Coverage**:
   - **Action**: Review and adjust the existing rules to cover more data points without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
   - **Rationale**: Increasing support will enhance the applicability of the rules across a broader range of modifiers.

2. **Simplify Overly Specific Rules**:
   - **Action**: Identify rules that are too detailed and consider generalizing their conditions.
   - **Rationale**: Overly specific rules might capture noise instead of meaningful patterns, leading to overfitting.

3. **Incorporate Validation Metrics**:
   - **Action**: Apply the current rules to a validation or test set to obtain test metrics.
   - **Rationale**: Evaluating the rules on unseen data helps in assessing their generalization capability and detecting overfitting.

4. **Feature Analysis**:
   - **Action**: Perform a feature importance analysis to identify which molecular features most strongly influence yield.
   - **Rationale**: Understanding key features can guide the refinement of rules to focus on the most impactful properties.

5. **Rule Pruning and Optimization**:
   - **Action**: Remove or adjust rules that contribute minimally to confidence and lift or those that significantly reduce support.
   - **Rationale**: Streamlining the rule set can prevent complexity without sacrificing performance.

6. **Iterative Testing**:
   - **Action**: Continue iterative testing with adjustments based on validation feedback.
   - **Rationale**: This allows for continuous improvement and convergence towards optimal rules.

7. **Domain Expertise Consultation**:
   - **Action**: Discuss the rules with chemists or domain experts to ensure that they make scientific sense.
   - **Rationale**: Expert insights can validate the plausibility of rules and provide guidance on potential modifications.

8. **Balance Confidence and Support**:
   - **Action**: Seek a balance where both confidence and support are optimized.
   - **Rationale**: High confidence is valuable, but not if the rules apply to an insignificant portion of the data.

**Conclusion:**

The current rules demonstrate enhanced predictive accuracy within the training dataset, as evidenced by higher confidence and lift. However, the decrease in support suggests that the rules may be too narrowly focused, potentially limiting their usefulness. To improve the current rules:

- **Adjust the balance between specificity and generality** to increase their applicability without sacrificing too much accuracy.
- **Incorporate validation data metrics** to assess and improve generalization to unseen data.
- **Iteratively refine the rules** using feedback from both data metrics and domain expertise.

By addressing these aspects, we can develop a robust set of rules that not only perform well on training data but also generalize effectively, thereby optimizing the catalytic process under study.

**Analysis of Model Performance and Recommendations for Improvement**

---

### **1. Evaluation of Current Model Performance**

**Latest Validation Accuracy**: The current 5-fold validation accuracy is **62.86%**, as per the latest model iteration.

**Comparison with Reference Metrics**: Previous reference validation accuracies were consistently around **76%**, with test accuracies of **75%** and **62.5%**. The current validation accuracy is notably lower than the reference, indicating a decline in model performance.

**Interpretation**:

- The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules is less effective than previous iterations.
- The model's predictive capability has diminished, indicating potential issues with the current rule set or model configuration.

---

### **2. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

**Underfitting Concern**:

- The significant reliance on **Rule 14** in the SHAP analysis, with minimal contribution from other rules, suggests that the model may be **underfitting** the data.
- Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both training and validation datasets.

**Overfitting Observation**:

- If the model were overfitting, we would expect high training accuracy but low validation accuracy. However, the validation accuracy is low, and there's no mention of training accuracy being substantially higher.
- The focus on a single rule indicates a lack of model complexity rather than overfitting.

---

### **3. Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

**SHAP Analysis Overview**:

- **Rule 14** is the predominant rule influencing model predictions.
- Positive SHAP values contribute to predicting **high loading**, while negative values contribute to **low loading**.

**Discrepancies Identified**:

1. **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low)**:

   - **Molecule**: C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
     - **Predicted Loading**: High
     - **Experimental Loading**: Low

  - **Refine Chain Length Calculation**: Use precise SMARTS patterns to measure the side chain length, excluding the α-amino and α-carboxyl groups. For example, focus on the side chain attached to the α-carbon.

  - **Exclude Aromatic Rings**: Ensure that the pattern excludes compounds with aromatic rings or bulky substituents.

- **Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with EWG at Para Position)**:

  - **Improve Exclusion of Aldehyde Groups**: Update the exclusion pattern to specifically match aldehyde groups at the para position on aromatic rings using SMARTS like `'[cH]C(=O)'`.

  - **Specify Positional Specificity**: Ensure that the electron-withdrawing groups are at the para position by mapping the positions on the aromatic ring.

- **Rule 5 (Long-Chain Aliphatic Acids with Terminal Polar Groups)**:

  - **Specify Terminal Polar Groups**: Modify SMARTS patterns to target polar groups (e.g., amino `[NH2]`, hydroxyl `[OH]`) specifically at the terminal carbon opposite the carboxylic acid.

  - **Ensure Correct Chain Length**: Confirm that the chain has six or more carbons and the polar group is on the terminal carbon.

- **Rule 6 (Polyethers Leading to Low Yield)**:

  - **Correct Ether Linkage Counting**: Accurately count the number of ether linkages by iterating over the matches of the ether pattern and counting unique occurrences.

  - **Use Specific Patterns**: Consider using patterns that capture polyether chains, such as `'-OCCO-'` repeated units.

**c. Balance Rule Contributions**

- **Prevent Single Rule Dominance**: Adjust the model to prevent over-reliance on Rule 14 by ensuring other rules contribute effectively to predictions.

- **Enhance Other Rules**: Review and refine other rules to make them more precise and impactful, increasing their contributions to the model's predictions.

**d. Incorporate Additional Molecular Features**

- **Expand Feature Set**: Include additional molecular descriptors such as electronic properties (e.g., HOMO-LUMO gap), steric parameters (e.g., molecular volume), or hydrophobicity (e.g., LogP).

- **Feature Engineering**: Combine existing features to create new ones that may capture relevant interactions.

**e. Validate with Test Cases**

- **Implement Unit Tests**: Use specific examples and counter-examples from the dataset to test each rule’s effectiveness.

  - **Prediction**: This modifier will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Coordinating Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in an indole ring) capable of coordinating with metal centers.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: This modifier will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Terminal Thiol Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol (**–SH**) groups along the carbon chain, not directly attached to aromatic rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups are strong ligands due to the polarizability of sulfur, enhancing coordination with metal centers without causing significant steric hindrance.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: This modifier will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Attached Directly to the Ring Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly connected to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups attached to aromatic systems may bind too strongly to metal centers or create steric hindrance, potentially deactivating the catalyst or causing aggregation.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: This modifier will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Amide Linkages Near Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain amide bonds (**–CONH–**) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group, especially when connected to aromatic systems or additional functional groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide linkages can alter the electronic properties of the carboxyl group and reduce its ability to coordinate effectively with metal centers. The rigidity introduced by the amide bond may also hinder optimal catalyst interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**, Low Yield)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Ketone Substituents Adjacent to the Ring Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups (**–C=O**) adjacent to the aromatic ring, forming conjugated systems.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Conjugated ketone groups can participate in resonance and coordinate with metal centers, enhancing electron delocalization and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**, High Yield)
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers Containing Trifluoroacetyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain trifluoroacetyl (**–COCF₃**) groups within their structure.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Trifluoroacetyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing, which can interfere with catalyst coordination or reactivity. They may destabilize the catalyst or reduce its efficiency.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Compound **28**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: This modifier will result in **low yield**.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** thoroughly satisfies the criteria. The structural description is clear and unambiguous, allowing for easy identification of applicable modifiers. The physical-chemical insight is well-articulated, explaining how both amino and carboxyl groups enhance coordination with metal centers while small aliphatic chains minimize steric hindrance. The rule considers combinations of substructures (amino acids with both amino and carboxylic acid groups and short aliphatic chains). Coverage is strong, supported by three data points: Compounds 2, 0, and 3.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** meets all criteria effectively. The clarity of the structural description is high, specifying aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position, excluding aldehydes. The physical-chemical reasoning is sound, detailing how electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and coordination ability. The rule considers combinations of substructures, including both aromatic systems and specific substituents. Coverage is robust, with three supporting examples (Compounds 21, 4, and 1) and a counterexample (Compound 20) enhancing its validity.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** excels in meeting the criteria. It provides a clear description of modifiers (heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen heterocycles), and the physical-chemical insight is solid, highlighting the role of nitrogen atoms in coordination. The rule encompasses combinations of substructures and is well-supported by four data points (Compounds 22, 16, 8, and 24), fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear in its description of long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, suggesting hydrophobic interactions may enhance reactivity. It considers combinations of substructures (chain length and absence of other groups). However, coverage is limited to a single positive example (Compound 5), with counterexamples (Compounds 29, 31, and 34) indicating low yield when additional functional groups are present. The limited high-yield data points reduce the rule's reliability in terms of coverage.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** satisfies all criteria effectively. The structural description is precise, focusing on aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining how multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination and solubility. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is supported by two data points (Compounds 9 and 6), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear in identifying modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains leading to low yield. The physical-chemical rationale is adequate, noting the impact of high electronegativity and hydrophobicity. It considers specific substructural features. However, coverage is insufficient, with only one supporting example (Compound 14), which weakens its predictive power.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** effectively meets the criteria. The structural description is clear, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with para-positioned aldehyde groups. The physical-chemical insight is logical, explaining potential catalyst deactivation. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by two data points (Compounds 20 and 19), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** meets all criteria satisfactorily. The description of modifiers containing polyether chains is clear. The physical-chemical insight is sound, addressing steric effects and coordination interference. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is supported by two data points (Compounds 11 and 32), fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** provides a clear structural description of amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, highlighting steric hindrance without beneficial coordination. However, coverage is limited to a single example (Compound 13), which does not meet the required data support, reducing the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear and offers sound physical-chemical reasoning, focusing on amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms. While the rule considers combinations of substructures, coverage is limited to one example (Compound 15), which is insufficient for robust predictive capability.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** clearly describes aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal thiol groups leading to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, emphasizing strong coordination provided by thiol groups. Despite considering combinations of substructures, coverage is limited to a single data point (Compound 18), which weakens the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** presents a clear description of aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups attached directly to the ring leading to low yield. The physical-chemical insight discusses potential catalyst deactivation due to strong binding or steric effects. Coverage is insufficient, with only one supporting example (Compound 10), reducing confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** satisfies all criteria effectively. The structural description is clear, focusing on modifiers with amide linkages near carboxyl groups. The physical-chemical insight is substantial, explaining alterations in electronic properties affecting coordination. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by two data points (Compounds 26 and 33), meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** meets all criteria successfully. The structural description is clear, describing aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone substituents adjacent to the ring. The physical-chemical insight is solid, highlighting resonance participation and enhanced coordination. It considers complex substructures and is supported by two data points (Compounds 17 and 25), fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is clear in identifying modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl groups leading to low yield. The physical-chemical rationale is adequate, noting the impact of strong electron-withdrawing effects. However, coverage is limited to a single example (Compound 28), which diminishes the rule's robustness.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: Update the SMARTS patterns for `ewg_para_substituents` in **Rule 2** to include amino groups (`-NH₂`) and halomethyl groups (`-CH₂Br`) at the para position. The current code only includes halogens and nitro groups but omits amino and halomethyl substituents which are specified in the rule. For example, add patterns like `'[c][c][c](N)[c][c][c](C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])'` for amino groups and `'[c][c][c](CBr)[c][c][c](C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])'` for halomethyl groups.

- **Suggestion 2**: Incorporate the chain length restriction into **Rule 1** by modifying the SMARTS patterns to specify straight aliphatic chains of up to five carbons without bulky or aromatic side chains. The current patterns do not enforce chain length or exclude bulky/aromatic groups. Adjust the patterns to reflect chains like `'[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;!$([N][!C])][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` to limit the chain length and ensure the absence of branching or rings.

- **Suggestion 3**: Correct the implementation of `count_threshold` in **Rule 5**. Ensure that the counts are correctly associated with their respective SMARTS patterns. When matching patterns, use a dictionary or a mapping that relates each SMARTS string to its count threshold, considering that `pat.GetSmarts()` may not return the exact SMARTS string used as the key in `count_threshold`. Alternatively, use the pattern objects themselves as keys.

- **Suggestion 4**: Review and refine the SMARTS patterns and exclusion criteria for **all rules** to ensure they accurately represent the natural language descriptions. For example, in **Rule 4**, adjust the exclude patterns to ensure that additional functional groups like hydroxyl, amino, or thiol groups are properly excluded from long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 5**: For **Rule 3**, expand the SMARTS patterns to include all relevant nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings attached directly to carboxylic acid groups. For instance, include patterns for pyridone and other specified heterocycles.

- **Suggestion 6**: In **Rule 7** and **Rule 12**, ensure that the patterns for aldehyde and thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings accurately match the intended structures. Verify that the exclusion of these groups is correctly implemented.

- **Suggestion 7**: Add tests and validation steps in the code for each rule. For each rule, provide examples of SMILES strings that should match (from the rule's examples) and confirm that the code correctly predicts the high or low yield. This will help identify any mismatches between the intended rules and their implementation.

- **Suggestion 8**: Enhance the code's modularity by defining SMARTS patterns for common functional groups and reusing them across different rules where applicable. This reduces redundancy and potential inconsistencies in pattern definitions.

- **Suggestion 9**: Include detailed comments and documentation within the code to explain the reasoning behind each SMARTS pattern and how it correlates with the natural language rules. This will aid in future maintenance and updates to the code.

- **Suggestion 10**: Consider utilizing RDKit's functionalities to enforce structural features such as chain length, absence of branching, and absence of specific groups, perhaps through the use of molecular descriptors or additional conditional checks beyond SMARTS patterns.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance:**

The current rule set shows the following metrics:

- **Train Support**: 0.0190
- **Train Confidence**: 0.625
- **Train Lift**: 1.2586
- **Train Leverage**: 0.0037

**Comparison with Previous Metrics:**

1. **Confidence**:
   - **Previous Train Confidence (Average)**: [0.6352, 0.5396]
   - **Previous Test Confidence (Average)**: [0.3333, 0.4639]
   - **Current Train Confidence**: 0.625

   The current confidence of 0.625 is comparable to the previous train confidence metrics, indicating that the rules are maintaining a similar level of accuracy in predicting high yields.

2. **Lift**:
   - **Previous Train Lift (Average)**: [1.2048, 1.0559]
   - **Previous Test Lift (Average)**: [0.6889, 0.9137]
   - **Current Train Lift**: 1.2586

   The current lift of 1.2586 is higher than the average previous train lift values. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rules are effective in improving the prediction over random chance. The increase suggests that the current rules are identifying associations that are more significant than before.

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

Given that the current confidence and lift metrics are similar to or slightly improved compared to previous values, and considering that the support is relatively low (0.0190), it is possible that the optimization process is approaching a local minimum. The low support indicates that the rules apply to a small portion of the training data, which may limit their generalizability.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Increase Rule Support**:
   - **Issue**: Low support (0.0190) means the rules cover a small fraction of the data.
   - **Recommendation**: Modify existing rules or develop new ones that cover a broader portion of the dataset without sacrificing confidence and lift. This can enhance the robustness and applicability of the rules.

2. **Balance Specificity and Generality**:
   - **Issue**: Highly specific rules may have high confidence and lift but low support.
   - **Recommendation**: Aim for rules that strike a balance between being specific enough to maintain high confidence and general enough to cover more cases. This might involve combining similar rules or focusing on key functional groups that have a broader impact.

3. **Analyze Misclassified Cases**:
   - **Issue**: Some modifiers may not fit any current rule, leading to lower overall performance.
   - **Recommendation**: Examine the modifiers that are not correctly predicted by the current rules to identify common features or patterns that could inform new rule development.

4. **Evaluate Overfitting Risks**:
   - **Issue**: High lift and confidence on training data might not translate to test data if the model is overfitting.
   - **Recommendation**: Validate the rules on a separate test set to ensure that they generalize well. Adjust the rules if necessary to improve performance on unseen data.

5. **Incorporate Quantitative Descriptors**:
   - **Issue**: Relying solely on qualitative descriptors may miss subtle but important factors.
   - **Recommendation**: Integrate quantitative physical-chemical properties (e.g., pKa, LogP, molecular weight) into the rules to enhance their predictive power.

6. **Iterate Further with Feedback**:
   - **Issue**: The possibility of a local minimum suggests that the current optimization may have plateaued.
   - **Recommendation**: Continue iterating, perhaps using different algorithms or approaches (e.g., machine learning techniques), to explore new rule sets that could escape the local minimum and improve performance.

**Conclusion:**

While the current rules exhibit satisfactory confidence and lift, indicating good predictive ability, the low support suggests limited coverage of the dataset. By addressing the support issue and refining the rules to be both accurate and broadly applicable, the overall performance can be enhanced. Further iterations and careful analysis of the data are recommended to achieve a more optimal set of rules.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the performance of the current rules shows a decrease in validation accuracy compared to previous iterations. Here is a summary:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies**: The validation accuracies were consistently around **76%**, as seen in the reference metrics:
  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625

- **Current Validation Accuracy**: The latest 5-fold validation performance shows an accuracy of **62.86%**:
  - An accuracy of 0.6285714285714286 was obtained using the classification model.

**Effectiveness of Current Rules**

The decrease in validation accuracy indicates that the current rules are **less effective** than previous iterations. The decline suggests that the model's ability to generalize and accurately predict catalyst loading based on the existing rules has diminished.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Underfitting**: The reduction in accuracy points toward underfitting. The current rules may be too simplistic or not comprehensive enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on the validation set.
- **Overfitting**: There is no strong evidence of overfitting since both training and validation accuracies are low. However, if certain rules are overemphasizing specific features, they might not generalize well.

**Discrepancies Identified through SHAP Analysis**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into which rules are influencing the model's predictions, particularly in cases where predictions do not match experimental values.

1. **Molecules Where Predicted Loading is High but Experimental Value is Low** (Overestimation):

   - **Molecule**: C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
     - **Predicted Loading**: High
     - **Experimental Value**: Low
     - **SHAP Values**:
       - Rule1: **+0.0646**
       - Rule6: +0.0447
       - Rule8: +0.0244
       - Rule12: +0.0244
     - **Analysis**: Rule1 has the highest positive SHAP value, indicating it significantly contributes to overestimating the loading.

   - **Molecule**: C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O
     - **Predicted Loading**: High
     - **Experimental Value**: Low
     - **SHAP Values**:
       - Rule1: **+0.0646**
       - Rule6: +0.0447
       - Rule8: +0.0244
       - Rule12: +0.0244
     - **Analysis**: Similar to the previous molecule, Rule1 is the primary contributor to overestimation.

2. **Molecules Where Predicted Loading is Low but Experimental Value is High** (Underestimation):

   - **Molecule**: C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
     - **Predicted Loading**: Low
     - **Experimental Value**: High
     - **SHAP Values**:
       - Rule1: **–0.1903**
       - Rule3: –0.0351
       - Rule6: +0.0302
       - Rule8: +0.0143
       - Rule12: +0.0143
     - **Analysis**: Rule1 has a significant negative SHAP value, indicating it heavily contributes to underestimating the loading.

   - **Molecule**: C(CCN)CC(=O)O
     - **Predicted Loading**: Low
     - **Experimental Value**: High
     - **SHAP Values**:
       - Rule1: **–0.2201**
       - Rule3: –0.0317
       - Rule6: +0.0125
       - Rule8: +0.0125
       - Rule12: +0.0125
     - **Analysis**: Again, Rule1 is the major contributor to underestimation due to its negative SHAP value.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

- **Probability of Improvement**: Given that the validation accuracy has decreased, there is a high probability that refining the current rules can lead to performance improvements. The shift in accuracy indicates that previous iterations may have captured the data patterns more effectively.
- **Local Minimum**: The model may have reached a local minimum where additional iterations without substantial changes to the rules are unlikely to yield better results.

**Insights from SHAP Analysis for Improving Current Rules**

- **Rule1's Influence**: Rule1 shows significant SHAP values in mispredicted cases, both positive and negative, suggesting it may not be accurately capturing the necessary features.
- **Consistency Across Cases**: The consistent involvement of Rule1 in mispredictions indicates it may be overgeneralized or misapplied to certain molecules.
- **Impact of Other Rules**: Rules 6, 8, and 12 also contribute to mispredictions but to a lesser extent than Rule1.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis, here are suggestions to improve the current rules:

1. **Refine Rule1 for Better Specificity**

   - **Issue**: Rule1 is too broad, leading to incorrect predictions.
   - **Action**:
     - **Introduce Additional Criteria**: Add more specific conditions to Rule1 to distinguish between modifiers that truly lead to high yield and those that do not.
     - **Consider Side Chain Variations**: Examine the impact of side chain length, branching, and the presence of additional functional groups.
     - **Exclude Certain Molecules**: Identify and exclude molecules from Rule1 that structurally do not conform to its original intent but currently fall under it due to broad definitions.

2. **Adjust Rule6 and Rule8**

   - **Issue**: These rules contribute positively to overestimations in some cases.
   - **Action**:
     - **Rule6 (Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains)**:
       - **Broaden the Scope**: Include partially fluorinated alkyl chains if they also lead to low yield.
       - **Clarify Definitions**: Ensure the rule accurately identifies all relevant modifiers.
     - **Rule8 (Polyether Chains)**:
       - **Differentiate Chain Lengths**: Adjust the rule to account for the effect of polyether chain length and branching on yield.
       - **Assess Steric Effects**: Consider the impact of bulky polyether groups on catalyst interaction.

3. **Re-evaluate Rule12**

   - **Issue**: Rule12 is contributing to overestimations.
   - **Action**:
     - **Specificity in Aromatic Thiols**: Refine the rule to distinguish between different positions of thiol groups on the aromatic ring and their effects.
     - **Consider Electron Donating Effects**: Evaluate how electron-donating or withdrawing substituents on the ring influence the outcome.

4. **Incorporate New Rules or Modify Existing Ones**

   - **Analyze Misclassified Molecules**: Identify common features in mispredicted molecules that are not adequately covered by existing rules.
   - **Add Rules for Specific Functional Groups**: If certain functional groups consistently lead to mispredictions, create rules to account for their influence.
   - **Example**:
     - **Rule Modification for Beta-Amino Acids**: If beta-amino acids (amino group on the beta carbon) lead to different outcomes, adjust rules to account for their unique behavior.

5. **Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting**

   - **Expand the Dataset**: If possible, include more diverse examples in the training set to help the model learn a wider range of patterns.
   - **Regularization Techniques**: Apply regularization methods to prevent the model from becoming too simplistic.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Introduce additional molecular descriptors or features that capture important structural nuances.

6. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Analysis**

   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Use SHAP values in each iteration to identify problematic rules promptly.
   - **Rule Impact Assessment**: Quantify the overall impact of each rule on model predictions and prioritize adjustments accordingly.
   - **Validation**: After rule modifications, validate the changes by observing improvements in accuracy and reductions in mispredictions.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules require refinement to enhance the model's predictive performance. By focusing on:

- **Refining overly influential rules** (especially Rule1),
- **Adjusting rules contributing to mispredictions** (Rules 6, 8, and 12),
- **Improving rule specificity and generalization**, and
- **Leveraging insights from SHAP analysis for iterative improvement**,

we can address the underfitting issues and improve the model's accuracy. Implementing these recommendations should help in achieving validation accuracies comparable to or better than previous iterations, ensuring the rules more effectively capture the relationship between molecular structures and catalyst loading.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The recent analysis indicates that the current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction requires optimization. The key findings from the discussions are:

1. **Performance Metrics**: The validation accuracy has decreased to approximately **62.86%**, down from previous accuracies of around **76%**. This decline suggests that the model's predictive ability has diminished.

2. **Rule Effectiveness**: The SHAP analysis identifies that **Rule 1** is significantly contributing to mispredictions, both overestimations and underestimations of the yield. Other rules like **Rule 6**, **Rule 8**, and **Rule 12** also influence incorrect predictions but to a lesser extent.

3. **Rule Support and Coverage**: The current rules have **low support**, meaning they apply to a small fraction of the dataset, limiting their generalizability and effectiveness.

4. **Underfitting**: The decrease in validation accuracy and low support suggests that the model may be underfitting, indicating that the rules are too simplistic or not adequately capturing the complexities of the data.

**Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the rules and improve predictive accuracy, the following directions are recommended:

1. **Refine Rule 1 for Better Specificity**

   - **Issue**: Rule 1 is too broad, leading to misclassifications.
   - **Action**:
     - Introduce additional criteria to make Rule 1 more specific, such as stricter definitions on chain length, absence of branching, and exclusion of certain functional groups.
     - Consider side chain variations and their impact on yield, refining the rule to accurately capture the influence of different side chains.
     - Exclude molecules that do not conform to the intended scope of Rule 1 but are currently misclassified due to its broad application.

2. **Adjust Rules Contributing to Mispredictions**

   - **Rule 2**: Update the SMARTS patterns to include amino and halomethyl groups at the para position, as specified in the natural language description, ensuring that modifiers like 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid are correctly predicted.

   - **Rule 3**: Expand SMARTS patterns to include all relevant nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings, such as pyridone, to ensure complete coverage of specified modifiers.

   - **Rule 6**: Broaden the scope to include partially fluorinated alkyl chains if they also lead to low yield, and ensure the rule accurately identifies all relevant modifiers.

   - **Rule 8**: Adjust the rule to account for the effect of polyether chain length and branching on yield, considering steric effects that may influence catalyst interaction.

   - **Rule 12**: Refine the rule to distinguish between different positions of thiol groups on the aromatic ring and their effects, and consider the influence of electron-donating or withdrawing substituents.

3. **Enhance Rule Support and Coverage**

   - Develop new rules or modify existing ones to cover a broader portion of the dataset without sacrificing confidence and lift.
   - Aim for rules that balance specificity and generality, ensuring they are accurate yet applicable to more cases.
   - Examine misclassified modifiers to identify common features or patterns that could inform new rule development.

4. **Utilize SHAP Analysis for Iterative Improvement**

   - Use SHAP values to identify features and rules that contribute to mispredictions.
   - Quantify the overall impact of each rule on model predictions and prioritize adjustments accordingly.

    - **Create New Rules**: Formulate additional rules with appropriate SMARTS patterns to cover these features, increasing the overall dataset coverage.
    - **Ensure Adequate Support**: Focus on rules that apply to multiple compounds to enhance their significance and utility.

- **Advice 8**: **Utilize SHAP Analysis for Iterative Rule Refinement**

  - **Actions**:
    - **Identify Influential Features**: Use SHAP values to pinpoint which molecular features are most impactful in mispredictions.
    - **Prioritize Rule Adjustments**: Focus on modifying rules associated with high SHAP values contributing to errors.
    - **Iterate and Validate**: After adjustments, reassess the SHAP analysis to ensure that changes have improved model predictions.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Quantitative Descriptors into Rules**

  - **Actions**:
    - **Calculate Descriptors**: Use RDKit to compute properties like LogP, polar surface area (PSA), and molecular weight for each modifier.
    - **Establish Thresholds**: Determine threshold values for these descriptors that correlate with high or low yields.
    - **Integrate into Rules**: Add criteria to existing rules incorporating these quantitative measures. For instance, modifiers with LogP values below a certain threshold may be more likely to result in high yields.
    - **Example**: A rule could specify that aliphatic carboxylic acids with a LogP between X and Y and PSA above Z lead to high yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Improve Rule Implementation and SMARTS Pattern Accuracy**

  - **Actions**:
    - **Standardize Functional Group Definitions**: Create a library of SMARTS patterns for common functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acid `[CX3](=O)[OX2H]`, primary amine `[NX3;H2]`) to ensure consistency across rules.
    - **Validate SMARTS Patterns**: Test each pattern against known compounds to confirm accuracy and make corrections as needed.
    - **Align SMARTS with Descriptions**: Carefully review the natural language descriptions and ensure that the SMARTS patterns precisely match the specified criteria.
    - **Implement Code Testing**: Incorporate unit tests for each rule to detect and fix implementation errors promptly.

- **Advice 11**: **Address Underfitting by Incorporating Additional Features**

  - **Actions**:
    - **Expand the Dataset**: If possible, include more data points with diverse modifiers to enhance model learning.
    - **Include Additional Descriptors**: Beyond structural patterns, integrate other molecular features like electronic parameters or steric factors.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol groups (**–SH**) at the terminal position, away from aromatic rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups are strong ligands due to sulfur's soft Lewis base character, enhancing coordination with metal centers.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Directly Attached to the Ring Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly attached to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings may bind irreversibly to metal centers, potentially poisoning the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers Containing Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain amide linkages (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group, especially when the amide is connected to aromatic rings or additional carbonyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups can compete with carboxyl groups for metal coordination, altering electronic properties and reducing catalyst binding efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**, Low Yield)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Conjugated Ketone Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups conjugated with the aromatic ring system.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Conjugated ketone groups may participate in resonance with the aromatic system, enhancing electron delocalization and providing additional coordination sites for metal binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**, High Yield)
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Trifluoroacetyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain trifluoroacetyl (**–COCF₃**) groups within their structure.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Trifluoroacetyl groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which may destabilize metal coordination complexes or interfere with catalyst function due to their highly electronegative nature.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Compound **28**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise the SMARTS pattern for Rule 3 to accurately match heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group.** The current pattern `[n][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` does not match nicotinic acid (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) or similar compounds because it requires the carboxyl carbon to be directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, which is not the case in these structures. A better pattern would be `[c][n][c][c][c][c](C(=O)[O])`, which matches a pyridine ring with the carboxylic acid at the position next to the nitrogen. Alternatively, you can use patterns like `[nH0;r5][c;r5][c;r5][c;r5][c;r5](C(=O)[O])` to match heteroaromatic rings with the carboxylic acid adjacent to a nitrogen atom.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 5 to correctly identify aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups.** The current pattern `[OX2H][CX4][OX2H]` only matches two adjacent hydroxyl groups and may miss compounds where there are more than two hydroxyls on adjacent carbons or where hydroxyl groups are separated by other atoms. To capture polyols with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups, use a recursive SMARTS pattern like `[CX4;!$(C=O)][OX2H]`, repeated as necessary, or specifically match structures with sequences of `[OX2H][CX4][OX2H][CX4][OX2H]` for three adjacent hydroxyls.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Correct the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 to ensure accurate carbon chain length counting, excluding carbons in functional groups like carboxyl groups.** Currently, the code counts all carbons, including those in carboxyl groups, which may inaccurately exclude some compounds that should match the rule. Modify the code to count only aliphatic carbons in the main chain, excluding carbons in functional groups. This can be achieved by using molecular fragments or by explicitly excluding carbons double-bonded to oxygens when counting.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Refine the exclude pattern for Rule 2 to specifically exclude aldehyde groups at the para position, rather than any aldehyde on the aromatic ring.** The current exclude pattern `[c][CX3H](=O)` may inadvertently exclude compounds with aldehyde groups not at the para position. Use a more specific pattern like `[c][c][c](C=O)[c][c]C(=O)O` to match aldehydes at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Enhance the pattern for Rule 14 to correctly identify aromatic carboxylic acids with conjugated ketone groups.** The current patterns may not capture all variants of such compounds. Consider using patterns like `[c][CX3](=O)[c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` to ensure that both the ketone and the carboxylic acid are conjugated with the aromatic system.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Molecular Descriptors**

  - **Practical Implementation**: Convert the current qualitative rules into quantifiable descriptors that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. Focus on numerical features such as counts of specific atoms, functional groups, bond types, ring systems, or other structural motifs.

  - **Example**: Instead of stating "short-chain aliphatic amino acids with free amino and carboxylic acid groups lead to high yield," quantify the number of carbons in the aliphatic chain, presence of amino groups, and carboxylic acid groups. Create descriptors like:
    - Aliphatic chain length (number of carbons)
    - Count of primary amine groups
    - Count of carboxylic acid groups

- **Advice 2**: **Develop a Numerical Feature Matrix Using Molecular Fingerprints**

  - **Practical Implementation**: Use molecular fingerprinting methods (e.g., MACCS keys, ECFP, or Morgan fingerprints) to generate binary or count-based features from SMILES. These fingerprints can capture substructural information and be directly used in statistical or machine learning models.

  - **Example**: For each compound, generate a binary vector indicating the presence or absence of specific substructures (e.g., aromatic ring, halogen atom, hydroxyl group). This transforms qualitative structural information into a numerical format suitable for analysis.

- **Advice 3**: **Simplify and Standardize Functional Group Definitions**

  - **Practical Implementation**: Redefine functional groups in the rules using standard chemical definitions that can be programmatically detected. For instance, use SMARTS patterns to define functional groups in a way that cheminformatics software can recognize.

  - **Example**: Define "electron-withdrawing groups at the para position" using SMARTS patterns that identify substituents like nitro groups or halogens at specific positions on an aromatic ring.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Calculated Physicochemical Properties**

  - **Practical Implementation**: Include numeric physicochemical properties such as LogP (partition coefficient), pKa, molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor counts. These can be calculated from SMILES and provide quantitative data reflecting the modifiers' properties.

  - **Example**: Calculate and include descriptors like:
    - LogP value
    - Number of hydrogen bond donors
    - Number of hydrogen bond acceptors
    - Molecular weight

- **Advice 5**: **Create Rules Based on Measurable Structural Parameters**

  - **Practical Implementation**: Formulate rules that are based on measurable structural parameters that can be directly extracted from SMILES, such as:
    - Distance between functional groups (e.g., number of atoms between an amino group and a carboxyl group)
    - Degree of branching in aliphatic chains
    - Rigidity or flexibility of the molecular backbone

  - **Example**: "Modifiers where the carboxylic acid group is within three bonds of an amino group lead to high yield."

- **Advice 6**: **Automate Feature Extraction Using Cheminformatics Tools**

  - **Practical Implementation**: Utilize cheminformatics libraries (such as RDKit) to automate the extraction of features from SMILES strings based on the revised rules. This ensures consistency and efficiency in generating the numerical feature matrix.

  - **Example**: Write scripts to parse SMILES strings and output a feature matrix with columns representing the presence or count of specific functional groups or structural features defined in the rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Modify Rules to Be Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive**

  - **Practical Implementation**: Adjust the rules to eliminate overlaps and gaps, ensuring that each modifier fits into one rule only. This aids in unambiguous classification and simplifies the feature matrix construction.

  - **Example**: Refine rules to specify exact criteria, such as chain length ranges or specific substituents, so that each modifier matches only one rule category.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Machine Learnable Patterns**

  - **Practical Implementation**: Frame the rules to highlight patterns that machine learning algorithms can easily learn from numerical data, such as counts, binary indicators, or continuous values, rather than complex chemical descriptions.

  - **Example**: Use descriptors like:
    - Presence (1) or absence (0) of a thiol group
    - Number of fluorine atoms in the molecule
    - Total number of rings in the structure

- **Advice 9**: **Prioritize High-Impact Descriptors**

  - **Practical Implementation**: Identify and focus on descriptors that have the most significant impact on the yield, potentially through statistical analysis or feature importance ranking. Simplify rules to emphasize these key features.

  - **Example**: If the presence of a nitrogen atom adjacent to a carboxyl group significantly correlates with high yield, prioritize this feature in the rules and feature matrix.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Iterate on the Revised Rules**

  - **Practical Implementation**: After revising the rules and generating the numerical feature matrix, validate the effectiveness of the new descriptors through modeling and adjust the rules accordingly based on performance metrics.

  - **Example**: Use regression or classification models to predict yield from the numerical features, and refine the descriptors to improve predictive accuracy.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear in its structural description, specifying short-chain aliphatic amino acids with free amino and carboxylic acid groups and lacking bulky or aromatic side chains. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, explaining how these functional groups facilitate coordination with metal centers and how minimal steric hindrance enhances catalyst interaction. The rule considers combinations of substructures (amino acids with specific chain lengths and functional groups), satisfying the complexity criterion. The coverage includes three examples (Compounds **0**, **2**, and **3**), all resulting in high yield, providing sufficient data points to support the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** provides a clear description of aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position (excluding aldehydes) leading to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound, explaining that electron-withdrawing groups enhance acidity and coordination with metal centers. The rule considers combinations of substructures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, specific substituents), meeting the complexity requirement. There are three supporting examples (Compounds **1**, **4**, and **21**) and one counterexample (Compound **20**), offering sufficient coverage and strengthening the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear in focusing on heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group leading to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, highlighting additional coordination sites due to the nitrogen atom. The rule considers combinations of substructures (heteroaromatic rings with specific positioning of nitrogen and carboxyl groups), satisfying the complexity criterion. It includes three examples (Compounds **8**, **16**, and **22**) and one counterexample (Compound **12**), providing sufficient data points. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** describes long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups leading to high yield. The physical-chemical insight relates to enhanced hydrophobic interactions and minimized interference with catalyst coordination sites. The rule considers combinations of substructures (long aliphatic chain and absence of additional functional groups), satisfying complexity. The coverage includes one example (Compound **5**) and three counterexamples with functionalized long chains (Compounds **29**, **31**, and **34**) resulting in low yield, indirectly supporting the rule. However, the limited number of positive examples reduces coverage. The balance could be improved with more data points.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** focuses on aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) leading to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, discussing increased hydrophilicity and additional coordination sites enhancing catalyst activity. The rule considers combinations of substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. The coverage includes two examples (Compounds **6** and **9**), both yielding high results, which is adequate but could be strengthened with more data points. The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** states that modifiers with terminal ether groups lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight explains that terminal ether groups reduce coordination ability and increase steric hindrance. The rule considers specific combinations of substructures (polyether chains with terminal ether groups), meeting complexity requirements. The coverage includes two examples (Compounds **11** and **32**), both resulting in low yield, supporting the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** indicates that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight addresses increased hydrophobicity and decreased polarizability, reducing interaction with the catalyst. The rule considers specific substructures (perfluoroalkyl chains), satisfying the complexity criterion. However, the coverage includes only one example (Compound **14**), which limits the rule's support due to insufficient data points. The balance between complexity and coverage could be improved with additional examples.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde substituents at the para position lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, noting that aldehyde groups may cause side reactions that deactivate the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of substructures, meeting the complexity requirement. Coverage includes two examples (Compounds **19** and **20**), both resulting in low yield, supporting the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage is good.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** states that amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains lacking donor heteroatoms lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight explains that steric hindrance impedes effective interaction with the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. However, coverage is limited to one example (Compound **13**), which weakens the support for the rule. Additional data points are needed to strengthen coverage and balance.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** indicates that amino acids with aromatic side chains containing donor heteroatoms lead to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound, highlighting how heteroatoms provide additional coordination sites. The rule considers combinations of substructures, meeting complexity requirements. Coverage includes one example (Compound **15**), resulting in high yield. The limited data point reduces the strength of the rule's support. More examples are necessary to enhance coverage and balance.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** suggests that modifiers with terminal thiol groups lead to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, noting that thiol groups are strong ligands enhancing coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. However, coverage is limited to one example (Compound **18**), weakening the rule's support. Additional data points are required to improve coverage and balance.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly attached to the ring lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight discusses the potential for catalyst poisoning due to strong binding of thiol groups. The rule considers combinations of substructures, meeting complexity requirements. Coverage includes one example (Compound **10**), resulting in low yield. The limited data diminishes the rule's support, necessitating more examples for better coverage and balance.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** states that modifiers containing amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound, explaining how amide groups can compete for metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage includes two examples (Compounds **26** and **33**), both resulting in low yield, supporting the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with conjugated ketone groups lead to high yield. The physical-chemical insight discusses enhanced electron delocalization and additional coordination sites. The rule considers combinations of substructures, meeting the complexity requirement. Coverage includes two examples (Compounds **17** and **25**), both resulting in high yield, supporting the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** specifies that modifiers with trifluoroacetyl groups lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight addresses destabilization of metal complexes due to strong electron-withdrawing effects. The rule considers specific substructures, meeting complexity requirements. However, coverage includes only one example (Compound **28**), which limits rule support due to insufficient data points. Additional examples are needed to improve coverage and balance.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Coverage by Consolidating Rules with Limited Examples**

  For rules with limited supporting examples (Rules 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15), consider consolidating them to improve coverage and robustness. Merge rules that deal with similar functional groups or effects on yield. For instance, combine Rules 7 and 15, which both involve strong electron-withdrawing groups that negatively impact yield, into a single rule about modifiers with highly electron-withdrawing substituents leading to low yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Combine Thiol-Related Rules for Clarity**

  Merge Rule 11 and Rule 12 into a single rule that highlights the effect of thiol groups on yield based on their position in the molecule. Emphasize that aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal thiol groups lead to high yield due to enhanced metal coordination, whereas aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly attached to the ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning. Provide additional examples if available to strengthen this combined rule.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rules Concerning Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains**

  Combine Rule 9 and Rule 10 into a comprehensive rule that addresses amino acids with aromatic side chains. Specify that amino acids with aromatic side chains containing donor heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) lead to high yield due to additional coordination sites, while those lacking such heteroatoms lead to low yield because of increased steric hindrance without coordination benefits. Include more examples or counterexamples to improve coverage.

- **Advice 4**: **Expand Rule 4 with Additional Examples and Detailed Insight**

  To strengthen Rule 4, include more examples of long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups that lead to high yield, if available in the dataset. Provide a deeper physical-chemical explanation of how the hydrophobic interactions between the long aliphatic chains and the catalyst or substrate enhance the reaction yield. Clarify why additional functional groups disrupt these interactions.

- **Advice 5**: **Augment Rules with Additional Data from the Dataset**

  Re-examine the dataset to identify any modifiers that fit the existing rules but were not previously included. Adding more supporting examples and counterexamples will enhance the validity of each rule. For example, identify other modifiers with perfluorinated chains or trifluoroacetyl groups (for Rules 7 and 15) to bolster these rules or determine if they should be revised.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Quantitative Yield Data for Greater Precision**

  Where possible, use the exact yield values from the dataset rather than categorizing them simply as high or low. This will allow for more precise rules that can predict not just the likelihood of a high yield but also estimate the magnitude of the yield improvement or reduction associated with specific modifiers.

- **Advice 7**: **Reassess and Simplify Overly Complex Rules**

  Review the rules to ensure they are not overly complex or restrictive. Overly detailed rules may limit their applicability to new modifiers. Simplify rules where possible without sacrificing accuracy. For example, generalize rules to encompass broader classes of functional groups with similar electronic or steric effects.

- **Advice 8**: **Ensure Consistency and Correctness of Physical-Chemical Rationales**

  Verify that the physical-chemical explanations for each rule are consistent with established chemical principles. For any rule where the rationale is uncertain or speculative, conduct further literature review or computational studies to confirm the proposed mechanisms. Correct any inconsistencies to strengthen the credibility of the rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Introduce New Rules if Patterns Are Identified**

  Analyze the dataset for any additional patterns or trends not currently captured by the existing rules. If new trends are observed, develop new rules to describe these patterns. Ensure that any new rules are supported by multiple examples and have a clear physical-chemical basis.

- **Advice 10**: **Provide Structural Illustrations for Clarity**

  Include structural diagrams or SMILES representations of key examples and counterexamples within the rules to improve clarity and assist in the identification of relevant structural features. Visual representations can help users better understand the subtle differences between modifiers that lead to high or low yields.

    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Atoms Adjacent to the Carboxyl Group Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings where the nitrogen atom is in proximity to the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The nitrogen atom offers additional coordination sites, facilitating metal-ligand interactions and enhancing catalyst activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**, High Yield)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**, High Yield)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**, Low Yield) – The carboxyl group is on a separate benzene ring, not directly attached to the nitrogen-containing ring.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbons and without additional functional groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The hydrophobic long chain may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate. The absence of polar functional groups minimizes potential interference with catalyst coordination sites.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing multiple hydroxyl (**–OH**) groups on adjacent carbons (polyols).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase hydrophilicity and provide additional coordination sites for metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Terminal Ether Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing polyether chains terminated with ether linkages (**–O–R**) rather than hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Terminal ether groups reduce the ability to coordinate with metal centers due to lack of hydrogen bonding. Polyether chains increase steric hindrance and flexibility, disrupting optimal interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**, Low Yield)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where the alkyl chain is extensively fluorinated, replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine, resulting in perfluoroalkyl chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Perfluorinated chains increase hydrophobicity and decrease polarizability, reducing solubility and interaction with the catalyst and reaction medium. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may destabilize the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Aldehyde Substituents at the Para Position Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with aldehyde groups (**–CHO**).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups may react with amines or other nucleophiles, leading to side reactions that deactivate the catalyst or consume reactants, thus reducing yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Amino Acids with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains Lacking Donor Heteroatoms Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains that lack heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., phenylalanine with a phenyl side chain).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Bulky aromatic side chains increase steric hindrance without providing coordination benefits, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., nitrogen in an indole ring).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms in aromatic rings provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol groups (**–SH**) at the terminal position, away from aromatic rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups are strong ligands due to sulfur's soft Lewis base character, enhancing coordination with metal centers.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Directly Attached to the Ring Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly attached to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings may bind irreversibly to metal centers, potentially poisoning the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers Containing Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain amide linkages (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group, especially when the amide is connected to aromatic rings or additional carbonyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups can compete with carboxyl groups for metal coordination, altering electronic properties and reducing catalyst binding efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**, Low Yield)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Conjugated Ketone Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups conjugated with the aromatic ring system.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Conjugated ketone groups may participate in resonance with the aromatic system, enhancing electron delocalization and providing additional coordination sites for metal binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**, High Yield)
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Trifluoroacetyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain trifluoroacetyl (**–COCF₃**) groups within their structure.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Trifluoroacetyl groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which may destabilize metal coordination complexes or interfere with catalyst function due to their highly electronegative nature.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Compound **28**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Enhance Rule 1 Implementation to Enforce Chain Length and Exclude Bulky/Aromatic Side Chains**

  - **Issue**: The current code for Rule 1 only checks for the presence of a primary amine and a carboxylic acid in non-aromatic molecules. It does not enforce the chain length of up to five carbons or exclude modifiers with bulky or aromatic side chains, which are essential criteria in the rule.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Enforce Chain Length**: Include a SMARTS pattern that matches amino acids with straight aliphatic chains of up to five carbons. For example, use a pattern that specifies a linear chain of carbons between the amino and carboxylic acid groups.
    - **Exclude Bulky/Aromatic Side Chains**: Add patterns to exclude molecules with additional substituents beyond simple alkyl groups on the main chain. Ensure that there are no rings or branching that introduce bulkiness.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule1_patterns = {
          'primary_amine': Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3H2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'),  # Up to 5-carbon chain
      }
      ```
    - **Add Exclude Patterns**:
      ```python
      rule1_exclude_patterns = [
          Chem.MolFromSmarts('[#6]~[*]~[#6R]'),  # Exclude molecules with rings (aromatic or non-aromatic)
          Chem.MolFromSmarts('[#6]~([#6,#1])[#6]~([#6,#1])[#6]'),  # Exclude branching carbons
      ]
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['primary_amine']):
          if not any(mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat) for pat in exclude_patterns):
              row.append(rule['prediction'])
          else:
              row.append(0)
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

- **Suggestion 2**: **Modify Rule 2 Code to Enforce Para Position of Electron-Withdrawing Groups**

  - **Issue**: The current code for Rule 2 checks for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) attached to the aromatic ring but does not enforce that these substituents are at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Specify Para Relationship**: Update the SMARTS patterns to ensure that the EWG is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. This can be achieved by defining a substructure where the carboxylic acid and EWG are connected to opposite carbons on a benzene ring.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule2_patterns = {
          'para_substituted_aromatic_carboxylic_acid': Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[EWG]'),
      }
      # Define EWG SMARTS
      EWG_smarts = [
          '[NX3](=O)[OX1]',    # Nitro group
          '[NX3H2]',           # Amino group
          '[F,Cl,Br,I]',       # Halogen
          '[CH2][F,Cl,Br,I]',  # Halomethyl group
      ]
      # Generate combined SMARTS for para relationship
      rule2_patterns['para_substituted_aromatic_carboxylic_acid'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts(
          f'c1ccc(cc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1])c[{"|".join(EWG_smarts)}]'
      )
      ```
    - **Exclude Aldehydes**:
      ```python
      rule2_exclude_patterns = [Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1])c[CX3H](=O)')]
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['para_substituted_aromatic_carboxylic_acid']):
          if not any(mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat) for pat in exclude_patterns):
              row.append(rule['prediction'])
          else:
              row.append(0)
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine Rule 3 to Accurately Capture Nitrogen Proximity in Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids**

  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern for Rule 3 may not accurately capture heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the nitrogen atom is adjacent to the carboxyl group, and the exclusion pattern might incorrectly exclude valid matches.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Create a General SMARTS Pattern**: Develop a SMARTS pattern that matches heteroaromatic rings with a nitrogen atom adjacent to a carbon bearing the carboxylic acid.
    - **Remove Unnecessary Exclude Pattern**: The `exclude_pattern` may conflict with the main pattern and is unnecessary if the main pattern is accurately defined.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule3_patterns = {
          'heteroaromatic_carboxylic_acid': Chem.MolFromSmarts('[n][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'),  # Nitrogen adjacent to aromatic carboxylic acid
      }
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['heteroaromatic_carboxylic_acid']):
          row.append(rule['prediction'])
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

- **Suggestion 4**: **Adjust Rule 4 to Enforce Chain Length and Absence of Additional Functional Groups**

  - **Issue**: The current code for Rule 4 checks for a chain of six or more carbons and the presence of a carboxylic acid but does not enforce the absence of additional functional groups effectively.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Define Long Aliphatic Chain with Carboxylic Acid**: Create a SMARTS pattern that matches a linear chain of six or more carbons ending with a carboxylic acid.
    - **Exclude Functional Groups**: Ensure that the molecule does not contain amino or hydroxyl groups or other polar functional groups.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule4_patterns = {
          'long_aliphatic_carboxylic_acid': Chem.MolFromSmarts('CCCCCCC(=O)O'),  # 6-carbon chain ending with carboxylic acid
      }
      rule4_exclude_patterns = [
          Chem.MolFromSmarts('[OX2H]'),   # Exclude hydroxyl groups
          Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3;!$(N=C)]'),    # Exclude amino groups
          Chem.MolFromSmarts('[#7;!$([N]=[C,O])]'),  # Exclude other nitrogen-containing groups
      ]
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['long_aliphatic_carboxylic_acid']):
          if not any(mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat) for pat in exclude_patterns):
              row.append(rule['prediction'])
          else:
              row.append(0)
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **Enhance Rule 5 to Detect Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups in Polyols**

  - **Issue**: The current code for Rule 5 looks for two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons but may not capture polyols effectively or exclude molecules that do not meet the criteria.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Detect Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to match molecules with multiple (more than two) hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons.
    - **Exclude Unrelated Structures**: Ensure that other functional groups that could interfere are excluded.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule5_patterns = {
          'polyol_carboxylic_acid': Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'),  # Three adjacent hydroxyls ending with carboxylic acid
      }
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['polyol_carboxylic_acid']):
          row.append(rule['prediction'])
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **Specify Terminal Ether Groups in Rule 6 with Correct Exclusions**

  - **Issue**: The current code for Rule 6 may incorrectly match molecules with internal ethers or hydroxyl groups due to the generic pattern `[#6][OX2][#6]` and insufficient exclusions.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Define Terminal Ether Group**: Create a SMARTS pattern that specifically matches ethers at the end of a carbon chain.
    - **Exclude Hydroxyl Groups**: Ensure that molecules with terminal hydroxyl groups are not matched.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule6_patterns = {
          'terminal_ether': Chem.MolFromSmarts('[#6][OX2][#6]'),
      }
      rule6_exclude_patterns = [
          Chem.MolFromSmarts('[OX2H]'),  # Exclude hydroxyl groups
          Chem.MolFromSmarts('[OX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'),  # Exclude esters
      ]
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['terminal_ether']):
          if not any(mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat) for pat in exclude_patterns):
              row.append(rule['prediction'])
          else:
              row.append(0)
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

- **Suggestion 7**: **Improve Rule 7 to Accurately Detect Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern `[CX4]([F])(F)F` may only match trifluoromethyl groups, not perfluorinated alkyl chains of varying lengths.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Create a Pattern for Perfluoroalkyl Chains**: Develop a recursive SMARTS pattern that matches alkyl chains where all hydrogens are replaced with fluorines.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule7_patterns = {
          'perfluoro_alkyl_chain': Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX4](F)(F)(F)[$([CX4](F)(F)F)]*'),  # Repeating CF3 units
      }
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['perfluoro_alkyl_chain']):
          row.append(rule['prediction'])
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

- **Suggestion 8**: **Enforce Para Position of Aldehyde in Rule 8**

  - **Issue**: Similar to Rule 2, Rule 8 requires that aldehyde substituents are at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group, but the code does not enforce this positional relationship.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Specify Para Relationship**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to ensure that the aldehyde is at the para position on the aromatic ring relative to the carboxylic acid.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule8_patterns = {
          'para_aldehyde_aromatic_carboxylic_acid': Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1])C=O'),
      }
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['para_aldehyde_aromatic_carboxylic_acid']):
          row.append(rule['prediction'])
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

- **Suggestion 9**: **Refine Rule 9 to Exclude Donor Heteroatoms and Identify Bulky Side Chains**

  - **Issue**: The current code for Rule 9 may not accurately detect amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains lacking donor heteroatoms, and may not properly exclude molecules with heteroatoms in the side chain.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Detect Bulky Aromatic Side Chains**: Create a SMARTS pattern that matches amino acids with aromatic side chains without heteroatoms.
    - **Exclude Donor Heteroatoms**: Ensure that aromatic rings in the side chain do not contain nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atoms.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule9_patterns = {
          'amino_acid_with_aromatic_side_chain': Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3][CX4][CH2][cH]'),  # Primary amine connected to aliphatic carbon chain ending with aromatic ring
      }
      rule9_exclude_patterns = [
          Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c][n,o,s]'),  # Exclude heteroatoms in the aromatic ring
      ]
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['amino_acid_with_aromatic_side_chain']):
          if not any(mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat) for pat in exclude_patterns):
              row.append(rule['prediction'])
          else:
              row.append(0)
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

- **Suggestion 10**: **Clarify Rule 10 by Ensuring Aromatic Side Chains Contain Donor Heteroatoms**

  - **Issue**: The code needs to accurately detect amino acids whose aromatic side chains contain donor heteroatoms capable of coordination, such as nitrogen in an indole ring.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Define Side Chains with Donor Heteroatoms**: Create patterns that match aromatic rings with nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur in the side chain.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule10_patterns = {
          'amino_acid_with_heteroaromatic_side_chain': Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3][CX4][CH2][c][n,o,s]'),
      }
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['amino_acid_with_heteroaromatic_side_chain']):
          row.append(rule['prediction'])
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

- **Suggestion 11**: **Ensure Terminal Thiol Groups in Rule 11 Exclude Aromatic Thiols**

  - **Issue**: The current code for Rule 11 should match modifiers with terminal thiol groups on aliphatic chains, excluding those attached directly to aromatic rings.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Define Terminal Aliphatic Thiol Group**: Use a pattern that matches thiol groups at the end of an aliphatic chain.
    - **Exclude Aromatic Thiols**: Ensure thiol groups attached to aromatic rings are not matched.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule11_patterns = {
          'terminal_aliphatic_thiol': Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX4][SX2H]'),
      }
      rule11_exclude_patterns = [
          Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c][SX2H]'),  # Exclude aromatic thiols
      ]
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['terminal_aliphatic_thiol']):
          if not mol.HasSubstructMatch(exclude_patterns['exclude_aromatic_thiol']):
              row.append(rule['prediction'])
          else:
              row.append(0)
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

- **Suggestion 12**: **Adapt Rule 12 to Specifically Detect Thiol Groups Attached to Aromatic Rings**

  - **Issue**: The code for Rule 12 should accurately identify aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly attached to the ring.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Define Aromatic Thiol Group**: Use a SMARTS pattern that matches thiol groups connected to an aromatic system.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule12_patterns = {
          'aromatic_thiol_carboxylic_acid': Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c][SX2H].[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'),  # Thiol and carboxylic acid on aromatic ring
      }
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['aromatic_thiol_carboxylic_acid']):
          row.append(rule['prediction'])
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

- **Suggestion 13**: **Ensure Rule 13 Detects Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups**

  - **Issue**: The current code may not capture all modifiers containing amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups, especially if the amide and carboxyl are part of a peptide or connected differently.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Generalize the Amide-Carboxyl Pattern**: Create a flexible pattern that matches amide bonds next to carboxyl groups, considering different connectivity.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule13_patterns = {
          'amide_adjacent_to_carboxylic_acid': Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'),
      }
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['amide_adjacent_to_carboxylic_acid']):
          row.append(rule['prediction'])
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

- **Suggestion 14**: **Modify Rule 14 to Detect Conjugated Ketone Groups in Aromatic Carboxylic Acids**

  - **Issue**: The code should match aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups conjugated with the aromatic ring system.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Create a Pattern for Conjugated Ketone Groups**: Use SMARTS that captures ketone groups adjacent to or in conjugation with the aromatic ring.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule14_patterns = {
          'aromatic_carboxylic_acid_with_conj_ketone': Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'),
      }
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['aromatic_carboxylic_acid_with_conj_ketone']):
          row.append(rule['prediction'])
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

- **Suggestion 15**: **Update Rule 15 to Accurately Match Trifluoroacetyl Groups**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern may not match all modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl groups within their structure.
  
  - **Improvement**:
    - **Create a General Pattern for Trifluoroacetyl Groups**: Ensure the pattern matches trifluoroacetyl groups attached to various parts of the molecule.
    - **Updated Code**:
      ```python
      rule15_patterns = {
          'trifluoroacetyl_group': Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[CX3](F)(F)F'),
      }
      ```
    - **Modify Matching Logic**:
      ```python
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['trifluoroacetyl_group']):
          row.append(rule['prediction'])
      else:
          row.append(0)
      ```

Metric Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Performance of the Current Rules Based on Current Metrics**

**Overview**

The current set of rules demonstrates high confidence and lift but at a significantly reduced support compared to the reference metrics. This suggests that while the rules are accurate for the instances they cover, they apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. Below is a detailed analysis focusing on confidence and lift, using the reference metrics as a baseline.

---

**1. Analysis of Metrics**

**a. Support**

- **Previous Train Support**: Average of 0.1667 and 0.1845 ≈ **0.1756**
- **Current Train Support**: **0.0248**

**Observation**: The current train support is substantially lower than the previous average. This indicates that the current rules cover a much smaller fraction of the training data.

**b. Confidence**

- **Previous Train Confidence**: Average of 0.6352 and 0.5396 ≈ **0.5874**
- **Current Train Confidence**: **0.6250**

**Observation**: The current train confidence is slightly higher than the previous average, implying that when the rules do apply, they are correct 62.5% of the time.

**c. Lift**

- **Previous Train Lift**: Average of 1.2048 and 1.0559 ≈ **1.1304**
- **Current Train Lift**: **1.2549**

**Observation**: The current train lift is higher than the previous average, indicating that the rules are more effective at predicting high yields compared to random chance.

**d. Leverage**

- **Previous Train Leverage**: Average of 0.0289 and -0.0041 ≈ **0.0124**
- **Current Train Leverage**: **0.0056**

**Observation**: The current leverage is positive but lower than the previous average, suggesting a modest improvement over random association.

---

**2. Interpretation of the Metrics**

- **High Confidence and Lift with Low Support**: The increase in confidence and lift reflects that the rules are more accurate and better at predicting high yields for the instances they cover. However, the drastic reduction in support means that these rules are applicable to a limited subset of the data.

- **Potential Overfitting**: The current rules may be too specialized, capturing niche scenarios without generalizing well to the broader dataset. This is often a sign of overfitting, where rules perform exceptionally on training data but may not translate to unseen data.

---

**3. Determining if a Local Minimum Has Been Reached**

- **Convergence Indicators**: The improvement in confidence and lift alongside decreasing support suggests that the optimization is focusing on maximizing accuracy for a small subset rather than overall performance.

- **Iteration Sufficiency**: Given that further iterations are resulting in diminishing returns—increased confidence and lift but decreasing support—it is possible that a local minimum has been reached.

- **Assessment**: It may be time to reassess the strategy, as continued iterations under the current approach are unlikely to yield significant improvements in terms of support.

---

**Suggestions on How to Improve the Current Rules**

**1. Balance Precision and Coverage**

- **Broaden Rule Applicability**: Modify existing rules to be less restrictive without compromising too much on confidence and lift. This can involve relaxing certain conditions or combining similar rules.

- **Example**: If Rule 1 specifies amino acids with straight aliphatic chains up to five carbons, consider extending the chain length or including branched chains if they show similar behavior.

**2. Introduce New Rules for Underrepresented Data**

- **Identify Gaps**: Analyze the data points not covered by the current rules to identify common features that could form the basis of new rules.

- **Diverse Functional Groups**: Include rules that account for modifiers with unique or less common functional groups that are present in the dataset.

**3. Simplify Complex Rules**

- **Reduce Complexity**: Overly complex rules can hinder generalization. Simplify rules by focusing on the most impactful features.

- **Merge Similar Rules**: Combine rules that have overlapping criteria to increase support while maintaining confidence.

**4. Utilize Statistical Techniques**

- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Use statistical methods to determine which features contribute most to high yield, prioritizing them in rule formulation.

- **Threshold Adjustments**: Re-evaluate thresholds used in the rules (e.g., chain length, electron-withdrawing strength) to find optimal balance points.

**5. Cross-Validation**

- **Test Set Evaluation**: Apply the rules to a separate test set to assess generalizability. Adjust rules based on test performance to avoid overfitting.

- **K-Fold Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the rules perform consistently across different subsets of the data.

**6. Incorporate Domain Expertise**

- **Chemical Intuition**: Consult with chemists to validate the physical-chemical reasoning behind the rules and to gain insights that may not be apparent statistically.

- **Literature Review**: Research existing literature to find documented relationships that could inform rule adjustments or new rule creation.

**7. Incremental Rule Refinement**

- **Iterative Testing**: After modifying rules, reassess the metrics to ensure that changes are leading to desired improvements.

- **Monitor Overfitting Signs**: Keep track of how changes affect support, confidence, and lift to avoid over-specialization of rules.

---

**Conclusion**

While the current rules exhibit high confidence and lift, the low support indicates limited applicability. To improve the rules:

- **Aim for a Balance**: Strive for rules that maintain high confidence and lift but also cover a larger portion of the dataset.

- **Expand Rule Coverage**: Introduce or adjust rules to include more instances without substantially sacrificing accuracy.

- **Avoid Overfitting**: Ensure that rules generalize well by validating on separate data and simplifying where possible.

By adopting these strategies, the rules will become more robust, providing valuable predictions that are both accurate and widely applicable within the dataset.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

*1. Effectiveness of Current Rules:*

The current set of rules yields a 5-fold cross-validation accuracy of **65.71%**, which is comparable to the best performance observed in previous iterations (e.g., **68.57%**). While this indicates that the rules are capturing some of the underlying patterns in the data, there is still significant room for improvement to achieve higher predictive accuracy. The consistency in performance suggests that the rules are somewhat effective but may not fully capture all relevant molecular features influencing the catalyst's performance.

*2. Assessing Overfitting/Underfitting:*

Given the relatively stable accuracy across iterations and the moderate performance level, it is less likely that the model is overfitting. Overfitting typically manifests as high training accuracy with low validation accuracy, which is not evident here. However, the model might be underfitting, as it does not capture all the complexity of the data, indicated by the misclassifications observed in the SHAP analysis. The lack of significant improvement over iterations suggests that the rules may need refinement to better generalize across different compounds.

*3. Analyzing Discrepancies Using SHAP Values:*

The SHAP analysis highlights specific molecules where there are discrepancies between predicted and experimental values. By examining these cases and the associated SHAP values, we can identify which rules are contributing to misclassifications.

**A. Cases Where Predicted Loading is High but Experimental Value is Low (Overestimation):**

**B. Cases Where Predicted Loading is Low but Experimental Value is High (Underestimation):**

1. **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
   - **Predicted Loading**: Low
   - **Experimental Value**: High
   - **Significant Negative SHAP Contributions**:
     - **Rule 1**: -0.2297 (most negative)
     - **Rule 10**: -0.0156
     - **Rule 2**: -0.0129

2. **C(CCN)CC(=O)O**
   - **Predicted Loading**: Low
   - **Experimental Value**: High
   - **Significant Negative SHAP Contributions**:
     - **Rule 1**: -0.2199
     - **Rule 2**: -0.0304
     - **Rule 10**: -0.0150

3. **C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O**
   - **Predicted Loading**: Low
   - **Experimental Value**: High
   - **Significant Negative SHAP Contributions**:
     - **Rule 1**: -0.1889
     - **Rule 2**: -0.0511

4. **C1=CC=C2C(=C1)C(=CN2)C[C@H](C(=O)O)N**
   - **Predicted Loading**: Low
   - **Experimental Value**: High
   - **Significant Negative SHAP Contributions**:
     - **Rule 2**: -0.0607
     - **Rule 9**: -0.5003 (most negative, significant impact)

*4. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:*

While the accuracy remains relatively stable, the discrepancies indicate that certain rules may be misclassifying specific types of molecules. The negative SHAP values in underpredicted cases and high positive SHAP values in overpredicted cases point towards rules that may need refinement. Improving these rules could lead to better generalization and higher overall accuracy.

*5. Insights from SHAP Analysis:*

The SHAP analysis provides valuable insights into how each rule contributes to the prediction for each molecule. By identifying the rules with the largest positive or negative SHAP values in misclassified cases, we can pinpoint which rules may be problematic.

**Observations:**

- **Rule 1** frequently contributes significantly (both positively and negatively) to the predictions and is associated with several misclassifications.
- **Rule 7**, **Rule 8**, **Rule 9**, and **Rule 11** often have substantial positive SHAP values in overestimated cases.
- **Rule 2** shows negative contributions in underpredicted cases, suggesting it may be too restrictive or improperly specified for certain molecules.
- **Rule 9** has a notably high negative SHAP value (-0.5003) in an underpredicted case, indicating potential issues with this rule's applicability.

**Performance Metrics Summary:**

- **Current Accuracy**: 65.71%
- **Previous Best Accuracy**: 68.57%
- **Consistency**: The model's performance is consistent but plateauing, suggesting that further iterations without rule adjustments may not yield significant improvements.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis above, the following recommendations are proposed to refine the current rules and improve model performance:

**1. Re-evaluate and Refine Rule 1:**

- **Issue Identified**: Rule 1 is associated with significant negative SHAP values in underpredicted cases and substantial positive SHAP values in overpredicted cases.
- **Action**:
  - **Review the Specificity of Rule 1**: Ensure that the descriptors in Rule 1 accurately capture only those molecules that truly lead to high yield. Consider whether the inclusion criteria are too broad, causing misclassification of certain molecules.
  - **Example Adjustment**: Introduce additional structural constraints or exceptions to Rule 1 to exclude molecules that do not conform to the intended modifier characteristics.

**2. Adjust Rule 7 and Rule 8 for Overestimations:**

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

*Overview*

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction shows moderate accuracy (approximately 65.7%) with potential for improvement. Analysis of the rule metrics and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values indicates specific areas where the rules may be refined to enhance predictive performance without overfitting.

**Issues Identified and Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Rule 1 (Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids)**:
   - **Issue**: The rule does not enforce the chain length of up to five carbons and does not effectively exclude modifiers with bulky or aromatic side chains.
   - **Suggestion**: Modify the rule to specify the chain length explicitly and add exclusion criteria for bulky or aromatic substituents. This ensures that only amino acids with straight aliphatic chains and without bulky side chains are included.

2. **Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para Electron-Withdrawing Substituents)**:
   - **Issue**: The rule lacks enforcement of the para position for electron-withdrawing groups and does not exclude aldehyde substituents effectively.
   - **Suggestion**: Update the rule to ensure that electron-withdrawing groups are positioned at the para location relative to the carboxylic acid group and explicitly exclude aldehyde groups. This increases the rule's specificity and accuracy.

3. **Rule 3 (Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Adjacent Nitrogen Atoms)**:
   - **Issue**: The current definition may not accurately capture the proximity of nitrogen atoms to the carboxyl group, leading to incorrect exclusions.
   - **Suggestion**: Refine the rule to specifically detect heteroaromatic rings where the nitrogen atom is adjacent to the carbon bearing the carboxylic acid. Removing unnecessary exclusion patterns can prevent valid matches from being overlooked.

4. **Rule 4 (Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids)**:
   - **Issue**: The rule does not effectively exclude modifiers with additional functional groups like amino or hydroxyl groups.
   - **Suggestion**: Adjust the rule to enforce a chain length of six or more carbons and explicitly exclude modifiers containing additional functional groups. This ensures that only unfunctionalized long-chain carboxylic acids are included.

5. **Rule 5 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups)**:
   - **Issue**: The rule may not effectively detect polyols or exclude molecules that do not meet the criteria of multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups.
   - **Suggestion**: Enhance the rule to detect modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) and exclude unrelated structures. This improves the rule's ability to identify relevant modifiers.

6. **Rule 6 (Modifiers with Terminal Ether Groups)**:
   - **Issue**: The rule may incorrectly match molecules with internal ethers or hydroxyl groups due to a generic pattern and insufficient exclusions.
   - **Suggestion**: Specify that ethers must be terminal (at the end of the carbon chain) and add exclusions for molecules with terminal hydroxyl groups or esters. This increases the rule's precision.

7. **Rule 7 (Modifiers with Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains)**:
   - **Issue**: The rule may only match trifluoromethyl groups and miss other perfluorinated chains.
   - **Suggestion**: Improve the rule to accurately detect perfluorinated alkyl chains of varying lengths by using a recursive pattern that identifies repeating perfluorinated units.

8. **Rule 8 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para Aldehyde Substituents)**:
   - **Issue**: The rule does not enforce the para position of the aldehyde group relative to the carboxylic acid.
   - **Suggestion**: Adjust the rule to ensure aldehyde substituents are at the para position, enhancing specificity and avoiding incorrect inclusions.

9. **Rule 9 (Amino Acids with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains Lacking Donor Heteroatoms)**:
   - **Issue**: The rule may not accurately exclude modifiers with heteroatoms in the side chain or detect bulky side chains effectively.
   - **Suggestion**: Refine the rule to detect bulky aromatic side chains without donor heteroatoms and explicitly exclude side chains containing heteroatoms. This prevents misclassifications.

10. **Rule 10 (Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms)**:
    - **Issue**: The rule needs to accurately identify aromatic side chains with donor heteroatoms capable of coordination.
    - **Suggestion**: Define patterns that specifically match aromatic rings with nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atoms in the side chain, ensuring that such modifiers are correctly classified.

11. **Rule 11 (Modifiers with Terminal Aliphatic Thiol Groups)**:
    - **Issue**: The rule may inadvertently include aromatic thiols or miss terminal aliphatic thiols.
    - **Suggestion**: Revise the rule to specifically detect terminal aliphatic thiol groups and exclude thiols attached directly to aromatic rings.

12. **Rule 12 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Attached to the Ring)**:
    - **Issue**: The rule may not accurately detect thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings.
    - **Suggestion**: Adapt the rule to specifically identify thiol groups connected to aromatic systems, ensuring accurate classification of these modifiers.

13. **Rule 13 (Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups)**:
    - **Issue**: The rule may not capture all relevant modifiers due to limitations in the detection pattern.
    - **Suggestion**: Generalize the pattern to detect amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups, considering various connectivity options to include all applicable modifiers.

14. **Rule 14 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Conjugated Ketone Groups)**:
    - **Issue**: The rule may not effectively detect conjugated ketone groups in aromatic systems.
    - **Suggestion**: Modify the rule to accurately detect ketone groups that are conjugated with the aromatic ring, improving its ability to identify relevant modifiers.

15. **Rule 15 (Modifiers with Trifluoroacetyl Groups)**:
    - **Issue**: The rule may not match all modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl groups within their structure.
    - **Suggestion**: Update the rule to detect trifluoroacetyl groups attached at various positions, ensuring comprehensive identification of such modifiers.

**Performance Evaluation and Potential for Further Optimization**

- **Effectiveness of Current Rules**: The current rules achieve an accuracy of approximately 65.7%, indicating they capture some underlying patterns but may not fully encompass all relevant features influencing yield.
- **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment**: The stable but moderate accuracy suggests that the model is not overfitting but may be underfitting, revealing an opportunity to improve the rules.
- **SHAP Analysis Insights**: The SHAP analysis highlights specific rules contributing to misclassifications, pointing to areas where rule refinement can enhance performance.

**Directions for Optimization**

- **Refine Rule Definitions**: Incorporate the suggested adjustments to improve specificity, coverage, and accuracy of each rule without making them overly complex.
- **Balance Rule Specificity and Generalization**: Ensure that the rules are neither too restrictive (leading to low support) nor too general (reducing confidence and lift).
- **Address Rule Conflicts and Overlaps**: Analyze interactions between rules to prevent conflicting predictions and reduce redundancy.
- **Leverage Chemical Expertise**: Incorporate domain knowledge and chemical intuition to validate and refine rules, ensuring they are grounded in sound chemical principles.
- **Iterative Testing and Validation**: Continuously assess the performance of the rules through cross-validation and SHAP analysis, making incremental adjustments based on empirical evidence.
- **Avoid Overfitting**: Ensure that refinements enhance generalization to unseen data by testing rules on separate validation sets.

**Conclusion**

There is clear potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By implementing the suggested improvements and maintaining a balance between specificity and generality, the predictive performance of the rules can be enhanced. This iterative approach, guided by both data analysis and chemical understanding, will lead to more robust and accurate predictions.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 1 to Enforce Chain Length and Exclude Bulky/Aromatic Side Chains**

  - **Issue**: Rule 1 does not strictly enforce the chain length of up to five carbons and does not effectively exclude modifiers with bulky or aromatic side chains.
  - **Suggestion**: Modify Rule 1 to specify that the amino acid modifiers must have a straight aliphatic chain containing up to five carbons, with free amino (**–NH₂**) and carboxylic acid (**–COOH**) groups. Include explicit exclusion criteria for any bulky or aromatic side chains.
  - **Implementation**: Update the SMILES patterns to detect amino acids with straight chains of up to five carbons and exclude those with side chains containing rings or bulky substituents.

- **Advice 2**: **Update Rule 2 to Enforce Para Position and Exclude Aldehyde Groups**

  - **Issue**: Rule 2 lacks enforcement of the para position for electron-withdrawing groups and does not effectively exclude aldehyde substituents.
  - **Suggestion**: Revise Rule 2 to ensure that electron-withdrawing groups are positioned at the para location relative to the carboxylic acid group and explicitly exclude aldehyde (**–CHO**) groups.
  - **Implementation**: Adjust the SMILES patterns to specify para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups such as **–NO₂**, **–NH₂**, **–Br**, or **–CH₂Br**, and include an exclusion for aldehyde groups.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rule 3 to Accurately Detect Nitrogen Adjacent to Carboxyl Group in Heteroaromatic Rings**

  - **Issue**: Rule 3 may not accurately capture the proximity of nitrogen atoms to the carboxyl group, leading to incorrect exclusions.
  - **Suggestion**: Modify Rule 3 to specifically detect carboxylic acids attached directly to nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings where the nitrogen atom is adjacent to the carboxyl-bearing carbon.
  - **Implementation**: Update the SMILES patterns to match heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms positioned adjacent to the carboxyl group, removing unnecessary exclusions.

- **Advice 4**: **Enhance Rule 4 to Exclude Functional Groups and Enforce Chain Length**

  - **Issue**: Rule 4 does not effectively exclude modifiers with additional functional groups like amino or hydroxyl groups.
  - **Suggestion**: Adjust Rule 4 to specify that the aliphatic carboxylic acids must have straight chains of six or more carbons without additional functional groups.
  - **Implementation**: Refine the SMILES patterns to detect long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking other substituents, ensuring the chain is unbranched and free of additional functional groups.

- **Advice 5**: **Improve Rule 5 to Accurately Detect Polyol Structures**

  - **Issue**: Rule 5 may not effectively detect modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups or may include unrelated structures.
  - **Suggestion**: Enhance Rule 5 to detect aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols), ensuring that hydroxyl groups are on consecutive carbons.
  - **Implementation**: Modify the SMILES patterns to match linear chains with multiple consecutive **–OH** groups and exclude structures that do not meet this criterion.

- **Advice 6**: **Specify Terminal Ether Groups in Rule 6 and Add Necessary Exclusions**

  - **Issue**: Rule 6 may incorrectly match molecules with internal ethers or hydroxyl groups due to a generic pattern and insufficient exclusions.
  - **Suggestion**: Clarify that the ethers are terminal (at the end of the carbon chain) and add exclusions for modifiers with terminal hydroxyl groups or ester functionalities.
  - **Implementation**: Adjust the SMILES patterns to detect modifiers ending with ether linkages (**–O–R**) and exclude those ending with **–OH** or **–COO–** groups.

- **Advice 7**: **Update Rule 7 to Accurately Detect Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains**

  - **Issue**: Rule 7 may only match trifluoromethyl groups and miss other perfluorinated chains.
  - **Suggestion**: Improve Rule 7 to detect perfluorinated alkyl chains of varying lengths by using recursive SMILES patterns that identify chains fully substituted with fluorine atoms.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids with Free Amino and Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with straight aliphatic chains of up to five carbons, containing free amino groups (**–NH₂**) and carboxylic acid groups (**–COOH**), and lacking bulky or aromatic side chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups facilitates strong coordination with metal centers due to their ability to donate electron pairs. The small aliphatic chain minimizes steric hindrance, enhancing interaction with the catalyst's active sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Substituents at the Para Position (Excluding Aldehydes and Thiols) Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (**–NO₂**), halogens (**–Br**), or amino (**–NH₂**) groups, excluding aldehyde (**–CHO**) and thiol (**–SH**) groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving the catalyst's reactivity and stability.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**, High Yield)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**, High Yield)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Atoms Adjacent to the Carboxyl Group Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings where the nitrogen atom is in proximity to the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The nitrogen atom provides additional lone pairs for coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. This facilitates stronger binding to the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**, High Yield)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**, High Yield)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**, Low Yield) – The carboxyl group is attached to a benzene ring, and the pyridine ring is connected via a carbon-carbon bond, reducing the effectiveness of coordination.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbons and no additional functional groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The long hydrophobic chain may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate. Lack of polar functional groups minimizes competition for coordination sites, allowing the carboxyl group to effectively bind to the metal center.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing multiple hydroxyl (**–OH**) groups on adjacent carbons (polyols), increasing the number of potential coordination sites.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate to metal centers, enhancing binding interactions. The increased hydrophilicity can improve solubility and dispersion of the catalyst in the reaction medium.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**, High Yield)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Terminal Ether Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing polyether chains terminated with ether linkages (**–O–R**) rather than hydroxyl groups, leading to decreased coordination ability.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms have lower electron-donating ability compared to hydroxyl groups and lack hydrogen bonding capability. The presence of flexible ether chains can introduce steric hindrance and decrease effective interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**, Low Yield)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where the alkyl chain is extensively fluorinated, replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine to form perfluoroalkyl chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorine's high electronegativity and low polarizability result in reduced interactions with the catalyst. Perfluorinated chains increase hydrophobicity and can lead to poor solubility in the reaction medium.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Aldehyde Substituents at the Para Position Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with aldehyde groups (**–CHO**), which can interfere with the catalyst's activity.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form unwanted side products or complexes with the catalyst, deactivating it. They can also compete with the carboxyl group for coordination sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Amino Acids with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains Lacking Donor Heteroatoms Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., phenylalanine with a phenyl group).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Bulky aromatic side chains increase steric hindrance around the coordination site without providing additional binding interactions. This can hinder the modifier's ability to effectively interact with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in an indole ring) capable of additional coordination.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of heteroatoms in the side chain increases the number of coordination sites. This enhances binding to the catalyst and improves its stability and activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol groups (**–SH**) at the terminal position, away from aromatic rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups are strong nucleophiles and can form stable metal-thiolate bonds. This enhances the modifier's ability to coordinate with the metal center of the catalyst, improving its performance.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups Directly Attached to the Ring Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups (**–SH**) directly attached to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic thiols can strongly bind to metal centers, potentially leading to catalyst poisoning or deactivation. The planar nature of the aromatic ring also introduces steric hindrance around the active site.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers Containing Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain amide linkages (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group, especially when the amide is connected to aromatic rings or additional carbonyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups can decrease the electron density of the adjacent carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Amide bonds may also introduce rigidity, affecting the overall conformation and binding efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**, Low Yield)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Conjugated Ketone Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups conjugated with the aromatic ring system, enhancing delocalization.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Conjugated systems can stabilize the negative charge during coordination. The ketone group can also participate in metal binding through its oxygen atom, providing additional coordination sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**, High Yield)
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Trifluoroacetyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain trifluoroacetyl (**–COCF₃**) groups within their structure, introducing strong electron-withdrawing effects.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Trifluoroacetyl groups can significantly withdraw electron density from the molecule, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. This can weaken interactions with the catalyst and lower its effectiveness.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Compound **28**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 1**, the current code uses the pattern `'[NX3H2][!a]'` to identify primary aliphatic amines not attached to aromatic rings. However, this pattern may miss amino acids where the amino group is on a secondary carbon (e.g., alpha-amino acids). Also, the exclude pattern `'[a]'` excludes any molecule containing an aromatic ring anywhere, which might be too broad. Consider refining the patterns to target amino acids more specifically:

  - **Revised patterns**:
    - For amino group: `'[NX3H2][CX4;$([CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H])]'` to ensure the amino group is attached to a carbon that is connected to a carboxylic acid group.
    - For carboxylic acid group: `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`
  - **Revised exclude patterns**:
    - Exclude aromatic systems directly attached to the amino acid backbone, e.g., `'[C][a]'` instead of `'[a]'`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For **Rule 2**, the code currently does not enforce substitution at the para position. To match substitutions specifically at the para position of a benzoic acid, modify the SMARTS to reflect the benzene ring with substituents at defined positions:

  - **Revised pattern**:
    - `'c1ccc(cc1C(=O)O)[NX3+](=O)[O-]'` for a para-substituted nitrobenzoic acid.
    - Use recursive SMARTS or atom indexing to specify the para position:
      - `'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)[F,Cl,Br,I,NX3+](=O)[O-]'`

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 2**'s **exclude patterns**, the current pattern `'[c][CX3H]=O'` excludes aldehyde groups anywhere on the aromatic ring. To specifically exclude aldehydes at the para position:

  - **Revised exclude pattern**:
    - `'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)C=O'` to exclude para-aldehyde substitution.
    - Similarly, exclude para-thiol substitution with `'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)S[H]'`.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For **Rule 3**, the patterns may be too restrictive. To capture heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen adjacent to the carboxyl group:

  - **Revised pattern**:
    - `'[nH0X2r5][cX3r5][cX3r5][cX3r5][cX3r5][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` for pyridine carboxylic acids.
    - Include additional heteroaromatics by expanding patterns, e.g., pyrazole, pyridazine.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For **Rule 4**, to address the chain length and ensure exclusion of additional functional groups:

  - **Revised pattern**:
    - Use a pattern that specifies a straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acid with six or more carbons: `'CCCCCCC(=O)[OX1H]'`
  - Since SMARTS cannot enforce chain length directly, consider analyzing molecular properties (e.g., using the longest chain length from molecular descriptors).

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For **Rule 5**, the code may not properly apply the count threshold due to pattern matching issues.

  - **Revised approach**:
    - After matching the carboxylic acid group, count the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule:
      - Use `mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts('[OX2H]'))` and check if the count is ≥ 2.
    - Ensure that the SMARTS used in `count_threshold` matches exactly the SMARTS patterns used in the pattern matching.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For **Rule 6**, adjust the pattern to match **terminal** ether groups:

  - **Revised pattern**:
    - `'[OX2][CH2][CH2][OX2H0]'` to match polyether chains terminated with ether linkages.
    - Ensure it does not match internal ethers by specifying terminal positions.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For **Rule 7**, broaden the pattern to capture perfluorinated alkyl chains more effectively:

  - **Revised pattern**:
    - `'[CX4]([F])([F])([F])[C,F]'` to match carbons bonded to three fluorines and any carbon or fluorine.
    - Alternatively, use recursive SMARTS to match perfluoroalkyl chains: `[$(C(F)(F)F)][C,F]`

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For **Rule 9**, the pattern may miss amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains lacking donor heteroatoms because the pattern `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][c]'` might be too general.

  - **Revised pattern**:
    - Include specificity for side chains without heteroatoms: `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][cX3H5]'` ensuring the aromatic ring lacks heteroatoms.
  - Adjust the exclude pattern to include any heteroatoms in the side chain: `'[c][!C;!H]'` to exclude rings with heteroatoms.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For **Rule 10**, ensure patterns correctly identify amino acids with aromatic side chains containing donor heteroatoms:

  - **Revised pattern**:
    - `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][c][n,o,s]'` to match aromatic rings with attached N, O, or S atoms.
  - Ensure this pattern does not inadvertently match amino acids without the desired heteroatoms.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: **General Improvement**: Test each SMARTS pattern individually against known compounds (both positive and negative examples) to verify correct matches. This will help in refining the patterns and ensuring they accurately reflect the natural language rules.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: **Data Alignment**: Ensure that the SMILES strings provided correspond correctly to the compounds discussed in the rules and examples. Inconsistent data can lead to incorrect conclusions about the effectiveness of the transformation.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: **Rule Coverage**: Implement all the rules provided (there are 15 in total), as omitting some rules could lead to an incomplete feature matrix and affect the model's predictive power.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: **Exclude Patterns Specificity**: Refine exclude patterns to avoid over-exclusion. Use more precise SMARTS that target only the unwanted structures directly related to the rule, rather than broadly excluding functional groups that may be present elsewhere in the molecule.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: **Code Structure**: Consider mapping SMARTS patterns to unique identifiers or labels to ensure clarity and avoid misalignment between patterns and their corresponding count thresholds or predictions.

** End of Suggestions **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the Rules by Focusing on Key Functional Groups**  
  Consolidate rules by grouping modifiers based on key functional groups that directly impact yield and can be easily identified in SMILES strings. For example, combine rules related to electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings into a single rule that specifies which substituents lead to high or low yield. This simplification makes it easier to generate a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Translate Descriptive Rules into SMARTS Patterns**  
  Convert the rules into SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns, which allow for the direct identification of substructures within SMILES strings. This will enable automated detection of functional groups and substructures, facilitating the creation of features for machine learning models.

- **Advice 3**: **Prioritize Quantifiable and Unambiguous Criteria**  
  Use quantifiable parameters such as the exact number of carbons, specific positions of substituents on aromatic rings (e.g., para, meta, ortho), and the presence of specific functional groups. Avoid vague terms like "long-chain" or "bulky" and replace them with precise definitions (e.g., "chains with exactly eight carbons").

- **Advice 4**: **Merge Overlapping Rules to Reduce Redundancy**  
  Identify and merge rules that have overlapping structural features or similar effects on yield. For instance, combine Rules 2 and 14, which both involve aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups, into a single, more general rule.

- **Advice 5**: **Eliminate Rules with Minimal Impact or Poor Predictive Power**  
  Review the dataset to determine which rules do not significantly contribute to yield prediction. Remove or revise rules that are not supported by sufficient data or that introduce complexity without improving predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 6**: **Include Substructure Definitions for Easy Feature Extraction**  
  For each rule, provide specific substructure definitions or fragments that can be detected in SMILES strings. Use these fragments to generate binary features indicating the presence or absence of these substructures in each molecule.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Electronic and Steric Descriptors**  
  Include rules based on calculated electronic properties (e.g., Hammett sigma constants for substituents) and steric parameters (e.g., Taft steric constants). These descriptors can be numerically calculated and used as features in modeling.

- **Advice 8**: **Develop a Hierarchical Rule Structure**  
  Organize the rules into a hierarchical structure where general rules apply first, followed by more specific rules. This approach helps in systematically applying the rules and reduces conflicts between them.

- **Advice 9**: **Use Machine Learning to Refine Rules**  
  Apply machine learning algorithms to the dataset to identify patterns and correlations that may not be evident from manual rule generation. Use these insights to refine existing rules or generate new ones that are data-driven.

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have hydroxylated aromatic rings attached via aliphatic chains; the length of the aliphatic chain influences the yield.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Longer aliphatic chains can reduce steric hindrance and allow for better coordination, while shorter chains may not sufficiently separate the aromatic ring from the coordination site, causing steric interference.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Compound **30**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers with longer aliphatic chains will result in **high yield**, whereas those with shorter chains will result in **low yield**.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids with Free Amino and Carboxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with straight aliphatic chains of up to five carbons, containing both free amino groups (**–NH₂**) and carboxylic acid groups (**–COOH**), and lacking bulky or aromatic side chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for binding to metal centers, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. The small aliphatic chain minimizes steric hindrance, allowing effective access to the active sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Strong Electron-Withdrawing Groups at the Para Position Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (**–NO₂**), bromo (**–Br**), or amino (**–NH₂**) groups, excluding aldehyde (**–CHO**) and thiol (**–SH**) groups directly attached to the ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**, High Yield)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**, High Yield)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Atoms Near the Carboxyl Group Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings where the nitrogen atom is adjacent to or near the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The nitrogen atom provides additional lone pairs for coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. This facilitates stronger binding to the catalyst's metal centers, improving the catalyst's performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**, High Yield)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**, High Yield)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**, Low Yield) – The carboxyl group is attached to a benzene ring, and the pyridine ring is connected via a carbon-carbon bond, reducing effective coordination.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbons and no additional functional groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The long hydrophobic chain may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate. The carboxyl group remains available for effective coordination with the metal center.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing multiple hydroxyl (**–OH**) groups, especially when the hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons (polyols).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate to metal centers, enhancing binding interactions. The increased hydrophilicity can improve solubility and dispersion of the catalyst in the reaction medium.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**, High Yield)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol groups (**–SH**) at the terminal position, away from aromatic rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups are strong nucleophiles and can form stable metal-thiolate bonds. This enhances the modifier's ability to coordinate with the metal center of the catalyst, improving its performance.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Terminal Ether Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing polyether chains terminated with ether linkages (**–O–R**), particularly when lacking terminal hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms have lower electron-donating ability compared to hydroxyl groups and lack hydrogen bonding capability. The presence of flexible ether chains can introduce steric hindrance and decrease effective interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**, Low Yield)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where the alkyl chain is extensively fluorinated, replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine to form perfluoroalkyl chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorine's high electronegativity and low polarizability result in reduced interactions with the catalyst. Perfluorinated chains increase hydrophobicity and can lead to poor solubility in the reaction medium.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Aldehyde Substituents Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with aldehyde groups (**–CHO**) directly attached to the ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form unwanted side products or complexes with the catalyst, deactivating it. They can also compete with the carboxyl group for coordination sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Amino Acids with Bulky Non-Coordinating Aromatic Side Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., phenylalanine with a phenyl group).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Bulky aromatic side chains increase steric hindrance around the coordination site without providing additional binding interactions. This can hinder the modifier's ability to effectively interact with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in an indole ring) capable of additional coordination.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of heteroatoms in the side chain increases the number of coordination sites. This enhances binding to the catalyst and improves its stability and activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide linkages (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group, especially when the amide is connected to aromatic rings or additional carbonyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups can decrease the electron density of the adjacent carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Amide bonds may also introduce rigidity, affecting the overall conformation and binding efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**, Low Yield)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Conjugated Ketone Groups in Aromatic Systems Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups conjugated within the aromatic ring system, enhancing electron delocalization.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Conjugated systems can stabilize negative charge during coordination. The ketone group can also participate in metal binding through its oxygen atom, providing additional coordination sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**, High Yield)
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Trifluoroacetyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain trifluoroacetyl (**–COCF₃**) groups within their structure, introducing strong electron-withdrawing effects.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Trifluoroacetyl groups can significantly withdraw electron density from the molecule, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. This can weaken interactions with the catalyst and lower its effectiveness.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Compound **28**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Hydroxylated Aromatic Rings Connected by Aliphatic Chains Lead to Variable Yield Based on Chain Length**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have hydroxylated aromatic rings attached via aliphatic chains; the length of the aliphatic chain influences the yield.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Longer aliphatic chains can reduce steric hindrance and allow for better coordination, while shorter chains may not sufficiently separate the aromatic ring from the coordination site, causing steric interference.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Compound **30**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers with longer aliphatic chains will result in **high yield**, whereas those with shorter chains will result in **low yield**.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: *For **Rule 1**, the code should include a restriction on the carbon chain length to reflect "short-chain aliphatic amino acids with straight aliphatic chains of up to five carbons." Currently, the code does not limit the chain length, which may cause false positives for longer-chain amino acids. Consider adding a pattern that specifies aliphatic chains of five or fewer carbons, such as using recursive SMARTS patterns or atom counting.*

- **Suggestion 2**: *For **Rule 2**, the code should enforce the substitution pattern to ensure that the electron-withdrawing group is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group. Currently, it checks for the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and an electron-withdrawing group on the aromatic ring but does not ensure that they are para to each other. Modify the SMARTS patterns to specify the para substitution, possibly using ring templates with position annotations.*

- **Suggestion 3**: *For **Rule 3**, the code could be improved by generalizing the pattern to capture various heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms near the carboxyl group. The current pattern `[n][c][c][c][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` may miss molecules where the nitrogen is not directly adjacent. Consider using a more flexible pattern that allows for different positions of the nitrogen atom, such as `[n][c][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` or employing aromatic ring searches with variable atom positions.*

- **Suggestion 4**: *For **Rule 4**, the code should better define "long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbons" and exclude molecules with additional functional groups. The current pattern matches an exact chain length and specific structure. Instead, use patterns that detect aliphatic chains with six or more carbons, such as `[CH2]{$([CH2])}$[CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`, where the repetitive unit `$([CH2])` can be adjusted to match chains of varying lengths, and add exclusion patterns for additional functional groups.*

- **Suggestion 5**: *For **Rule 5**, the code currently looks for two adjacent hydroxyl groups, but the rule mentions "multiple hydroxyl groups, especially when on adjacent carbons." The code should be adjusted to detect molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, not just two. Consider using a pattern like `[$([OX2H][CX4][OX2H])]`, which can be extended to find polyols by searching for multiple occurrences of hydroxyl groups attached to adjacent carbons.*

- **Suggestion 6**: *For **Rule 6**, the code's pattern for the terminal thiol group `[SX2H][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` is specific and may miss molecules with longer aliphatic chains. To capture all aliphatic chains with terminal thiol groups, use a more general pattern such as `[SX2H][CH2]*[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`, where `[CH2]*` allows for variable chain lengths.*

- **Suggestion 7**: *For **Rule 7**, the code detects polyether chains with a specific pattern `[CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4]`, which may not capture longer or branched ether chains. Use a more flexible pattern like `[CX4]([OX2][CX4])*[OX2][CX4]`, allowing for variable lengths of polyether chains terminated with ether linkages, to better match the rule's intent.*

- **Suggestion 8**: *For **Rule 8**, the code uses the pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` to detect trifluoromethyl groups but may miss other perfluorinated alkyl chains. Expand the pattern to identify perfluorinated chains of various lengths, such as `[$([CX4](F)(F)(F))][CX4](F)(F)[F]*`, to ensure all perfluorinated chains are captured.*

- **Suggestion 9**: *For **Rule 10**, the code excludes molecules with any heteroatoms in the side chain using the pattern `['[n]']`, but this could exclude molecules incorrectly. Since the rule pertains specifically to bulky non-coordinating aromatic side chains lacking donor heteroatoms, refine the exclusion to aromatic rings without heteroatoms capable of coordination. Adjust the patterns to detect aromatic side chains with only carbon atoms, such as identifying phenyl groups specifically.*

- **Suggestion 10**: *For **Rule 15**, the code accounts for modifiers with longer aliphatic chains leading to high yield but does not address shorter chains leading to low yield. Add additional patterns and rules for short-chain modifiers connected to hydroxylated aromatic rings that result in low yield, and use a variable to represent chain length in the pattern to differentiate between high and low yield predictions based on chain length.*

1. **Confidence:**
   - **Previous Train Confidence:** [0.6352, 0.5396] (Average ≈ 0.5874)
   - **Current Train Confidence:** 0.6917
   - **Observation:** The current rules demonstrate a significant increase in confidence compared to the previous iteration. A confidence level of 0.6917 indicates that when the rule conditions are met, there is a 69.17% chance that the prediction (high yield) is correct.

2. **Lift:**
   - **Previous Train Lift:** [1.2048, 1.0559] (Average ≈ 1.1304)
   - **Current Train Lift:** 1.3826
   - **Observation:** The lift has increased notably in the current iteration. A lift of 1.3826 means that the occurrence of high yield is 38.26% more likely when the rule conditions are satisfied than without any specific condition.

3. **Support:**
   - **Previous Train Support:** [0.1667, 0.1845] (Average ≈ 0.1756)
   - **Current Train Support:** 0.0229
   - **Observation:** There is a substantial decrease in support. The current rules apply to only 2.29% of the training data, compared to approximately 17.56% in the previous iteration.

4. **Leverage:**
   - **Previous Train Leverage:** [0.0289, -0.0041] (Average ≈ 0.0124)
   - **Current Train Leverage:** 0.0065
   - **Observation:** The leverage has decreased slightly, indicating a modest reduction in the difference between observed and expected rule support if items were independent.

**Interpretation of Metrics:**

- **Increased Confidence and Lift:**
  - The higher confidence suggests that the current rules are more reliable when making predictions—they are correct more often when they are applied.
  - The increased lift implies that the current rules are more informative and have a stronger association with high yield compared to the previous rules.

- **Decreased Support:**
  - The significant drop in support indicates that the current rules cover a much smaller portion of the dataset. While they are more accurate when applicable, they apply to fewer cases.

- **Leverage Analysis:**
  - A positive leverage value, albeit small, indicates a stronger association than expected by chance. However, the decrease suggests the rules may not be leveraging as much additional information as before.

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

- The improvement in confidence and lift, coupled with the decrease in support, suggests that the model is becoming more specific—focusing on a narrower subset of data where it can make accurate predictions.
- This pattern often indicates that the model may be approaching a **local maximum** in terms of confidence and lift but a **local minimum** in terms of support.
- The trade-off between confidence (precision) and support (coverage) is common. High confidence with low support may not be practical if the rules do not cover enough cases to be useful.
- Given the current metrics, it appears that the iteration has focused on refining the rules to be highly accurate for a small subset, potentially reaching a local minimum where further iterations may not yield significant gains without addressing the support issue.

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules:**

1. **Balance Precision and Coverage:**
   - **Objective:** Aim to increase the support (coverage of the rules) while maintaining high confidence and lift.
   - **Action:** Review the specificity of the current rules to identify areas where the conditions may be too restrictive.

2. **Generalize Rule Conditions:**
   - **Objective:** Modify overly specific rules to encompass a broader range of modifiers without significantly sacrificing confidence.
   - **Action Steps:**
     - **Identify Common Features:** Look for shared structural or electronic characteristics among high-yield modifiers that are not currently included in the rules.
     - **Relax Constraints:** Adjust rules to allow for slight variations in functional groups or chain lengths if they do not drastically affect the outcome.
     - **Merge Similar Rules:** Combine rules that predict high yield based on similar underlying properties to improve support.

3. **Re-evaluate Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure that the physical-chemical justifications for the rules are accurate and encompass a wider range of compounds.
   - **Action:** Reassess assumptions about how specific functional groups or molecular features affect yield, potentially updating rules to reflect more general principles.

4. **Incorporate Negative Examples:**
   - **Objective:** Improve rule robustness by considering why certain modifiers do not lead to high yield despite having similar features.
   - **Action:** Analyze modifiers that are exceptions to the current rules to refine the conditions and prevent overgeneralization.

5. **Increase Dataset Diversity:**
   - **Objective:** Enhance the model’s ability to generalize by including a wider variety of modifiers in the analysis.
   - **Action:** If possible, expand the dataset with additional compounds that fill gaps between high and low yield modifiers, providing more information for rule refinement.

6. **Apply Cross-Validation Techniques:**
   - **Objective:** Evaluate the rules’ performance on unseen data to ensure they are not overfitting.
   - **Action:** Use k-fold cross-validation or other resampling methods to test the rules’ generalizability and adjust them based on performance.

7. **Consider Statistical Significance:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure that the observed lift and confidence values are statistically significant and not due to random chance.
   - **Action:** Perform statistical tests (e.g., chi-squared tests) to validate the strength of associations identified by the rules.

8. **Iterative Rule Refinement:**
   - **Objective:** Continue refining rules through iterative analysis, focusing on both increasing support and maintaining high confidence.
   - **Action:** Set thresholds for minimum acceptable support and confidence levels to guide rule adjustments in subsequent iterations.

**Specific Suggestions for Rule Improvement:**

- **Rule Consolidation:**
  - **Combine Rules with Similar Mechanisms:** For example, Rules 1 and 11 both deal with amino acids leading to high yield. Consider whether these can be merged to cover more compounds.

- **Adjust Chain Length Criteria:**
  - **Revisit Chain Length Restrictions:** In Rules 4 and 15, consider whether slightly shorter or longer aliphatic chains still result in high yield and adjust the rules accordingly to increase support.

- **Functional Group Variability:**
  - **Include Related Functional Groups:** If certain functional groups are critical (e.g., hydroxyl groups in Rule 5), explore whether modifiers with similar groups (e.g., methoxy groups) also perform well.

- **Threshold Adjustment:**
  - **Lower Confidence Threshold Slightly:** Accepting a slightly lower confidence level may allow the inclusion of more modifiers, increasing support without severely impacting overall accuracy.

**Conclusion:**

The current rules are highly confident and demonstrate strong predictive power when they apply, as indicated by the increased confidence and lift metrics. However, their applicability is limited due to low support, meaning they do not cover a sufficient portion of the dataset to be broadly useful.

To improve the rules:

- **Aim for a Balance:** Strive to find a balance between the generality of the rules (support) and their predictive accuracy (confidence and lift).
- **Iterative Process:** Continue refining the rules through iterations, with each focusing on expanding coverage while monitoring changes in confidence and lift.
- **Holistic Approach:** Consider both the statistical performance of the rules and the underlying chemical principles to ensure they are both effective and scientifically sound.

By implementing these improvements, the rules can become more generalizable and practical for predicting high-yield outcomes in a wider range of modifiers, ultimately enhancing their utility in the research program.

**Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation Set and Train Set**

**1. Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

Based on the provided data, the initial validation accuracies were consistently around 0.76, with test accuracies of 0.75 and 0.625 in the reference datasets. During the iterations of this program, the validation accuracies fluctuated, reaching as low as 0.4286 and as high as 0.6857 in the latest iteration.

- **Previous Reference Accuracies:**
  - **Validation Accuracies:** `[0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]` and variations with min 0.68
  - **Test Accuracies:** `0.75` and `0.625`

- **Current Iteration Accuracies:**
  - **Validation Accuracies:**
    - Iteration 1: `0.6857`
    - Iteration 2: `0.4286`
    - Iteration 3: `0.6286`
    - Iteration 4: `0.6286`
    - Iteration 5: `0.6571`
    - **Latest Iteration:** `0.6857`

**Interpretation:**

- The validation accuracy has decreased from the initial reference of `~0.76` to `0.6857` in the latest iteration.
- There is considerable fluctuation in the validation accuracies across iterations.
- The decrease suggests that the current rules may not be capturing the data patterns as effectively as before.
- The fluctuations indicate potential issues with model stability and consistency.

**2. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

- **Underfitting Indicators:**
  - The model's decreased accuracy compared to the reference suggests it may not be capturing the underlying patterns sufficiently.
  - The low accuracy in Iteration 2 (`0.4286`) indicates significant underfitting during that iteration.

- **Overfitting Indicators:**
  - Fluctuations in accuracy could imply overfitting in some iterations if the model performs well on the training set but poorly on the validation set.
  - However, consistent low validation accuracies suggest underfitting is a more significant issue.

**Conclusion:**

- The current set of rules may be underfitting the data, failing to capture essential patterns necessary for accurate predictions.
- There is room for improvement in the effectiveness of the rules to enhance model performance.

**Analysis Based on the SHAP Value Calculated on the Validation Set**

**3. Discrepancy Analysis Using SHAP Values:**

SHAP values help identify how each rule (feature) contributes to the prediction for each molecule. By analyzing molecules with mispredictions, we can identify problematic rules.

**a. Molecules with High Predicted Loading but Low Experimental Value (False Positives):**

- **Molecules:** 
  - `C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`
  - `C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O`
  - `C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O`
  - `C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O`

- **Contributing Rules with Most Positive SHAP Values:**
  - **Rule 1:** Positive SHAP values contributing significantly to overestimation.
  - **Rule 8:** Positive SHAP values indicating overestimation.
  - **Rule 9:** Positive SHAP values impacting the overprediction.

**b. Molecules with Low Predicted Loading but High Experimental Value (False Negatives):**

- **Molecules:**
  - `C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`
  - `C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O`

- **Contributing Rules with Most Negative SHAP Values:**
  - **Rule 1:** Negative SHAP values leading to underestimation.
  - **Rule 2:** Negative SHAP values contributing to low predictions.
  - **Rule 6:** Negative SHAP values possibly causing underprediction.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements and SHAP Insights:**

- **Accuracy Metrics Suggest:**
  - Slight improvement in the latest iteration to `0.6857` but still below the reference accuracies.
  - The lack of significant improvement suggests that the rules may not be effectively capturing new patterns.

- **SHAP Analysis Indicates:**
  - **Rule 1** has a dominant influence, both positively and negatively, suggesting it may be too broadly defined.
  - **Rules 2, 6, 8, and 9** also significantly impact predictions, indicating they may require refinement.
  - Possible redundancy or conflict among rules, leading to inconsistent contributions to predictions.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**5. Ways to Improve Current Rules Based on Analysis:**

**a. Refine Rule 1:**

- **Issue:** Rule 1 is contributing to both overestimations and underestimations, indicating it may be overly broad or not specific enough.

  - **Use cross-validation** to assess the model's generalization.
  - **Monitor SHAP values** in subsequent iterations to ensure problematic contributions are mitigated.

---

**Specific Suggestions for Rule Refinement**

**Rule 1:**

- **Current Description:** Short-chain aliphatic amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups lead to high yield.
- **Suggestions:**
  - **Specify chain length more precisely**, e.g., "Modifiers that are amino acids with straight aliphatic chains of exactly 2 or 3 carbons."
  - **Include stereochemistry considerations** if relevant, as chiral centers may affect binding.
  - **Exclude molecules with additional functional groups** that may interfere with coordination.

**Rule 2:**

- **Current Description:** Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position lead to high yield.
- **Suggestions:**
  - **Expand to include meta-substituted electron-withdrawing groups** if they also contribute to high yield.
  - **Reconsider excluding certain groups**, perhaps allow aldehyde groups if evidence supports it.

**Rule 6:**

- **Current Description:** Modifiers with terminal thiol groups on aliphatic chains lead to high yield.
- **Suggestions:**
  - **Define the acceptable chain length** for aliphatic chains with thiol groups.
  - **Consider the position of the thiol group relative to the carboxyl group**.

**Rule 8 and Rule 9:**

- **Current Description:** Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains lead to low yield; aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde substituents lead to low yield.
- **Suggestions:**
  - **Add exceptions** where these modifiers might lead to high yield.
  - **Incorporate additional parameters** such as the presence of other functional groups that can mitigate the negative effects.

---

**Conclusion**

The analysis indicates that while the current rules capture some trends in the data, there are inconsistencies contributing to mispredictions. By refining problematic rules and ensuring they are grounded in robust chemical principles, we can enhance the model's performance.

**Next Steps:**

- **Implement the suggested refinements** to the problematic rules.
- **Retrain the model** using the updated rules.
- **Evaluate the model's performance** using validation sets and SHAP analysis.
- **Iterate as necessary**, making adjustments based on ongoing analyses.

By continuously refining the rules and validating their effectiveness, we can improve the model's accuracy and its ability to generalize to new data, ultimately aiding in the rational design of effective modifiers for catalysis.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Rule Optimization**

The recent analysis of the current rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has highlighted several areas for improvement. The key observations and suggestions are as follows:

1. **Rule Performance Metrics:**
   - **Increased Confidence and Lift:** The current rules show higher confidence and lift compared to previous iterations, indicating more accurate predictions when the rules apply.
   - **Decreased Support:** There is a significant drop in support, meaning the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.
   - **Accuracy Fluctuations:** Validation accuracies have decreased from initial reference values (~76%) to around 68.57% in the latest iteration, with fluctuations across iterations.

2. **Analysis of SHAP Values:**
   - Certain rules, particularly **Rule 1**, contribute significantly to both overestimations and underestimations in predictions.
   - **Rules 2, 6, 8, and 9** also have substantial impacts on prediction errors, indicating they may require refinement.

3. **Potential Underfitting:**
   - The decrease in validation accuracies and fluctuations suggest the current rules may be underfitting, failing to capture essential patterns in the data.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

To enhance the predictive power and applicability of the rules without overfitting, the following specific suggestions are proposed:

1. **Refine Rule 1: Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids**
   - **Issue:** Rule 1 is too broad, leading to both overestimations and underestimations.
   - **Improvement:**
     - **Specify Chain Length More Precisely:** Limit the aliphatic chain length to a specific number of carbons (e.g., two to five carbons).
     - **Exclude Additional Functional Groups:** Ensure the modifiers do not contain other functional groups that may interfere with coordination.
     - **Adjust SMARTS Patterns:** Incorporate atom counting or recursive SMARTS patterns to enforce the chain length restriction in the code.

2. **Enhance Rule 2: Para-Substituted Aromatic Carboxylic Acids**
   - **Issue:** The rule does not enforce the para position of electron-withdrawing groups.
   - **Improvement:**
     - **Enforce Para Substitution:** Modify the SMARTS patterns to specify that the electron-withdrawing group is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.
     - **Broaden Electron-Withdrawing Groups:** Consider including additional groups that may lead to high yield.
     - **Reassess Exclusions:** Review the decision to exclude certain groups (e.g., aldehyde) and include them if they contribute to high yield.

3. **Generalize Rule 3: Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids**
   - **Issue:** The current pattern may miss molecules where the nitrogen atom is not directly adjacent to the carboxyl group.
   - **Improvement:**
     - **Flexible Pattern Matching:** Use more general SMARTS patterns to capture various positions of nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings.
     - **Include Additional Ring Systems:** Expand the rule to include other heterocycles with nitrogen atoms near the carboxyl group.

4. **Define Chain Length in Rule 4: Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**
   - **Issue:** The definition of "long-chain" is not precise, and additional functional groups are not excluded.
   - **Improvement:**
     - **Specify Minimum Chain Length:** Clearly define "six or more carbons" in the chain.
     - **Exclude Additional Functional Groups:** Modify patterns to exclude molecules with functional groups beyond the carboxyl group.
     - **Adjust Code Patterns:** Use patterns that detect aliphatic chains of variable lengths while excluding undesired functionalities.

5. **Adjust Rule 5: Multiple Hydroxyl Groups**
   - **Issue:** The code currently detects only two adjacent hydroxyl groups.
   - **Improvement:**
     - **Detect Multiple Hydroxyl Groups:** Adjust patterns to identify modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, not limited to adjacent ones.
     - **Include Polyols:** Use patterns that can identify polyols by searching for multiple occurrences of hydroxyl groups.

6. **Generalize Rule 6: Terminal Thiol Groups**
   - **Issue:** The pattern is too specific and may miss molecules with longer chains.
   - **Improvement:**
     - **Allow Variable Chain Lengths:** Use patterns that accommodate different lengths of aliphatic chains with terminal thiol groups.
     - **Adjust SMARTS Patterns:** Implement a pattern like `[SX2H][CH2]*[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` to capture various chain lengths.

7. **Expand Rule 7: Modifiers with Ether Groups**
   - **Issue:** Current patterns may not capture longer or branched ether chains.
   - **Improvement:**
     - **Use Flexible Patterns:** Implement patterns that allow for variable lengths and branching in ether chains.
     - **Include Termination Conditions:** Ensure the pattern detects modifiers terminated with ether linkages.

8. **Broaden Rule 8: Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains**
   - **Issue:** The pattern focuses on trifluoromethyl groups and may miss other perfluorinated chains.
   - **Improvement:**
     - **Expand Detection:** Use patterns that identify perfluorinated chains of various lengths.
     - **Include Partially Fluorinated Chains:** Consider including modifiers with high degrees of fluorination, not just fully perfluorinated chains.

9. **Refine Rule 10: Bulky Aromatic Side Chains**
   - **Issue:** Excluding molecules with any heteroatoms may be too broad.
   - **Improvement:**
     - **Specify Exclusions More Precisely:** Exclude only aromatic side chains lacking donor heteroatoms capable of coordination.
     - **Adjust Patterns:** Focus on detecting phenyl groups without heteroatoms, rather than excluding all heteroatoms.

10. **Differentiate Chain Length in Rule 15**
    - **Issue:** The rule does not address shorter chains leading to low yield.
    - **Improvement:**
      - **Define Chain Length Thresholds:** Specify chain lengths that result in high yield versus low yield.
      - **Include Additional Patterns:** Add rules for short-chain modifiers connected to hydroxylated aromatic rings leading to low yield.

**Possibility for Further Optimization without Overfitting**

Yes, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current rules have high confidence but low support, indicating that they are accurate when applicable but do not cover enough of the dataset. By implementing the above suggestions:

- **Increase Support:** Refining the rules to be more inclusive will cover a larger portion of the dataset.
- **Maintain or Improve Confidence:** Adjusting the rules carefully will prevent a significant drop in accuracy.
- **Avoid Overfitting:** By grounding the rules in chemical reasoning and empirical data, overfitting can be minimized.

Additionally, by:

- **Balancing Precision and Coverage:** Adjusting the specificity of the rules to capture more modifiers without losing predictive power.
- **Validating with Cross-Validation:** Ensuring the rules generalize well to unseen data.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Continuously refining the rules based on performance metrics and expert feedback.

**Please Optimize Rules**

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Atoms Near the Carboxyl Group Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings where the nitrogen atom is adjacent to or near the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The nitrogen atom provides additional lone pairs for coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. This facilitates stronger binding to the catalyst's metal centers, improving the catalyst's performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**, High Yield)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**, High Yield)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**, Low Yield) – The carboxyl group is attached to a benzene ring, and the pyridine ring is connected via a carbon-carbon bond, reducing effective coordination.

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbons and no additional functional groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The long hydrophobic chain may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate. The carboxyl group remains available for effective coordination with the metal center.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**, High Yield)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing multiple hydroxyl (**–OH**) groups, especially when the hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons (polyols).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate to metal centers, enhancing binding interactions. The increased hydrophilicity can improve solubility and dispersion of the catalyst in the reaction medium.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**, High Yield)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol groups (**–SH**) at the terminal position, away from aromatic rings.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups are strong nucleophiles and can form stable metal-thiolate bonds. This enhances the modifier's ability to coordinate with the metal center of the catalyst, improving its performance.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**, High Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Terminal Ether Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing polyether chains terminated with ether linkages (**–O–R**), particularly when lacking terminal hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms have lower electron-donating ability compared to hydroxyl groups and lack hydrogen bonding capability. The presence of flexible ether chains can introduce steric hindrance and decrease effective interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**, Low Yield)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where the alkyl chain is extensively fluorinated, replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine to form perfluoroalkyl chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorine's high electronegativity and low polarizability result in reduced interactions with the catalyst. Perfluorinated chains increase hydrophobicity and can lead to poor solubility in the reaction medium.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**, Low Yield)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and provides reasonable physical–chemical reasoning regarding chain length and lack of additional functional groups. It considers combinations of substructures. However, the coverage is limited, with only one supporting example for high yield, which slightly reduces its overall effectiveness.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 fulfills all criteria. It is clear, offers adequate physical–chemical insight about chelation by multiple hydroxyl groups, considers combinations of substructures (polyols), and is supported by two data points, providing sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and provides logical physical–chemical reasoning about thiol coordination. It considers combinations of substructures (thiol on aliphatic chains). The coverage is limited to one supporting example, which slightly weakens the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 meets all the criteria effectively. It is clear, provides sound physical–chemical insight regarding the reactivity of aldehyde groups, considers combinations of substructures, and is supported by two examples, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and offers reasonable physical–chemical insights about steric hindrance from bulky aromatic side chains lacking donor heteroatoms. It considers combinations of substructures but is only supported by one data point, limiting its coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear with appropriate physical–chemical reasoning about the effects of perfluorinated chains. It considers specific substructures but has limited coverage with only one supporting example, reducing its overall strength.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 satisfies all criteria. It is clear, provides physical–chemical insight about the low coordinating ability of ethers, considers combinations of substructures (terminal ethers or polyether chains), and is supported by two data points, providing adequate coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is well-formulated. It is clear and offers solid physical–chemical reasoning about amide bonds affecting coordination. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by two examples, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear and provides logical physical–chemical insights about heteroatoms enhancing coordination. It considers combinations of substructures but is only supported by one data point, which limits its coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides adequate physical–chemical reasoning about conjugated keto groups stabilizing coordination. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by two examples, offering sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear with appropriate physical–chemical insights about trifluoroacetyl groups withdrawing electron density. It considers specific substructures but has limited coverage with only one supporting example, reducing its robustness.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 effectively addresses the impact of chain length on yield. It is clear, offers sound physical–chemical reasoning, considers combinations of substructures (hydroxylated aromatic rings connected by aliphatic chains), and is supported by data showing both high and low yields, ensuring good coverage.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Amino Acids with Free Amino and Carboxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids possessing free (unprotected) amino groups (**–NH₂**) and carboxyl groups (**–COOH**), with non-bulky, aliphatic side chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Small aliphatic side chains minimize steric hindrance, allowing effective access to the active sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Substituents at the Para Position Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (**–NO₂**), amino (**–NH₂**), or halogens (**–Br**, **–Cl**).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield; aldehyde can deactivate catalyst)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield; thiol may poison catalyst)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Adjacent to the Carboxyl Group Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings where the nitrogen atom is adjacent to or near the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms offer additional lone pairs for coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbons and no additional functional groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The hydrophobic long chain may facilitate interactions with the catalyst or substrate, while the carboxyl group coordinates with the metal center.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**, Low Yield)
    - *Additional functional groups can interfere with coordination or alter solubility, leading to low yield.*

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing multiple hydroxyl (**–OH**) groups, especially when the hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons (polyols).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal centers, enhancing binding interactions. Increased hydrophilicity improves catalyst dispersion in the reaction medium.

  - **Examples**:

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield; thiol attached directly to aromatic ring may decompose or poison the catalyst)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Aldehyde Substituents Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with aldehyde groups (**–CHO**) directly attached to the ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form undesired complexes with the catalyst, deactivating it or leading to side reactions.

    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Amino Acids with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains Lacking Donor Heteroatoms Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains without heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., phenyl groups).

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where the alkyl chain is extensively fluorinated, replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine (perfluoroalkyl chains).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorine's high electronegativity and low polarizability result in weak interactions with the catalyst. Perfluorinated chains increase hydrophobicity and can reduce solubility.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Trifluoroacetyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain trifluoroacetyl (**–COCF₃**) groups within their structure.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of trifluoroacetyl groups reduces the electron density available for coordination, weakening interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Compound **28**)

  - **Prediction**: These modifiers will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Hydroxylated Aromatic Rings Connected by Aliphatic Chains Lead to Yield Depending on Chain Length**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have hydroxylated aromatic rings attached via aliphatic chains; a longer chain reduces steric hindrance and leads to higher yield.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **For Rule 1**, the current SMARTS patterns do not accurately capture amino acids like L-Glutamic acid and L-Aspartic acid. The `bulky_side_chain` pattern `[C][C][C][C]` is oversimplified and may unintentionally exclude non-bulky amino acids. To improve this:
  - **Redefine `bulky_side_chain`** to specifically represent bulky side chains, possibly by considering branched or aromatic side chains.
  - **Modify the patterns to ensure the amino and carboxyl groups are alpha to each other**, i.e., attached to the same carbon atom. Use a pattern like `[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])` to capture alpha-amino acids.
  - **Exclude bulky side chains by specifying side chains with more than two carbons or containing rings**.

- **Suggestion 2**: **For Rule 2**, the SMARTS patterns for para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups are not precise. The patterns need to ensure that the substituents are at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. To enhance accuracy:
  - **Create a single SMARTS pattern that captures benzoic acids with para-substituents**. For example, `c1ccc(cc1C(=O)[O,H])[F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-],[NH2]`.
  - **Ensure that the position of the substituent is specifically at the para position** by using position-specific patterns.

- **Suggestion 3**: **For Rule 3**, the pattern `[n,c]1[c,c,n]c[c,c,n]c1[C](=O)[O,H]` is too general and may not match heteroaromatic carboxylic acids accurately. To improve this:
  - **Specify the nitrogen atom adjacent to the carboxyl group**. Use a pattern like `[nH]1cccc1C(=O)[O,H]` for pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.
  - **Include multiple patterns to cover different heteroaromatic systems**, such as pyridine, pyrazole, and others.

- **Suggestion 4**: **For Rule 4**, the code may not correctly identify long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups. Issues include:
  - **The `exclude_functional_groups` pattern `[!#6;!#1]` is incorrect**. This pattern matches any atom that is not carbon or hydrogen, which is not effective for exclusion.
  - **Modify the exclusion to identify molecules without heteroatoms in the chain**. Use `[!$(C=O)]` to exclude carbonyls and `[!#6;!#1]` within the chain, excluding terminal groups.

- **Suggestion 5**: **For Rule 5**, the pattern for polyols may not capture molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups correctly. To enhance the pattern:
  - **Use recursive SMARTS to identify adjacent hydroxyl groups**, such as `$([CX4;$([C][OX2H])][CX4;$([C][OX2H])])`.
  - **Ensure the pattern can identify modifiers with three or more hydroxyl groups**.

- **Suggestion 6**: **For Rule 6**, the patterns may not effectively exclude aromatic systems and ensure the thiol is terminal:
  - **Modify the `exclude_aromatic` pattern** to properly exclude aromatics, possibly by asserting aliphatic conditions `[!a]`.
  - **Ensure the thiol group is terminal and separated from the carboxyl group by an aliphatic chain**.

- **Suggestion 7**: **For Rule 7**, verify that the aldehyde substituent pattern accurately matches aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups:
  - **Use a pattern like `c1cc(c(c(c1)C=O))C(=O)[O,H]`** to specify the aldehyde attached to the ring and ensure it's directly connected.

- **Suggestion 8**: **For Rule 8**, clarify the exclusion of heteroatoms in aromatic side chains:
  - **Adjust the `exclude_heteroatom_in_aromatic` pattern to exclude rings with heteroatoms**, perhaps using `c1ccccc1` to match phenyl rings without heteroatoms.

- **Suggestion 9**: **For Rule 9**, ensure that the perfluorinated chain pattern matches any perfluoroalkyl chains, not just trifluoromethyl:
  - **Use a more general pattern like `[CX4]([F])([F])[F]` repeated to capture longer perfluoroalkyl chains**.
  - **Check for consecutive carbons fully substituted with fluorines**.

- **Suggestion 10**: **For Rule 10**, improve the ether linkage pattern to detect terminal ethers and polyethers correctly:
  - **Use a pattern that identifies multiple ether linkages along the chain**, like `[$([CX4][OX2][CX4])]`.
  - **Exclude molecules with terminal hydroxyl groups by ensuring no `[OX2H]` is present**.

- **Suggestion 11**: **For Rule 15**, address chain length dependence by:
  - **Implementing a method to count the number of carbons in the aliphatic chain** connecting the aromatic ring to the carboxyl group.
  - **Using different patterns for short and long chains**, and carefully matching the chain lengths specified in the rule.

- **Suggestion 12**: **General Improvement**:
  - **Test each SMARTS pattern individually against the known examples and counterexamples** provided in each rule to ensure accuracy.
  - **Include unit tests or assert statements in the code** to verify that each pattern matches the intended structures.
  - **Consider using RDKit’s molecule annotations or recursive SMARTS** to capture complex structural features more effectively.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify Rules to Focus on Quantifiable Features Extractable from SMILES**

  Modify the rules to emphasize structural features and functional groups that can be directly identified and counted from SMILES strings. This includes aspects like the presence of specific atoms, functional groups, ring systems, or chain lengths, which facilitates the conversion into a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Similar Rules to Reduce Complexity**

  Merge overlapping or similar rules to create a more streamlined set of guidelines. For instance, combine rules concerning electron-withdrawing groups enhancing yield into a single, generalized rule specifying the types and positions of these groups.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors and Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Parameters**

  Introduce rules based on molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), and counts of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. These descriptors can be calculated from SMILES and provide numerical values for modeling.

- **Advice 4**: **Use Binary Indicators for Functional Group Presence**

  Rewrite the rules to indicate the presence or absence (1 or 0) of specific functional groups or substructures. For example, "Modifiers containing a carboxyl group (–COOH) and an amino group (–NH₂) yield high performance." This binary approach simplifies feature extraction from SMILES.

- **Advice 5**: **Prioritize Easily Computable Features over Complex Structural Relationships**

  Focus on features that do not require complex interpretation of molecular structure. Avoid rules that depend on subtle electronic effects or steric hindrance that are difficult to quantify without advanced computations.

- **Advice 6**: **Eliminate or Rephrase Rules Dependent on Non-Directly Observable Features**

  Remove rules that are based on properties not directly derivable from SMILES, such as electronic delocalization or specific atomic charge distributions. If necessary, rephrase them in terms of observable structural elements.

- **Advice 7**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions Across Rules**

  Ensure that functional groups are consistently defined and named throughout the rules. This avoids confusion and aids in automated parsing of SMILES strings to detect these groups.

- **Advice 8**: **Integrate Substructure Searching Algorithms**

  Utilize cheminformatics tools to identify specific substructures within SMILES strings. Adjust rules to align with the capabilities of these tools, allowing for automated and accurate feature extraction.

- **Advice 9**: **Include Numerical Thresholds for Quantitative Features**

  Where applicable, define numerical thresholds within the rules. For example, "Modifiers with aliphatic chains longer than six carbons lead to high yield." This allows direct translation into numerical features.

- **Advice 10**: **Engage with Data Scientists to Map Rules to Features**

  Collaborate with data scientists or cheminformatics experts to translate the chemical rules into a feature matrix. Their expertise can help in selecting appropriate descriptors and ensuring that the features are suitable for machine learning models.

- **Advice 11**: **Validate and Refine Rules Using Statistical Analysis**

  Perform statistical analysis on the dataset to identify which features have the most significant impact on yield. Refine the rules accordingly to focus on the most predictive structural characteristics.

- **Advice 12**: **Create a Hierarchical Rule Structure**

  Organize rules hierarchically from general to specific. Start with broad classifications (e.g., presence of carboxylic acid) and then narrow down to more specific features. This aids in systematic feature extraction and model training.

- **Advice 13**: **Use Chemical Fingerprints for Feature Representation**

  Represent molecules using chemical fingerprints (e.g., Morgan fingerprints) that encode the presence of various substructures. Modify rules to align with the types of patterns captured by these fingerprints.

- **Advice 14**: **Update Rules Based on Model Feedback**

  Incorporate insights from initial modeling attempts to refine the rules. If certain features do not correlate well with yield, revise or remove those rules to improve model accuracy.

- **Advice 15**: **Ensure Compatibility with Machine Learning Algorithms**

  Tailor the rules to produce features that are compatible with the intended machine learning algorithms, considering factors like feature scaling and the handling of categorical versus numerical data.

    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituted Halogen Atoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with halogen atoms such as bromine (**–Br**).

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Halogen substituents can affect the electronic properties of the aromatic ring and may enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group, improving coordination with the metal catalyst. The halogen can also engage in secondary interactions that stabilize the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups (**–CHO**) attached directly to the aromatic ring, particularly at positions ortho or para to the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are susceptible to oxidation and can interact unfavorably with the catalyst, potentially deactivating it or leading to side reactions. They may also interfere with metal coordination due to competing binding sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)

  - **Description**: Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains, where all hydrogens in the alkyl chain are replaced with fluorine atoms.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, reducing the solubility of the modifier in the reaction medium and diminishing interactions with the catalyst. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can decrease the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms have lone pairs that are less available for coordination due to their position within the molecule, and they may not effectively interact with metal centers. Polyether chains can introduce flexibility and entropic factors that reduce binding affinity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with carbon chains of six or more carbons and no additional functional groups like amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Long hydrophobic chains can enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, while the terminal carboxyl group remains available for metal coordination. The lack of additional functional groups prevents interference with catalyst binding.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield; amino group may form internal hydrogen bonds or coordinate differently)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield; hydroxyl group may engage in competing interactions)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide linkages (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group, particularly when the amide is connected to an aromatic ring or involved in conjugation.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups can delocalize electron density through resonance, reducing the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen for coordination. This delocalization can decrease the binding affinity to metal centers.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Amino Acids with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains Lacking Donor Heteroatoms Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains without heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., phenyl groups).

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Bulky side chains can cause steric hindrance, impeding access to the metal center. The absence of donor heteroatoms means fewer coordination sites, reducing interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole rings) capable of coordinating with metal centers.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms in the side chain provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and potentially stabilizing catalytic intermediates.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids Substituted with Heterocyclic Rings Lead to Variable Yield Based on Coordination Ability**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with heterocyclic rings; the yield depends on the presence of donor atoms in the heterocycle capable of effective metal coordination.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Heterocycles with available lone pairs (e.g., pyrazole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction. Heterocycles lacking such features may not contribute to coordination and can introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**; pyridine nitrogen may be less available due to steric factors or electron delocalization)

  - **Prediction**:
    - **Modifiers with coordinating heterocycles** will result in **high yield**.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid and Free Primary Amino Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain both a free primary amino group (**–NH₂**) and at least one carboxyl group (**–COOH**), especially when the molecule is an amino acid with aliphatic or heteroaromatic side chains containing donor heteroatoms.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Donor heteroatoms in the side chain (e.g., nitrogen in an indole ring) can further enhance coordination, increasing catalyst stability and activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield; lacks side-chain donor heteroatoms)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituted Electron-Donating Amino Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with amino groups (**–NH₂**).

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amino groups are strong electron donors that increase electron density on the aromatic ring and can participate in coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction and stabilizing active species.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituted Halogen Atoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with halogen atoms such as bromine (**–Br**).

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Halogen substituents can affect the electronic properties of the aromatic ring and may enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group, improving coordination with the metal catalyst. The halogen can also engage in secondary interactions that stabilize the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups (**–CHO**) attached directly to the aromatic ring, particularly at positions ortho or para to the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are susceptible to oxidation and can interact unfavorably with the catalyst, potentially deactivating it or leading to side reactions. They may also interfere with metal coordination due to competing binding sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers Containing Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups (**–OH**) in vicinal (adjacent) positions, either in aliphatic chains or aromatic systems.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups can chelate metal centers, forming stable complexes that enhance catalyst performance. This chelation increases binding affinity and can protect the metal center from deactivation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Atoms Adjacent to Carboxyl Group Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group at the 3-position relative to the nitrogen atom in the ring.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The nitrogen atom in the heteroaromatic ring provides an additional coordination site, and its proximity to the carboxyl group facilitates the formation of chelate complexes with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Perfluorinated Carboxylic Acids Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains, where all hydrogens in the alkyl chain are replaced with fluorine atoms.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, reducing the solubility of the modifier in the reaction medium and diminishing interactions with the catalyst. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can decrease the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Terminal Ether Groups or Polyether Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing ether linkages (**–O–**) at terminal positions or along the carbon chain, especially polyether chains without terminal hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms have lone pairs that are less available for coordination due to their position within the molecule, and they may not effectively interact with metal centers. Polyether chains can introduce flexibility and entropic factors that reduce binding affinity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with carbon chains of six or more carbons and no additional functional groups like amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Long hydrophobic chains can enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, while the terminal carboxyl group remains available for metal coordination. The lack of additional functional groups prevents interference with catalyst binding.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield; amino group may form internal hydrogen bonds or coordinate differently)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield; hydroxyl group may engage in competing interactions)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide linkages (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group, particularly when the amide is connected to an aromatic ring or involved in conjugation.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups can delocalize electron density through resonance, reducing the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen for coordination. This delocalization can decrease the binding affinity to metal centers.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Amino Acids with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains Lacking Donor Heteroatoms Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains without heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., phenyl groups).

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Bulky side chains can cause steric hindrance, impeding access to the metal center. The absence of donor heteroatoms means fewer coordination sites, reducing interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole rings) capable of coordinating with metal centers.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms in the side chain provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and potentially stabilizing catalytic intermediates.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Sulfhydryl Groups in Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing sulfhydryl (**–SH**) groups on short aliphatic chains along with carboxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal coordination due to the lone pair on sulfur. Short chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing effective interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield; aromatic ring may introduce steric hindrance or reduce sulfur availability)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids Substituted with Heterocyclic Rings Lead to Variable Yield Based on Coordination Ability**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with heterocyclic rings; the yield depends on the presence of donor atoms in the heterocycle capable of effective metal coordination.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Heterocycles with available lone pairs (e.g., pyrazole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction. Heterocycles lacking such features may not contribute to coordination and can introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**; pyridine nitrogen may be less available due to steric factors or electron delocalization)

  - **Prediction**:
    - **Modifiers with coordinating heterocycles** will result in **high yield**.
    - **Modifiers without effective coordination** will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Conjugated Ketone Groups in Aromatic Systems Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups conjugated within the aromatic system, enhancing electron delocalization.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Conjugated ketone groups can participate in resonance structures, increasing the electron density on coordinating atoms and providing additional sites for metal interaction, which can stabilize the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully formulated to reflect the relationships between molecular structures of modifiers and their impact on the reaction yield. The rules combine multiple functional groups and sub-structures to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different features influence catalyst performance. Each rule is grounded in physico-chemical principles, considering electronic effects, coordination chemistry, and steric factors.

- **Coverage**: The rules address a broad spectrum of functional groups present in the dataset, ensuring applicability to various modifiers.

- **Chemical Rationale**: Each rule is supported by underlying chemical principles that explain the observed effects on yield.

- **Predictive Power**: By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural features.

- **Balance**: The rules maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity, with some rules offering broader coverage and others addressing specific cases with detailed features.

These refined rules improve upon the initial set by providing clearer guidelines, eliminating less effective rules, and focusing on the most significant structural factors influencing the reaction outcome. They serve as valuable tools for guiding future experiments and optimizing reaction conditions in the context of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols.---------------------------------------------------------------

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: In **Rule 1**, the code requires the molecule to contain both the `carboxylic_acid` and `carboxylate_anion` patterns simultaneously, which is unrealistic because a molecule will typically have either a carboxylic acid **or** a carboxylate anion, not both. To correctly implement the rule, modify the code to match molecules containing **either** a carboxylic acid **or** a carboxylate anion, along with a primary amine. This can be achieved by combining the patterns using logical **OR**. For instance, create a single SMARTS pattern for a carboxyl group like `'[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]'`, which matches both protonated and deprotonated forms.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Adjust the pattern matching logic in the code to allow for **logical OR** between certain patterns within a rule. Currently, all patterns in the `'patterns'` list are combined using **logical AND**, meaning all must be present for a match. For rules where certain substructures are alternatives, such as different forms of a functional group, modify the code to check if **any** of the specified patterns are present. This can be done by combining SMARTS patterns using semicolons or implementing an alternative matching logic that accounts for logical OR conditions.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: In **Rule 9**, the `long_aliphatic_chain` pattern `'[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]'` may not adequately represent long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids. Consider revising this pattern to match chains of six or more carbons more effectively. You can use a recursive SMARTS pattern like `'CCCCCC'` or `'[CH2]5,]'` to represent chains of at least six carbons. Ensure that the `exclude_patterns` correctly exclude molecules with additional functional groups like amino or hydroxyl groups by using accurate SMARTS patterns for these groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For **Rule 11** and **Rule 12**, there is a need to distinguish between amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking donor heteroatoms and those containing donor heteroatoms. The current patterns may not effectively capture this distinction. Refine the patterns to specifically detect the presence or absence of heteroatoms capable of coordination within the side chain. For example, include patterns that detect aromatic rings with or without heteroatoms like nitrogen or oxygen.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Review and update the SMARTS patterns for each functional group and substructure to ensure they accurately represent the chemical features described in the natural language rules. For instance, in **Rule 10**, verify that the pattern for `amide_adjacent_to_carboxyl` correctly captures modifiers containing amide linkages near the carboxyl group, including cases where the amide is connected to an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Implement a debugging mechanism in the code to output which specific patterns are matched or not matched for each molecule. This can help identify discrepancies between expected matches based on the rules and actual matches in the code, facilitating easier troubleshooting and validation of the SMARTS patterns.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For **Rule 14**, the pattern `'[a][n,O,S]'` may be too broad or not accurately reflect the rule's intention. Modify the pattern to specifically detect aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with heterocyclic rings containing donor atoms capable of effective metal coordination. For example, use SMARTS patterns that detect specific heterocycles like pyridine or pyrazole rings attached to the aromatic system.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Ensure that **exclude_patterns** are properly utilized and accurately represent the substructures that should negate a match for a rule. For instance, in **Rule 8**, verify that the patterns used effectively exclude modifiers with terminal ether groups or polyether chains without terminal hydroxyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Standardize the logical operations applied to patterns within rules. Decide on a consistent approach for combining patterns using **logical AND** or **logical OR**, and clearly implement this logic in the code. This will improve the clarity of the code and reduce potential errors in pattern matching.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: After making the suggested adjustments, re-run the feature matrix generation and validate the results by comparing the matrix to the known examples and counterexamples provided for each rule. Confirm that the modifiers are correctly classified according to the rules, and adjust the patterns further if discrepancies are found.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

**Introduction**

In assessing the performance of the current set of rules, it is crucial to compare the key metrics—particularly **confidence** and **lift**—with the baseline metrics from previous iterations. This comparison helps determine whether the current rules have improved in predictive capability and whether further refinement is necessary.

---

**Comparison of Metrics**

**Previous Metrics (Baseline Averages)**

- **Train Support**: 0.1667 to 0.1845
- **Train Confidence**: 0.5396 to 0.6352
- **Train Lift**: 1.0559 to 1.2048
- **Train Leverage**: 0.0289 to -0.0041

**Current Metrics**

- **Train Support**: 0.0190
- **Train Confidence**: 0.6361
- **Train Lift**: 1.2612
- **Train Leverage**: 0.0035

---

**Detailed Analysis**

1. **Support**

   - **Observation**: The current train support is **0.0190**, significantly lower than the previous range of **0.1667 to 0.1845**.
   - **Implication**: A lower support indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller fraction of the dataset. While high support is desirable for broader applicability, very low support may mean the rules are too specific.

2. **Confidence**

   - **Observation**: The current train confidence is **0.6361**, marginally higher than the previous maximum of **0.6352**.
   - **Implication**: This suggests that when the rule conditions are met, there is a **63.61%** chance that the prediction of high yield is correct. Slight improvement indicates better precision of the rules.

3. **Lift**

   - **Observation**: The current train lift is **1.2612**, exceeding the previous maximum of **1.2048**.
   - **Implication**: A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is effective in identifying instances with higher than average likelihood of high yield. The increased lift reflects stronger association between the rule conditions and the high yield outcome.

4. **Leverage**

   - **Observation**: The current train leverage is **0.0035**, which is lower than the previous positive leverage but higher than the negative values.
   - **Implication**: Positive leverage suggests that the rule predicts high yield better than random chance. However, the small value indicates only a slight improvement over expected support.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency**

- The **increase in confidence and lift**, although slight, suggests that the predictive power of the rules has improved.
- The **significant decrease in support** raises concern that the rules have become too **narrow or specialized**, capturing fewer cases.
- The balance between confidence, lift, and support is crucial. High confidence and lift are valuable, but not at the expense of extremely low support.
- The current metrics may indicate that a **local minimum** has been reached, where further iterations without strategic changes may not yield substantial improvements.
- The consistency in confidence and lift over multiple iterations, along with declining support, suggests that the **algorithm may be overfitting** to specific instances in the training data.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Broaden Rule Applicability**

   - **Action**: Re-express some rules to encompass a wider range of modifiers without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
   - **Rationale**: Increasing support will make the rules more useful in practical applications by covering more cases.

2. **Optimize Rule Complexity**

   - **Action**: Simplify overly complex rules that may be too restrictive.
   - **Rationale**: Simplification can prevent overfitting and improve generalizability to new data.

3. **Re-evaluate Rule Conditions**

   - **Action**: Identify overlapping or redundant rules and consider merging them.
   - **Rationale**: Consolidating similar rules can increase support while maintaining or improving confidence and lift.

4. **Incorporate Additional Data**

   - **Action**: If possible, expand the dataset with more examples of modifiers and their corresponding yields.
   - **Rationale**: A larger dataset can provide more instances for rule validation and reduce the impact of anomalies.

5. **Adjust Thresholds for Yield Classification**

   - **Action**: Reassess the criteria for what constitutes high and low yield (e.g., adjusting percentage cutoffs).
   - **Rationale**: Modifying thresholds may balance the distribution of high and low yield instances, influencing support and confidence.

6. **Cross-Validation**

   - **Action**: Perform cross-validation using a separate test set to evaluate rule performance.
   - **Rationale**: Testing rules on unseen data helps determine if high confidence and lift are maintained beyond the training set.

7. **Feature Importance Analysis**

   - **Action**: Analyze which molecular features contribute most to high confidence and lift.
   - **Rationale**: Focusing on impactful features can guide the refinement of rules for better performance.

8. **Incorporate Negative Examples**

   - **Action**: Ensure that the rules account for modifiers that lead to low yield to improve discrimination.
   - **Rationale**: Balancing positive and negative instances enhances the rules' ability to differentiate between outcomes.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules exhibits slightly improved **confidence** and **lift**, indicating a stronger predictive capability when the rules apply. However, the markedly reduced **support** suggests that the rules cover a minimal portion of the dataset, limiting practical usefulness. To enhance the performance and applicability of the rules:

- **Balance Specificity and Generality**: Aim for rules that are specific enough to be accurate but general enough to apply to a meaningful subset of data.
- **Prevent Overfitting**: Avoid making rules so tailored to the training data that they fail to generalize.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continue refining the rules with attention to support, ensuring that improvements in confidence and lift do not come at the cost of applicability.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can achieve a better balance between predictive performance and coverage, leading to more robust and practical guidelines for predicting catalyst performance in the target chemical reactions.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results and comparison with previous metrics, we can evaluate the performance of the current rules used to generate the feature matrix for predicting the loading of modifiers on the catalyst.

1. **Accuracy Metrics Comparison**:

   - **Previous Metrics**:
     - **Validation Accuracies**: Consistently around **0.76**.
     - **Test Accuracies**: **0.75** and **0.625**.
     - **Observation**: The previous rules maintained a relatively high and stable accuracy on both validation and test sets.

   - **Current Metrics**:
     - **Validation Accuracy (5-fold)**: **0.6**.
     - **Observation**: There is a significant decrease in validation accuracy compared to previous metrics.

2. **Effectiveness of Current Rules**:

   - The decrease in validation accuracy from **0.76** to **0.6** suggests that the current set of rules is **less effective** than the previous ones.
   - The model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data has diminished, indicating potential issues with the rules leading to **underfitting** or **overfitting**.

3. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment**:

   - **Underfitting**:
     - The drop in validation accuracy may indicate that the model is **underfitting**, meaning it is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data due to overly generalized rules.
   - **Overfitting**:
     - If the training accuracy remains high while validation accuracy drops, the model may be **overfitting**, memorizing the training data but failing to generalize.
   - **Conclusion**:
     - The decrease suggests a need to **refine the rules** to better capture the complexities of the data without over-complicating the model.

4. **SHAP Analysis and Discrepancy Identification**:

   By analyzing the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, we can identify which rules are contributing most to the incorrect predictions.

   - **Overestimation Cases** (Predicted loading **high**, Experimental value **low**):

     - **Molecule**: *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
       - **SHAP Values**:
         - **Rule12**: **0.3074** (Highest positive contribution)
         - **Rule4**: **0.0349**
         - **Rule14**: **0.0052**
         - **Rule2**: **0.0**
       - **Interpretation**: **Rule12** is significantly contributing to the incorrect high prediction.

     - **Molecule**: *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*
       - **SHAP Values**:
         - Similar pattern with high contributions from **Rule4** and **Rule14**.

   - **Underestimation Cases** (Predicted loading **low**, Experimental value **high**):

     - **Molecule**: *COC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C(=O)CCC(=O)O)OC*
       - **SHAP Values**:
         - **Rule12**: **-0.0623** (Negative contribution)
         - **Rule14**: **-0.1904** (Significant negative contribution)
         - **Rule4**: **0.0200**
       - **Interpretation**: **Rule14** is contributing to the incorrect low prediction.

5. **Analysis of Rules Based on SHAP Values**:

   - **Rule12**:
     - Contributes significantly to overestimations in some molecules.
     - Has both positive and negative SHAP values across different molecules, indicating inconsistency.
     - May be too broad or not specific enough, capturing molecules that do not fit the intended pattern.

   - **Rule14**:
     - Shows high negative SHAP values in cases where the model underestimates the loading.
     - May be overly penalizing certain molecular features leading to low predicted loading.

   - **Rule4**:
     - Contributes positively in some cases but negatively in others.
     - Might need refinement to reduce misclassifications.

   - **Rule2**:
     - SHAP values are **0.0** in many cases, suggesting minimal impact.
     - May not be effectively contributing to the model's predictions.

6. **Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**:

   - The decrease in accuracy indicates that the current rules are not improving the model's performance.
   - The shift in accuracy suggests that the current set of rules might have introduced complexity that doesn't enhance predictive power or fails to capture essential patterns.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the performance of the model, we should consider refining and adjusting the current rules based on the insights from the SHAP analysis.

1. **Refine Rule12** (**Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**):

   - **Issue**:
     - Rule12 is contributing to overestimations where the experimental values are low.
     - This suggests that the rule is too **inclusive**, capturing modifiers that do not result in high loading.

   - **Recommendations**:
     - **Specify Side Chains**: Narrow down the types of aromatic side chains with donor heteroatoms that truly lead to high yield.
     - **Introduce Exceptions**: Identify exceptions where the presence of donor heteroatoms does not contribute positively and adjust the rule accordingly.
     - **Consider Steric Effects**: Incorporate considerations of steric hindrance that may prevent effective coordination despite the presence of donor heteroatoms.

2. **Adjust Rule4** (**Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**):

   - **Issue**:
     - Rule4 contributes to both overestimations and underestimations.
     - The rule may be too **broad**, not accounting for modifiers where aldehyde groups do not negatively impact the yield.

   - **Recommendations**:
     - **Refine the Scope**: Limit the rule to specific positions or contexts where aldehyde groups interfere with catalyst performance.
     - **Add Structural Conditions**: Include additional structural criteria that must be met for the rule to apply, such as the absence of other functional groups that can mitigate the negative effects.
     - **Create Sub-Rules**: Divide Rule4 into sub-rules that handle different scenarios separately, improving specificity.

3. **Evaluate Rule14** (**Modifiers with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids Substituted with Heterocyclic Rings Lead to Variable Yield Based on Coordination Ability**):

   - **Issue**:
     - High negative SHAP values in underestimation cases indicate that the rule may be incorrectly predicting low yield for modifiers that actually result in high yield.
     - The rule's condition of "variable yield" may be causing inconsistency in predictions.

   - **Recommendations**:
     - **Clarify Coordination Ability**: More precisely define what constitutes effective coordination ability within heterocyclic rings.
     - **Differentiate Heterocycles**: Categorize heterocyclic rings based on their donor atoms and electronic properties, and adjust the rule to reflect these differences.
     - **Update Prediction Outcome**: Modify the rule to be more predictive (i.e., specify conditions under which the yield is high or low, rather than stating 'variable yield').

4. **Review Rule2** (**Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituted Electron-Donating Amino Groups Lead to High Yield**):

   - **Issue**:
     - Minimal impact on model predictions as indicated by SHAP values of **0.0**.
     - The rule may not be contributing effectively to distinguishing high yield modifiers.

   - **Recommendations**:
     - **Reassess the Rule's Relevance**: Determine if the structural feature described is prevalent in the dataset and if it correlates with high yield.
     - **Enhance Rule Conditions**: Include additional structural or electronic criteria to improve the rule's specificity and impact.
     - **Consider Removal**: If the rule does not contribute meaningfully, it may be prudent to remove it to simplify the model.

5. **General Improvements**:

   - **Data Analysis**:
     - Re-examine the dataset for class imbalances or mislabeled data that could affect model performance.
     - Ensure the training and validation sets are representative of the entire dataset.

   - **Rule Overlap and Conflicts**:
     - Identify any overlapping or conflicting rules that might confuse the model.
     - **Consolidate Rules**: Merge similar rules or resolve conflicts by establishing hierarchy or precedence among them.

   - **Enhance Generalization**:
     - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: Overly intricate rules may cause overfitting. Simplify rules where possible without losing essential information.
     - **Introduce New Relevant Features**: If certain influential molecular features are not captured by the current rules, consider developing new rules to include them.

6. **Use Insights from SHAP Analysis**:

   - **Target Specific Misclassifications**:
     - Focus on molecules where predictions are incorrect and SHAP values are high in magnitude.
     - Investigate why certain rules are contributing strongly to these misclassifications.

   - **Iterative Refinement**:
     - After modifying the rules, retrain the model and reassess the performance.
     - Repeat the SHAP analysis to observe the effects of the changes on model predictions.

   - **Balance Rule Complexity**:
     - Strive for a balance between rule complexity and generalization ability.
     - Avoid adding overly specific rules that only fit a few data points unless they represent critical exceptions.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules appears to be less effective than previous iterations, as evidenced by the decrease in validation accuracy. The SHAP analysis has identified **Rule12**, **Rule14**, **Rule4**, and **Rule2** as key areas for improvement. By refining these rules to be more specific, adjusting their conditions, or reassessing their inclusion in the model, we can address the misclassifications and improve overall model performance.

It is recommended to focus on:

- **Refining rules that contribute to overestimations**, particularly **Rule12** and **Rule14**.
- **Adjusting rules that contribute to underestimations**, ensuring they accurately represent the underlying chemical principles.
- **Improving generalization** by balancing rule specificity and complexity.
- **Continuing iterative evaluation** using SHAP analysis to monitor the impact of changes.

By implementing these recommendations, we can enhance the predictive power of the model and achieve better alignment between predicted and experimental values.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has been evaluated based on performance metrics, accuracy, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis. The key observations from the discussions are:

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Confidence and Lift**: There is a slight improvement in confidence (from ~63.5% to 63.6%) and lift (from ~1.20 to 1.26), indicating a marginal increase in the predictive power of the rules when they apply.
   - **Support**: A significant decrease in train support (from ~17% to 1.9%) suggests that the current rules are too specific and apply to a very small portion of the dataset.

2. **Accuracy and SHAP Analysis**:
   - **Validation Accuracy**: The validation accuracy has decreased from 76% in previous iterations to 60%, indicating reduced model performance.
   - **SHAP Values**: Certain rules, notably **Rule 12** and **Rule 14**, contribute significantly to incorrect predictions. High SHAP values in misclassified cases suggest these rules may be too broad or mis-specified.

3. **Rule-Specific Issues**:
   - **Rule 1**: The pattern requires both a carboxylic acid and a carboxylate anion simultaneously, which is chemically unrealistic.
   - **Rule 2**: Has minimal impact on predictions, as indicated by zero SHAP values.
   - **Rule 9**: The pattern for long aliphatic chains may not effectively capture relevant modifiers.

4. **Suggestions for Optimization**:
   - **Pattern Refinement**: Adjust SMARTS patterns to accurately reflect the chemical features described in the rules.
   - **Logical Operations**: Implement logical OR conditions within rules where appropriate.
   - **Rule Complexity**: Simplify overly complex rules to prevent overfitting.
   - **Rule Comprehensiveness**: Broaden rules to increase applicability without sacrificing predictive power.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Modify Rule 1**:
   - **Issue**: Requiring both carboxylic acid and carboxylate anion patterns simultaneously is unrealistic.
   - **Improvement**: Use a single pattern that matches either form, such as `[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]`, to represent the carboxyl group in both protonated and deprotonated states. Ensure the pattern includes the primary amine group logic.

2. **Implement Logical OR in Pattern Matching**:
   - **Issue**: Current code combines all patterns with logical AND, which may be too restrictive.
   - **Improvement**: Adjust code to allow logical OR between certain patterns within a rule. This could involve combining SMARTS patterns using commas or implementing conditional logic in the pattern matching function.

3. **Revise Rule 9 Pattern**:
   - **Issue**: The pattern `'[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]'` may not capture all long-chain aliphatic acids.
   - **Improvement**: Use a recursive SMARTS pattern like `'CCCCC'` or `'[CH2]{5,}'` to match chains of six or more carbons. Ensure that exclude patterns effectively filter out molecules with additional functional groups.

4. **Refine Rules 11 and 12**:
   - **Issue**: Difficulty distinguishing between amino acids with and without donor heteroatoms in side chains.
   - **Improvement**: Develop specific patterns that detect aromatic rings containing donor heteroatoms like nitrogen or oxygen for Rule 12, and exclude such features in Rule 11.

5. **Update SMARTS Patterns for Functional Groups**:
   - **Issue**: Patterns may not accurately represent the intended chemical features.
   - **Improvement**: Review and correct SMARTS patterns for all functional groups, ensuring they match the chemical structures described in the rules.

6. **Debugging Mechanism**:
   - **Issue**: Lack of visibility into which patterns are matched.
   - **Improvement**: Implement code that logs or outputs which patterns are matched for each molecule, aiding in troubleshooting and validation.

7. **Adjust Rule 14 Pattern**:
   - **Issue**: The pattern `'[a][n,O,S]'` may be too broad.
   - **Improvement**: Create more specific patterns targeting particular heterocycles known to coordinate effectively, such as pyrazole or pyridine rings, and adjust the rule accordingly.

8. **Utilize Exclude Patterns Effectively**:
   - **Issue**: Exclude patterns may not be accurately negating incorrect matches.
   - **Improvement**: Verify and update exclude patterns to ensure they represent structures that should not match the rule.

9. **Standardize Logical Operations**:
   - **Issue**: Inconsistency in how patterns are combined.
   - **Improvement**: Decide on a consistent method for combining patterns (either logical AND or OR) and apply it uniformly across all rules.

10. **Re-evaluate Rules with SHAP Analysis**:
    - **Issue**: Certain rules significantly contribute to misclassifications.
    - **Improvement**: Specifically reassess **Rule 12** and **Rule 14** for over-generalization or mis-specification, and refine them to improve predictive accuracy.

**Assessment of Further Optimization Possibility**

Yes, there is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The issues identified suggest that adjustments to the pattern matching logic, refinement of SMARTS patterns, and reevaluation of rule specificity can enhance model performance. By carefully broadening the applicability of rules and ensuring patterns accurately reflect the intended chemical features, it is possible to improve the predictive power of the model while maintaining generalizability.

    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid and Free Primary Amino Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain both a free primary amino group (**–NH₂**) and at least one carboxyl group (**–COOH**), especially when the molecule is an amino acid with aliphatic or heteroaromatic side chains containing donor heteroatoms.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Donor heteroatoms in the side chain (e.g., nitrogen in an indole ring) can further enhance coordination, increasing catalyst stability and activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Example**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituted Halogen Atoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with halogen atoms such as bromine (**–Br**).

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Halogen substituents can affect the electronic properties of the aromatic ring and may enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group, improving coordination with the metal catalyst. The halogen can also engage in secondary interactions that stabilize the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups (**–CHO**) attached directly to the aromatic ring, particularly at positions ortho or para to the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are susceptible to oxidation and can interact unfavorably with the catalyst, potentially deactivating it or leading to side reactions. They may also interfere with metal coordination due to competing binding sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers Containing Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups (**–OH**) in vicinal (adjacent) positions, either in aliphatic chains or aromatic systems.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups can chelate metal centers, forming stable complexes that enhance catalyst performance. This chelation increases binding affinity and can protect the metal center from deactivation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Atoms Adjacent to Carboxyl Group Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group at the 3-position relative to the nitrogen atom in the ring.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The nitrogen atom in the heteroaromatic ring provides an additional coordination site, and its proximity to the carboxyl group facilitates the formation of chelate complexes with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Perfluorinated Carboxylic Acids Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains, where all hydrogens in the alkyl chain are replaced with fluorine atoms.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, reducing the solubility of the modifier in the reaction medium and diminishing interactions with the catalyst. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can decrease the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Terminal Ether Groups or Polyether Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing ether linkages (**–O–**) at terminal positions or along the carbon chain, especially polyether chains without terminal hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms have lone pairs that are less available for coordination due to their position within the molecule, and they may not effectively interact with metal centers. Polyether chains can introduce flexibility and entropic factors that reduce binding affinity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with carbon chains of six or more carbons and no additional functional groups like amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Long hydrophobic chains can enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, while the terminal carboxyl group remains available for metal coordination. The lack of additional functional groups prevents interference with catalyst binding.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield; amino group may form internal hydrogen bonds or coordinate differently)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield; hydroxyl group may engage in competing interactions)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide linkages (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group, particularly when the amide is connected to an aromatic ring or involved in conjugation.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups can delocalize electron density through resonance, reducing the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen for coordination. This delocalization can decrease the binding affinity to metal centers.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Amino Acids with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains Lacking Donor Heteroatoms Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains without heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., phenyl groups).

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Bulky side chains can cause steric hindrance, impeding access to the metal center. The absence of donor heteroatoms means fewer coordination sites, reducing interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole rings) capable of coordinating with metal centers.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Heteroatoms in the side chain provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and potentially stabilizing catalytic intermediates.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Sulfhydryl Groups in Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing sulfhydryl (**–SH**) groups on short aliphatic chains along with carboxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal coordination due to the lone pair on sulfur. Short chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing effective interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield; aromatic ring may introduce steric hindrance or reduce sulfur availability)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids Substituted with Heterocyclic Rings Lead to Variable Yield Based on Coordination Ability**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with heterocyclic rings; the yield depends on the presence of donor atoms in the heterocycle capable of effective metal coordination.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Heterocycles with available lone pairs (e.g., pyrazole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction. Heterocycles lacking such features may not contribute to coordination and can introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**; pyridine nitrogen may be less available due to steric factors or electron delocalization)

  - **Prediction**:
    - **Modifiers with coordinating heterocycles** will result in **high yield**.
    - **Modifiers without effective coordination** will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Conjugated Ketone Groups in Aromatic Systems Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups conjugated within the aromatic system, enhancing electron delocalization.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Conjugated ketone groups can participate in resonance structures, increasing the electron density on coordinating atoms and providing additional sites for metal interaction, which can stabilize the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully formulated to reflect the relationships between molecular structures of modifiers and their impact on the reaction yield. The rules combine multiple functional groups and sub-structures to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different features influence catalyst performance. Each rule is grounded in physico-chemical principles, considering electronic effects, coordination chemistry, and steric factors.

- **Coverage**: The rules address a broad spectrum of functional groups present in the dataset, ensuring applicability to various modifiers.

- **Chemical Rationale**: Each rule is supported by underlying chemical principles that explain the observed effects on yield.

- **Predictive Power**: By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural features.

- **Balance**: The rules maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity, with some rules offering broader coverage and others addressing specific cases with detailed features.

These refined rules improve upon the initial set by providing clearer guidelines, eliminating less effective rules, and focusing on the most significant structural factors influencing the reaction outcome. They serve as valuable tools for guiding future experiments and optimizing reaction conditions in the context of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Modify Rule 1 SMARTS Pattern to Accurately Represent Carboxyl Groups**

  - **Issue**: In **Rule 1**, requiring both carboxylic acid and carboxylate anion patterns simultaneously is chemically unrealistic.
  - **Improvement**: Use a single SMARTS pattern that matches the carboxyl group in both protonated and deprotonated forms. Replace the current patterns with `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` to represent the carboxyl group effectively. Ensure that the primary amine group is included using an appropriate pattern like `[NH2]`, and combine these patterns using logical **AND** within the rule.

- **Advice 2**: **Implement Logical OR Operations Within Pattern Matching**

  - **Issue**: Current implementation combines all sub-patterns within a rule using logical **AND**, which may be too restrictive.
  - **Improvement**: Adjust the code to allow logical **OR** operations between certain sub-patterns within a rule. For example, in cases where a modifier can have either functional group A **OR** functional group B, modify the pattern matching function to accept a list of patterns that are combined using logical **OR**. This can be achieved by using the comma operator in SMARTS patterns or by programming logic that checks for any of the specified patterns.

- **Advice 3**: **Revise Rule 9 Pattern to Capture Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**

  - **Issue**: The existing pattern in **Rule 9** (`'[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]'`) may not capture all relevant modifiers with long aliphatic chains.
  - **Improvement**: Use a recursive SMARTS pattern to represent straight-chain aliphatic acids with six or more carbons. For example, use `'CCCCCCC'` or `'[CH2]{6,}-C(=O)[O;H1]'` to match carbon chains of six or more methylene units ending with a carboxylic acid group. Ensure that exclude patterns effectively filter out molecules with additional functional groups like hydroxyl or amino groups.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rules 11 and 12 to Differentiate Side Chains with or without Donor Heteroatoms**

  - **Issue**: Difficulty in distinguishing amino acids with and without donor heteroatoms in side chains, impacting **Rules 11** and **12**.
  - **Improvement**:
    - For **Rule 12** (Amino acids with aromatic side chains containing donor heteroatoms leading to high yield), create SMARTS patterns that specifically detect aromatic rings with heteroatoms capable of metal coordination. For example, use patterns like `'[c][n]`' to detect indole rings or `'c1ccncc1'` for pyridine rings.
    - For **Rule 11** (Amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains lacking donor heteroatoms leading to low yield), ensure the pattern detects aromatic rings without donor heteroatoms, such as phenyl groups, using patterns like `'c1ccccc1'`. Exclude patterns should be added to prevent matching modifiers with heteroatoms in the side chain.

- **Advice 5**: **Update SMARTS Patterns for Functional Groups Across All Rules**

  - **Issue**: Some SMARTS patterns may not accurately represent the intended chemical features, leading to incorrect matches.
  - **Improvement**: Review and correct SMARTS patterns for all functional groups to ensure they are chemically accurate. Check for correct atom types, hybridization states, charges, and bonding. For example, ensure that hydroxyl groups are represented as `[OX2H]`, primary amines as `[NX3;H2]`, and carboxyl groups as `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`.

- **Advice 6**: **Implement a Debugging Mechanism to Log Matched Patterns**

  - **Issue**: Lack of visibility into which patterns are matched makes it difficult to troubleshoot and validate rules.
  - **Improvement**: Modify the pattern matching code to log or output which SMARTS patterns are matched for each molecule. This can be done by printing the rule number, molecule name, and matched substructures during execution. This debugging information will help identify incorrect pattern matches and allow for timely adjustments.

- **Advice 7**: **Adjust Rule 14 Pattern to Target Specific Heterocycles**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern in **Rule 14** (`'[a][n,O,S]'`) may be too broad, capturing unintended molecules.
  - **Improvement**: Create more specific SMARTS patterns targeting heterocycles known for effective metal coordination. For example, to match modifiers containing pyrazole rings, use `'c1cn[nH]c1'`; for pyridine rings, use `'c1ccncc1'`. Refine the rule to focus on heterocycles with donor atoms in positions that facilitate coordination with the metal center.

- **Advice 8**: **Verify and Update Exclude Patterns to Prevent False Positives**

  - **Issue**: Exclude patterns may not accurately negate incorrect matches, leading to false positives.
  - **Improvement**: Review exclude patterns for each rule to ensure they effectively block molecules that should not match the rule. Use precise SMARTS patterns to represent the undesired features. For example, in **Rule 9**, exclude modifiers with hydroxyl groups using an exclude pattern like `'[OX2H][CH2]'`.

- **Advice 9**: **Standardize Logical Operations Across All Rules**

  - **Issue**: Inconsistency in combining patterns within rules may cause confusion and incorrect matches.
  - **Improvement**: Decide on a consistent method for combining patterns within each rule. For instance, use logical **AND** to require all specified features be present, or logical **OR** when any one of several features suffices. Clearly document this methodology and apply it uniformly across all rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Re-evaluate Rules 12 and 14 Based on SHAP Analysis**

  - **Issue**: SHAP analysis indicates that **Rules 12** and **14** significantly contribute to misclassifications.
  - **Improvement**: Reassess these rules for over-generalization or mis-specification. Refine **Rule 12** to ensure it only includes amino acids with aromatic side chains containing donor heteroatoms that effectively coordinate with the metal. Similarly, adjust **Rule 14** to be more specific in identifying heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with strong coordination ability, possibly by specifying certain heterocycles and excluding others.

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituted Amino Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with amino groups (**–NH₂**), enhancing electron donation to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amino groups are strong electron donors and can coordinate with metal centers, increasing electron density and facilitating catalyst interaction.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups (**–CHO**) attached directly to the aromatic ring, particularly at positions ortho or para to the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can form undesirable side products or deactivate the catalyst by interacting unfavorably with the metal center, reducing overall yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)

The absence of additional functional groups prevents interference with catalyst binding.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield; hydroxyl group may engage in competing interactions)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield; amino group may interfere with binding)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers Containing Sulfhydryl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that possess a sulfhydryl group (**–SH**) on a short aliphatic chain along with a carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal coordination due to the lone pair on sulfur. Short chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing effective interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield; the aromatic ring may hinder sulfur coordination due to steric or electronic factors)

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Structural Features in the Rules**

  Transform the qualitative descriptions in the current rules into quantifiable structural features that can be extracted from the SMILES representations. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid and Free Primary Amino Groups on Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield," specify numeric counts such as:

  - Number of carboxyl groups
  - Number of primary amino groups
  - Length of aliphatic chains (number of carbons)
  
  This quantification allows for the creation of a numerical feature matrix where each feature corresponds to a specific, measurable property.

- **Advice 2**: **Develop a Standardized Feature Extraction Protocol**

  Create a standardized protocol for extracting features from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit). Define a set of descriptors relevant to the reaction yield, such as:

  - Molecular weight
  - Topological polar surface area (TPSA)
  - Number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors
  - LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient)
  - Number of rotatable bonds
  - Presence of specific functional groups (binary flags)

  This approach ensures consistency in data processing and facilitates the generation of a comprehensive numerical feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Multivariate Analysis to Refine Rules**

  Utilize statistical methods like principal component analysis (PCA) or multiple regression to identify the most significant features affecting the yield. By analyzing the numerical data, you can refine the rules to focus on the key predictors, improving their accuracy and practicality.

- **Advice 4**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**

  Review the current rules for overlap and redundancy. For example, Rules 1 and 8 both mention aliphatic carboxylic acids, but with different additional groups. Consolidate them into a more general rule with quantifiable parameters, such as:

  - "Modifiers with aliphatic chains of X carbons and Y functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) lead to high yield when the count of coordinating atoms is above Z."

  This simplification aids in numerical representation and reduces complexity.

- **Advice 5**: **Define Binary and Continuous Features**

  Classify features as binary (presence or absence of a functional group) or continuous (chain length, number of functional groups). This classification allows for the use of different modeling techniques and improves the flexibility of the numerical feature matrix.

- **Advice 6**: **Use Substructure Fingerprints for Feature Generation**

  Employ molecular fingerprinting methods to encode the presence of specific substructures or motifs within the modifiers. Fingerprints can be used to generate a high-dimensional binary feature matrix suitable for machine learning models.

- **Advice 7**: **Integrate Electronic and Steric Parameters**

  Calculate electronic properties (e.g., partial charges, HOMO-LUMO gap) and steric parameters (e.g., molecular volume, steric hindrance descriptors) that may influence catalyst interaction and reaction yield. Including these parameters in the numerical matrix enhances the model's ability to capture subtle effects.

- **Advice 8**: **Automate Feature Extraction with Scripts**

  Develop or utilize existing scripts to automate the feature extraction process from SMILES strings. Automation reduces the potential for human error and ensures that all modifiers are processed uniformly, improving data reliability.

- **Advice 9**: **Re-express Rules as Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPR)**

  Shift from qualitative rules to quantitative models that correlate specific molecular descriptors with reaction yield. This approach leverages statistical modeling to predict yields based on measurable properties, facilitating optimization.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Update Rules Based on Data Analysis**

  After generating the numerical feature matrix, perform data analysis to validate the existing rules. Use techniques like cross-validation to assess the predictive power of each rule. Refine or discard rules that do not show strong correlations with the yield, and update them based on empirical findings.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituted Electron-Donating Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups such as amino (**–NH₂**) or hydroxy (**–OH**) groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring and the carboxylate group, enhancing coordination with metal centers. They may also stabilize catalytic intermediates through resonance effects.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**; despite being an electron-withdrawing group, nitro can engage in coordination)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield; aldehyde group is electron-withdrawing and may deactivate catalysts)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Compound **30**, Low Yield; shorter aliphatic chain may affect coordination)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with Heterocyclic Aromatic Carboxylic Acids Containing Nitrogen Atoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms, such as pyridine or pyrazole rings.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, enhancing binding with metal centers. The aromatic system maintains rigidity and planarity, promoting effective orbital overlap.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**, Low Yield; steric hindrance or electronic factors may impede coordination)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**, provided the nitrogen is accessible for metal coordination.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have multiple hydroxyl (**–OH**) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group, forming polyol structures either in aliphatic chains or cyclic forms.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal centers, enhancing binding affinity and stability of the catalyst complex. They also increase solubility in polar solvents, improving interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers Containing Sulfhydryl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that possess a sulfhydryl group (**–SH**) on a short aliphatic chain in addition to a carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal coordination due to the lone pair on sulfur. Short chains allow for effective interaction without significant steric hindrance.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield; the aromatic ring may limit sulfur accessibility or affect electronic properties unfavorably)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have aldehyde groups (**–CHO**) directly attached to the aromatic ring or adjacent to the carboxylic acid group.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are highly reactive and can form undesired side reactions or irreversibly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst and reducing yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where the alkyl chain is extensively fluorinated, replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative and lipophobic, reducing interactions with both the catalyst and the solvent. Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect diminishes the coordinating ability of functional groups.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Ether Linkages in Aliphatic Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain internal ether linkages (**–O–**) within their aliphatic chains, particularly polyether structures.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms are less available for coordination due to their positioning within flexible chains. This flexibility can decrease binding affinity to metal centers due to entropic penalties.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Amide Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide bonds (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group or within the main chain.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups can engage in resonance, reducing the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for metal coordination. This can decrease the interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Compound **23**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Long Aliphatic Chains Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of six or more carbons and no additional functional groups like amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate. The terminal carboxyl group remains available for metal coordination without interference from other groups.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield; hydroxyl group may lead to unwanted side interactions)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield; amino group may interfere with proper coordination)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Amino acid modifiers with aromatic side chains that include heteroatoms capable of coordinating with metal centers, such as the indole nitrogen in tryptophan.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Donor heteroatoms in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and potentially stabilizing reactive intermediates.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield; lacks a coordinating heteroatom in the side chain)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed to illustrate the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their effects on the reaction yield. They combine multiple substructures and functional groups to provide comprehensive guidelines:

- **Coverage**: The rules encompass a wide range of structural features present in the dataset, including various functional groups, ring systems, and chain lengths.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Each rule is grounded in chemical principles, such as coordination chemistry, electronic effects, steric factors, and solubility, explaining why certain features lead to high or low yields.

- **Balance**: The set includes both broad rules with wide applicability and more specific rules that address particular structural features, striking a balance between simplicity and complexity.

By applying these rules, predictions can be made regarding the effectiveness of potential modifiers based on their molecular structures. This can guide the selection and design of modifiers to optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is well-defined, combining the presence of primary amino and carboxylic acid groups on short aliphatic chains (fewer than six carbons) to predict high yield. The rule is clear, provides solid physico-chemical insight about coordination enhancing interaction with the catalyst, considers multiple substructures, and is supported by multiple examples (Compounds 0, 2, 3) and counterexamples (Compounds 31, 34), meeting the criteria of clarity, property insight, complexity, coverage, and balance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 has inconsistencies between its description and examples, affecting clarity and property insight. The rule states that para-substituted electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids lead to high yield. However, it includes **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound 21) as an example, which contains a nitro group—an electron-withdrawing group—not electron-donating. This contradiction undermines the rule's clarity and suggests that additional factors may influence yield, indicating the need for refinement of the rule.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and provides strong physico-chemical insight by focusing on heterocyclic aromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms, which enhance metal coordination. It considers combinations of substructures (heteroaromatic rings with carboxyl groups) and is supported by multiple examples (Compounds 8, 16, 22) and a counterexample (Compound 12), satisfying the criteria of clarity, property insight, complexity, coverage, and balance.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 effectively combines multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids to predict high yield, providing clear physico-chemical reasoning about chelation and increased solubility. While the rule is clear and considers complex substructures, it is supported by only two data points (Compounds 6, 9). Although it meets the minimum coverage criterion, the limited number of examples may affect the rule's robustness and general applicability.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 has limited coverage, with only one supporting example (Compound 18) and one counterexample (Compound 10). While the rule is clear and offers physico-chemical insight about sulfhydryl groups enhancing metal coordination, the minimal data support and narrow focus reduce its reliability. The rule may not be widely applicable without additional supporting data.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and provides adequate physico-chemical insight by explaining how aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids can deactivate catalysts. It considers combinations of functional groups and is supported by multiple examples (Compounds 19, 20), fulfilling the criteria of clarity, property insight, complexity, coverage, and balance.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 lacks sufficient coverage, relying on a single example (Compound 14) to predict that perfluorinated alkyl chains lead to low yield. Although the physico-chemical reasoning is sound, the minimal data support limits the rule's validity and applicability. Additional examples are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is well-defined and supported by multiple examples (Compounds 11, 32) showing that ether linkages in aliphatic chains lead to low yield. The rule provides clear physico-chemical insight about entropic penalties and reduced metal coordination, and considers specific structural features, meeting the criteria of clarity, property insight, complexity, coverage, and balance.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 effectively combines the presence of amide groups adjacent to carboxylic acids to predict low yield, offering physico-chemical reasoning about resonance effects reducing coordination ability. It is supported by multiple examples (Compounds 23, 26, 33) and meets all the criteria, making it a robust and reliable rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10, while clear, has limited coverage and insufficient data support, relying primarily on one positive example (Compound 5) and counterexamples (Compounds 29, 31). The physico-chemical insight provided is minimal, and the rule may oversimplify the effects of long aliphatic chains without considering other contributing factors. This limits the rule's reliability and suggests a need for further investigation and refinement.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is narrowly focused, with limited coverage supported by only one example (Compound 15) and one counterexample (Compound 13). While it provides plausible physico-chemical insight about donor heteroatoms in aromatic side chains enhancing coordination, the minimal data support reduces confidence in the rule's general applicability. Additional examples are needed to validate and strengthen this rule.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Revise Rule 2 to Correct Inconsistencies and Improve Clarity**

  - **Issue**: Rule 2 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups lead to high yield, but includes **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound 21) as an example. Nitro groups are electron-withdrawing, which contradicts the rule's description.

  - **Recommendation**: Reevaluate the rule to accurately reflect the observed data. Consider adjusting the rule to focus on the ability of certain substituents, both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing, to engage in coordination with metal centers. Alternatively, split the rule into two separate rules that address the distinct effects of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Enhance Coverage for Rule 5 by Including Additional Examples**

  - **Issue**: Rule 5, regarding modifiers with sulfhydryl groups on short aliphatic chains leading to high yield, lacks sufficient data support, relying on only one positive example (Compound 18) and one counterexample (Compound 10).

  - **Recommendation**: Investigate the dataset for additional compounds with sulfhydryl groups on short aliphatic chains. If such compounds exist, include them as examples or counterexamples to strengthen the rule's validity. If not, consider broadening the rule to encompass similar functional groups or merging it with other rules addressing strong metal-coordinating ligands.

- **Advice 3**: **Improve Rule 7 by Increasing Data Support and Clarifying Scope**

  - **Issue**: Rule 7, which states that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains lead to low yield, is supported by only one example (Compound 14), limiting its reliability.

  - **Recommendation**: Expand the dataset to include more modifiers with perfluorinated chains to test the rule's validity. If additional data is unavailable, consider integrating this rule into a broader rule that encompasses modifiers with highly electronegative or sterically hindering substituents that negatively impact yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Clarify the Role of Terminal Hydroxyl Groups in Rule 8**

  - **Issue**: Rule 8 addresses modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains leading to low yield but does not specify the influence of terminal hydroxyl groups, which may affect coordination.

  - **Recommendation**: Clarify whether the absence of terminal hydroxyl groups is essential for the low yield outcome. If terminal hydroxyl groups improve yield by enhancing coordination, update the rule description to reflect this nuance. Provide examples to illustrate the impact of terminal hydroxyl groups on the modifier's performance.

- **Advice 5**: **Reevaluate Rule 10 Due to Limited Coverage and Oversimplification**

  - **Issue**: Rule 10 claims that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to high yield, but is supported by only one example (Compound 5) and limited counterexamples, potentially oversimplifying the effect of chain length.

  - **Recommendation**: Examine whether chain length alone is a determining factor for high yield or if other structural features contribute significantly. Consider combining this rule with others that address the influence of additional functional groups. Provide more data points to strengthen the rule or adjust it to reflect a more accurate relationship between structure and yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Increase Data Support for Rule 11 to Strengthen Its Validity**

  - **Issue**: Rule 11 focuses on amino acids with aromatic side chains containing donor heteroatoms leading to high yield but is supported by only one example (Compound 15) and one counterexample (Compound 13).

  - **Recommendation**: Seek additional examples of amino acids with aromatic side chains containing donor heteroatoms and determine their impact on yield. Incorporate these findings into the rule to enhance its coverage and reliability. If such data is scarce, consider broadening the rule or integrating it with other rules that address similar coordinating functionalities.

- **Advice 7**: **Merge Similar Rules to Reduce Redundancy and Enhance Comprehensiveness**

  - **Issue**: Some rules, such as Rules 2 and 3, overlap in addressing aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents that affect coordination.

  - **Recommendation**: Combine overlapping rules into a single, more comprehensive rule that encompasses aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents (electron-donating or electron-withdrawing) that enhance metal coordination. Clearly define the scope and provide examples for different types of substituents to improve clarity and usefulness.

- **Advice 8**: **Ensure All Rules Are Supported by Multiple Examples and Counterexamples**

  - **Issue**: Several rules have limited data support, affecting their robustness and predictive power.

  - **Recommendation**: For each rule, aim to include multiple supporting examples and counterexamples from the dataset. This will strengthen the rules' validity and make them more reliable for predicting the outcomes of new modifiers. If necessary, expand the dataset or adjust the rules to better reflect the available data.

- **Advice 9**: **Enhance Physico-Chemical Explanations for Improved Understanding**

  - **Issue**: Some rules, such as Rule 12 on conjugated ketone groups, lack detailed physico-chemical explanations, reducing property insight.

  - **Recommendation**: Provide more comprehensive explanations for the underlying physico-chemical properties that contribute to high or low yields. This will improve the understanding of why certain structural features impact the reaction and aid in the design of new modifiers.

- **Advice 10**: **Review All Rules for Consistency and Correct Any Discrepancies**

  - **Issue**: Inconsistencies and discrepancies between rule descriptions, examples, and counterexamples can cause confusion and reduce the effectiveness of the rules.

  - **Recommendation**: Carefully review each rule to ensure that the descriptions accurately match the provided examples and counterexamples. Correct any errors or contradictions to enhance clarity and reliability. Consistent and accurate rules will be more effective for guiding experimental design.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**, Low Yield; steric hindrance or electronic factors may impede coordination)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**, provided the nitrogen is accessible for metal coordination.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have multiple hydroxyl (**–OH**) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group, forming polyol structures either in aliphatic chains or cyclic forms.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal centers, enhancing binding affinity and stability of the catalyst complex. They also increase solubility in polar solvents, improving interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers Containing Sulfhydryl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that possess a sulfhydryl group (**–SH**) on a short aliphatic chain in addition to a carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal coordination due to the lone pair on sulfur. Short chains allow for effective interaction without significant steric hindrance.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield; the aromatic ring may limit sulfur accessibility or affect electronic properties unfavorably)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have aldehyde groups (**–CHO**) directly attached to the aromatic ring or adjacent to the carboxylic acid group.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are highly reactive and can form undesired side reactions or irreversibly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst and reducing yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers where the alkyl chain is extensively fluorinated, replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative and lipophobic, reducing interactions with both the catalyst and the solvent. Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect diminishes the coordinating ability of functional groups.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Ether Linkages in Aliphatic Chains Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain internal ether linkages (**–O–**) within their aliphatic chains, particularly polyether structures.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms are less available for coordination due to their positioning within flexible chains. This flexibility can decrease binding affinity to metal centers due to entropic penalties.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Amide Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide bonds (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group or within the main chain.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups can engage in resonance, reducing the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for metal coordination. This can decrease the interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Compound **23**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Long Aliphatic Chains Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of six or more carbons and no additional functional groups like amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate. The terminal carboxyl group remains available for metal coordination without interference from other groups.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield; hydroxyl group may lead to unwanted side interactions)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield; amino group may interfere with proper coordination)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Amino acid modifiers with aromatic side chains that include heteroatoms capable of coordinating with metal centers, such as the indole nitrogen in tryptophan.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Donor heteroatoms in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and potentially stabilizing reactive intermediates.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield; lacks a coordinating heteroatom in the side chain)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed to illustrate the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their effects on the reaction yield. They combine multiple substructures and functional groups to provide comprehensive guidelines:

- **Coverage**: The rules encompass a wide range of structural features present in the dataset, including various functional groups, ring systems, and chain lengths.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Each rule is grounded in chemical principles, such as coordination chemistry, electronic effects, steric factors, and solubility, explaining why certain features lead to high or low yields.

- **Balance**: The set includes both broad rules with wide applicability and more specific rules that address particular structural features, striking a balance between simplicity and complexity.

By applying these rules, predictions can be made regarding the effectiveness of potential modifiers based on their molecular structures. This can guide the selection and design of modifiers to optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: For **Rule 1**, update the SMARTS pattern to ensure that the primary amino group and the carboxylic acid group are connected via a short aliphatic chain of fewer than six carbons. This can be achieved by incorporating a chain length constraint in the SMARTS, such as specifying a chain of up to five carbons connecting the amino and carboxyl groups, and ensuring they are terminal groups on the chain.

- **Suggestion 2**: For **Rule 2**, generalize the SMARTS patterns to match any benzoic acid with a para-substituted electron-donating group (e.g., amino or hydroxy), rather than only matching specifically 4-aminobenzoic acid or 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Adjust the SMARTS to identify a carboxylic acid attached to an aromatic ring that has an electron-donating group at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 3**: For **Rule 3**, broaden the SMARTS patterns to capture any heterocyclic aromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms, not just specific examples. The pattern should match any heteroaromatic ring containing nitrogen atoms (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole, pyrimidine) connected to a carboxylic acid group, without specifying exact ring structures.

- **Suggestion 4**: For **Rule 4**, amend the SMARTS pattern to identify any modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acid groups, without restricting to a specific number or exact arrangement of hydroxyl groups. The pattern should detect polyol structures where several hydroxyl groups are in proximity to the carboxylic acid, accommodating varying chain lengths and cyclic forms.

- **Suggestion 5**: For **Rule 5**, adjust the SMARTS pattern to identify modifiers containing sulfhydryl groups on short aliphatic chains (not limited to a specific chain length). Include the chain length constraint (fewer than six carbons) and ensure that both the sulfhydryl group and the carboxylic acid group are connected via this short chain, capturing variations in chain length while maintaining the functional group's proximity.

- **Suggestion 6**: For **Rule 6**, refine the SMARTS pattern to accurately detect modifiers with aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids, whether attached to aromatic rings or aliphatic chains. Modify the pattern to include both scenarios, ensuring it captures aldehyde groups directly connected to the same ring or chain as the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 7**: For **Rule 7**, ensure that the SMARTS pattern for perfluorinated alkyl chains is flexible enough to detect any extensively fluorinated alkyl chain connected to a carboxylic acid, not just the specific example provided. Generalize the pattern to match perfluoroalkyl chains of varying lengths terminating with a carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 8**: For **Rule 8**, generalize the SMARTS pattern to detect ether linkages in aliphatic chains that are connected to carboxylic acid groups, rather than requiring specific substructures. The pattern should identify any internal ether linkages within aliphatic chains leading to a carboxyl group, accounting for different chain lengths and branching.

- **Suggestion 9**: For **Rule 9**, adjust the SMARTS pattern to capture any modifiers with amide groups adjacent to carboxylic acids, including those where the amide is part of the main chain or near the carboxyl group. Expand the pattern to include various positions of the amide group relative to the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 10**: For **Rule 10**, modify the SMARTS pattern to identify long straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (six or more carbons) without additional functional groups. Ensure that the pattern allows for varying longer chain lengths and confirms the absence of other functional groups like amino or hydroxyl groups.

- **Suggestion 11**: For **Rule 11**, broaden the SMARTS pattern to capture any amino acids with aromatic side chains containing donor heteroatoms capable of coordinating with metal centers, not just tryptophan-like structures. Include patterns for other relevant amino acids like histidine or tyrosine, which also have coordinating heteroatoms in their side chains.

- **Suggestion 12**: In general, for all rules, review and revise the SMARTS patterns to be less specific and more representative of the structural descriptions, ensuring that they align with the underlying physico-chemical properties described in the rules rather than specific examples.

- **Suggestion 13**: Test each SMARTS pattern against the provided examples and counterexamples to validate that they correctly predict high or low yields according to the rules. Adjust the patterns based on any discrepancies found during testing to improve their accuracy.

- **Suggestion 14**: Consider using recursive SMARTS or SMARTS with logical operators to capture the necessary structural features more effectively. This approach can help incorporate multiple criteria within a single pattern, such as functional group proximity, chain length, and substitution patterns.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

Upon examining the provided metrics, both from the previous iterations and the current rules, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current set of rules. The focus will be on **confidence** and **lift**, as per the instruction.

---

### **Comparison with Previous Metrics**

#### **Previous Rule Metrics (Baseline Reference):**

- **Train Support**: ~0.1667 to 0.1845 (Average ≈ 0.1756)
- **Train Confidence**: ~0.5396 to 0.6352 (Average ≈ 0.5874)
- **Train Lift**: ~1.0559 to 1.2048 (Average ≈ 1.1304)
- **Train Leverage**: ~-0.0041 to 0.0289 (Average ≈ 0.0124)

#### **Current Rule Metrics (Latest Iteration):**

For individual rules (aggregated summary):

- **Train Support**: Ranges from 0.0 to 0.0686
- **Train Confidence**: Ranges from 0.5 to 0.7318
- **Train Lift**: Ranges from 1.0 to 1.4659
- **Train Leverage**: Ranges from 0.0 to 0.0185

Aggregated metrics (overall performance):

- **Train Support**: 0.0208
- **Train Confidence**: 0.5413
- **Train Lift**: 1.0779
- **Train Leverage**: -0.0003

---

### **Observations**

1. **Support**:
   - **Decrease in Support**: The **train support** for the current rules is significantly lower than the baseline (from ~17.56% to ~2.08%). This suggests that the current rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset.

2. **Confidence**:
   - **Slight Decrease**: The **train confidence** has decreased slightly from an average of ~58.74% to 54.13%. While this is a modest decline, it indicates that the proportion of correct predictions among the cases covered by the rules has slightly worsened.

3. **Lift**:
   - **Marginal Decrease**: The **train lift** has decreased from an average of ~1.1304 to 1.0779. Lift values greater than 1 indicate that the rule is better than random guessing; however, the current lift is only slightly above 1, suggesting a weaker association.

4. **Leverage**:
   - **Decrease to Negative Value**: The **train leverage** has decreased from a positive average (~0.0124) to a slight negative value (-0.0003). Negative leverage indicates that the rule's antecedent and consequent are less likely to occur together than expected by chance.

5. **Individual Rule Performance**:
   - Some individual rules exhibit high confidence and lift but have very low support. For example, **Rule 3** has a confidence of ~73.18% and a lift of ~1.4659 but only covers ~6.86% of the data.
   - **Rule 2** has zero support in the training data, rendering it ineffective despite a theoretical confidence of 50% and a lift of 1.0.

---

### **Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum**: The decrease in overall metrics suggests that the current set of rules may have reached a local minimum. The rules are highly specific, leading to higher confidence and lift in individual cases but failing to generalize across the dataset (as indicated by low support).
- **Number of Iterations**: Given that metrics are declining or plateauing, it may indicate that sufficient iterations have been performed under the current approach, and a different strategy may be necessary to improve the rules further.

---

### **Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Balance Between Support and Confidence**:
   - **Expand Rule Coverage**: Modify existing rules to be slightly less specific, increasing their support while maintaining acceptable levels of confidence and lift.
   - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge rules with overlapping conditions to create broader rules that cover more data points.

2. **Refine Rule Conditions**:
   - **Generalize Functional Groups**: Instead of specifying exact positions (e.g., "para-substituted"), consider broader categories (e.g., "electron-donating groups on aromatic rings").
   - **Include Additional Variables**: Incorporate other relevant features (e.g., solvent effects, temperature) that may influence the reaction yield.

3. **Re-evaluate Low-Support Rules**:
   - **Eliminate Ineffective Rules**: Rules with zero or negligible support (e.g., **Rule 2**) should be reconsidered or removed.
   - **Adjust Thresholds**: Review the criteria used to generate rules to ensure that they are neither too strict nor too lenient.

4. **Statistical Validation**:
   - **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the generalizability of the rules across different subsets of the data.
   - **Test on External Data**: If possible, validate the rules on an independent test set to evaluate their predictive performance.

5. **Focus on High-Leverage Rules**:
   - **Prioritize Rules with Positive Leverage**: Rules with positive leverage contribute more to the predictive power of the model. Emphasize developing rules that not only have high confidence and lift but also positive leverage values.

6. **Incorporate Domain Expertise**:
   - **Chemical Intuition**: Reassess the physico-chemical justifications for each rule to ensure they align with known chemical principles.
   - **Consult Literature**: Reference existing studies to identify known modifiers or conditions that significantly impact yield.

7. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - **Feedback Loop**: Use insights from the analysis to iteratively refine the rules, continuously monitoring the impact on metrics.
   - **Stop Criteria**: Establish clear criteria for when to stop iterating, such as when improvements in metrics become negligible.

---

### **Conclusion**

The current set of rules, while exhibiting high confidence and lift in some cases, suffer from low support and negative leverage in aggregate, indicating that they may not be capturing the underlying patterns effectively. To enhance the performance of the rules:

- Strive for a better balance between specificity and generality.
- Focus on rules that contribute positively to the predictive model.
- Leverage both statistical analysis and chemical knowledge to guide rule development.

By implementing these recommendations, it is anticipated that the rules can be improved to achieve higher confidence and lift while also increasing support, ultimately leading to a more robust and predictive model for the catalytic problem at hand.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the performance of the current rules appears to be suboptimal. The 5-fold validation accuracy has decreased to **42.86%**, which is significantly lower than previous iterations where validation accuracies ranged from **62.5% to 76%**, and test accuracies were around **62.5% to 75%**. This decline suggests that the current set of rules is not effectively capturing the underlying patterns required for accurate predictions.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

The consistently low validation accuracy across folds indicates that the model may be **underfitting** the data. This suggests that the current rules are too simplistic or insufficient to model the complexity of the relationship between molecular structures and catalyst loading. The model is not capturing essential features needed to generalize to unseen data.

Additionally, the lack of improvement over successive iterations and the relatively stagnant performance metrics imply that a local minimum may have been reached. This plateau in performance suggests that further iterations using the current approach may not yield significant improvements without substantial changes to the rules.

**Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

To identify problematic rules, we examine molecules where there is a discrepancy between predicted and experimental values, focusing on the SHAP values associated with each rule.

1. **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High)**:

   - **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**:
     - **Rules with High Negative SHAP Values**:
       - **Rule 1**: SHAP value **-0.0573**
       - **Rule 3**: SHAP value **-0.0141**
     - **Analysis**:
       - Both Rule 1 and Rule 3 are contributing negatively, leading to underestimation.
       - **Rule 1** may be too restrictive, penalizing molecules it should not.
   
   - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**:
     - **Rules with High Negative SHAP Values**:
       - **Rule 3**: SHAP value **-0.0195**
     - **Analysis**:
       - **Rule 3** is significantly contributing to the underestimation.
       - The rule may not account for certain molecular features present in this molecule.

2. **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low)**:

   - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)C(=O)O**:
     - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
       - **Rule 1**: SHAP value **0.0490**
     - **Analysis**:
       - **Rule 1** is contributing positively to the overestimation.
       - The rule may be overgeneralizing, capturing molecules it shouldn’t.

   - **CSCC[C@@H](C(=O)NCC(=O)O)N**:
     - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
       - **Rule 1**: SHAP value **0.0325**
     - **Analysis**:
       - Again, **Rule 1** is leading to overestimation.
       - Suggests the need for refinement to prevent false positives.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

The declining accuracy metrics suggest that the probability of improvement using the current rules without modification is low. The model's inability to accurately predict catalyst loading indicates that the rules do not sufficiently capture the necessary structural features or patterns. This lack of improvement over iterations implies that the current rule set may have reached its limit in effectiveness.

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis**

The SHAP analysis provides valuable insights into which rules are influencing the predictions:

- **Rule 1** is frequently associated with high positive SHAP values in overestimations and high negative SHAP values in underestimations.
- **Rule 3** similarly shows up with negative SHAP values in cases of underestimation.
  
This indicates that **Rule 1 and Rule 3** are influential but may be inaccurately applied or too broadly defined. There is an opportunity to refine these rules to improve the model's predictive accuracy.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made to improve the current rules:

1. **Refine Rule 1**:

   - **Issue**: Rule 1 is contributing to both overestimations and underestimations due to high SHAP values with incorrect predictions.
   - **Recommendation**:
     - **Review and Narrow the Scope**: Ensure that the definition of "short aliphatic chains" and "primary amino groups" is precise and does not include molecules where the rule should not apply.
     - **Incorporate Exceptions**: Identify specific structural features in the mispredicted molecules that should be exceptions to Rule 1.
     - **Adjust Thresholds**: Modify any length or functional group thresholds to better align with the experimental data.

2. **Adjust Rule 3**:

   - **Issue**: Rule 3 shows negative SHAP values in underestimations, indicating it may be penalizing molecules incorrectly.
   - **Recommendation**:
     - **Reassess Heterocyclic Definitions**: Ensure that the rule accurately identifies heterocycles with accessible nitrogen atoms and does not exclude molecules that fit this criterion but are currently misclassified.
     - **Include Additional Examples**: Update the rule to encompass a broader range of heterocyclic structures that have demonstrated high yields experimentally.

3. **Introduce Specificity in Rules**:

   - **Add Sub-Rules**: Create sub-rules within existing rules to handle exceptions or specific cases (e.g., differentiate between types of aromatic compounds in Rule 2 and Rule 3).
   - **Consider Steric and Electronic Factors**: Incorporate considerations for steric hindrance and electronic properties that may affect catalyst interaction.

4. **Address Overfitting/Underfitting**:

   - **Expand Feature Set**: Introduce new rules that capture additional molecular features not currently accounted for, such as ring strain, tautomeric forms, or specific electronic effects.
   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: For rules that may be too complex and contributing to overfitting, simplify them to focus on the most impactful features.

5. **Leverage SHAP Analysis for Rule Modification**:

   - **Identify Patterns**: Use SHAP values to identify patterns in mispredictions, guiding where rules may be misapplied.
   - **Iteratively Test Rule Changes**: Make incremental adjustments to the rules and evaluate the impact on model performance in subsequent iterations.

6. **Include Additional Training Data**:

   - **Expand Dataset**: Incorporate more experimental data to provide a richer training set, potentially improving model generalization.
   - **Balance Classes**: Ensure that the dataset has a balanced representation of high and low yield modifiers to prevent bias.

7. **Validate and Update Rules with Domain Expertise**:

   - **Consult Chemists**: Collaborate with chemists to validate the rules against chemical intuition and experimental observations.
   - **Update Physico-Chemical Rationale**: Reassess the underlying physico-chemical properties in the rules to ensure they accurately reflect the observed behaviors.

**Conclusion**

By refining **Rule 1** and **Rule 3** to be more precise and adjusting them based on the discrepancies identified through SHAP analysis, the accuracy of the model can potentially be improved. Introducing new rules or modifying existing ones to better capture the nuances in molecular structures will enhance the model's ability to generalize and reduce both overfitting and underfitting. Continuous iterations of rule refinement, guided by performance metrics and SHAP insights, will be crucial in developing a more robust predictive model.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization:**

The current set of rules aimed at predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction is underperforming. The key points from the analysis are:

1. **Declining Accuracy Metrics:**
   - The 5-fold validation accuracy has decreased to **42.86%**, significantly lower than previous iterations, where validation accuracies ranged from **62.5% to 76%**.
   - This decline suggests that the model is not effectively capturing the necessary patterns to predict the reaction yield accurately.

2. **Underfitting Indications:**
   - The consistently low validation accuracy indicates that the model may be **underfitting** the data.
   - The current rules may be too simplistic or insufficient to model the complexity of the relationship between molecular structures and reaction yield.

3. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - **Rule 1** and **Rule 3** are contributing significantly to incorrect predictions.
   - High negative SHAP values for these rules in molecules where the prediction is low but the experimental value is high suggest that these rules are penalizing certain molecules incorrectly.
   - Conversely, high positive SHAP values in overestimated predictions indicate that these rules may be overgeneralizing.

4. **Rule Metrics Evaluation:**
   - The **train support** for the current rules has decreased, implying that the rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset.
   - The **train confidence** and **lift** values have slightly decreased, indicating weaker association and predictive power.
   - Negative **leverage** values suggest that the rules' antecedent and consequent are less likely to occur together than expected by chance.

5. **Possibility of a Local Minimum:**
   - The lack of improvement and declining metrics over successive iterations suggest that the current rules may have reached a local minimum.
   - Without significant changes, further iterations using the current approach may not yield improvements.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Rule 1:**
   - **Issue:** Overestimation and underestimation in predictions due to broad application.
   - **Action:**
     - Incorporate specific chain length constraints (e.g., 2 to 5 carbons) to ensure the aliphatic chain is appropriately short.
     - Ensure that both the primary amino group and the carboxyl group are terminal and directly connected to the aliphatic chain.
     - Exclude molecules where steric hindrance or additional functional groups may interfere with coordination.

2. **Adjust Rule 3:**
   - **Issue:** Exclusion of relevant heterocyclic compounds leading to underestimation.
   - **Action:**
     - Broaden the SMARTS pattern to include a wider range of heterocyclic aromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms.
     - Ensure accessibility of the nitrogen atom for metal coordination is considered in the rule.
     - Include structures like pyrimidine, imidazole, and other relevant heterocycles.

3. **Increase Specificity and Flexibility in Rules:**
   - Introduce **sub-rules** to handle exceptions and specific cases, reducing overgeneralization.
   - Incorporate **steric and electronic factors** into the rules to account for molecules where functional groups may be present but not effectively contribute to coordination due to hindrance or electron distribution.
   - Use **logical operators and recursive SMARTS** in the pattern definitions to capture complex structural features.

4. **Leverage SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement:**
   - Use SHAP values to identify which rules most significantly impact incorrect predictions.
   - For rules with high negative or positive SHAP values contributing to errors, adjust the conditions to minimize misclassification.

5. **Review and Update All Rules:**
   - Ensure that each rule aligns closely with the underlying physico-chemical principles and the observed data.
   - Generalize overly specific patterns to increase support while maintaining confidence.
   - Eliminate or revise rules with zero or negative leverage to enhance overall predictive power.

6. **Balance Rule Complexity and Generalization:**
   - Strive for a balance between too specific and too general rules to avoid underfitting and overfitting.
   - Focus on **high-impact features** that are most predictive of the yield, even if they cover a smaller portion of the dataset.

7. **Incorporate Additional Data and Features:**
   - If possible, include more experimental data to enrich the training set and improve generalization.
   - Consider additional molecular descriptors or reaction conditions that may influence yield, such as solvent interactions or substrate-catalyst compatibility.

8. **Collaborate with Domain Experts:**
   - Consult with chemists to validate the rules against chemical intuition and empirical evidence.
   - Update the physico-chemical rationale of the rules based on expert feedback.

9. **Iterative Testing and Validation:**
   - After making adjustments, re-evaluate the rules using cross-validation to assess improvements.
   - Continuously monitor the impact of changes on the accuracy, confidence, lift, and leverage metrics.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

Based on the analysis, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Underfitting Indication:** The low accuracy suggests that the model is underfitting, and there is room to capture more complexity.
- **Rule Refinement Potential:** By adjusting the rules' specificity and incorporating additional relevant features, the model can better capture the patterns in the data.
- **Avoiding Overfitting:** By focusing on improving rules that have a solid physico-chemical basis and ensuring they generalize well across the dataset, overfitting can be minimized.

**Conclusion:**

Given the above considerations, further optimization of the current rules is warranted and has the potential to significantly improve the model's performance.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have multiple hydroxyl (**–OH**) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group, forming polyol structures either in aliphatic chains or cyclic forms.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal centers, enhancing binding affinity and stability of the catalyst complex. They also increase solubility in polar solvents, improving interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers Containing Sulfhydryl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that possess a sulfhydryl group (**–SH**) on a short aliphatic chain in addition to a carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal coordination due to the lone pair on sulfur. Short chains allow for effective interaction without significant steric hindrance.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield; the aromatic ring may limit sulfur accessibility or affect electronic properties unfavorably)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have aldehyde groups (**–CHO**) directly attached to the aromatic ring or adjacent to the carboxylic acid group.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are highly reactive and can form undesired side reactions or irreversibly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst and reducing yield.

  - **Description**: Modifiers that contain internal ether linkages (**–O–**) within their aliphatic chains, particularly polyether structures.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms are less available for coordination due to their positioning within flexible chains. This flexibility can decrease binding affinity to metal centers due to entropic penalties.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Compound **32**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Amide Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Lead to Low Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing amide bonds (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group or within the main chain.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups can engage in resonance, reducing the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for metal coordination. This can decrease the interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Compound **23**)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Long Aliphatic Chains Without Additional Functional Groups Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of six or more carbons and no additional functional groups like amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate. The terminal carboxyl group remains available for metal coordination without interference from other groups.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield; hydroxyl group may lead to unwanted side interactions)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield; amino group may interfere with proper coordination)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Donor Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

  - **Description**: Amino acid modifiers with aromatic side chains that include heteroatoms capable of coordinating with metal centers, such as the indole nitrogen in tryptophan.

  - **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Donor heteroatoms in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and potentially stabilizing reactive intermediates.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield; lacks a coordinating heteroatom in the side chain)

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed to illustrate the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their effects on the reaction yield. They combine multiple substructures and functional groups to provide comprehensive guidelines:

- **Coverage**: The rules encompass a wide range of structural features present in the dataset, including various functional groups, ring systems, and chain lengths.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Each rule is grounded in chemical principles, such as coordination chemistry, electronic effects, steric factors, and solubility, explaining why certain features lead to high or low yields.

- **Balance**: The set includes both broad rules with wide applicability and more specific rules that address particular structural features, striking a balance between simplicity and complexity.

By applying these rules, predictions can be made regarding the effectiveness of potential modifiers based on their molecular structures. This can guide the selection and design of modifiers to optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 1 to Include Specific Chain Length Constraints and Structural Requirements**

  - **Action**:
    - Modify Rule 1 to specify that the aliphatic chain length should be between **2 to 5 carbons**.
    - Ensure that both the **primary amino group (-NH₂)** and the **carboxyl group (-COOH)** are **terminal** and directly connected to the aliphatic chain without any intervening atoms or functional groups.
    - Exclude modifiers with additional functional groups or branching that may introduce **steric hindrance** or interfere with metal coordination.
    - **Update the SMARTS pattern** to reflect these constraints. For example, the SMARTS pattern could be adjusted to:
      ```
      [NX3H2][CH2][CH2][C](=O)O
      ```
      This pattern represents a primary amino group connected to a short aliphatic chain ending with a carboxylic acid group.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust Rule 3 to Broaden the Scope of Heterocyclic Aromatic Carboxylic Acids and Ensure Nitrogen Accessibility**

  - **Action**:
    - Expand Rule 3 to include a wider variety of **heterocyclic aromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms**, such as **pyrimidine**, **imidazole**, **triazole**, and others that are known to coordinate with metal centers.
    - Ensure that the **nitrogen atom is not sterically hindered** and is accessible for coordination by excluding structures with substitutions adjacent to the nitrogen.
    - **Modify the SMARTS pattern** to include these heterocycles while accounting for substitution patterns. An example SMARTS pattern could be:
      ```
      [nH]1cccc1C(=O)O
      ```
      This pattern represents a heteroaromatic ring with at least one nitrogen atom and a carboxylic acid group directly attached to the ring.

- **Advice 3**: **Increase Specificity and Flexibility by Introducing Sub-Rules and Logical Operators**

  - **Action**:
    - **Create sub-rules** within existing rules to handle exceptions and specific cases, reducing overgeneralization.
    - Incorporate **logical operators** (AND, OR, NOT) in the SMARTS patterns to combine multiple conditions.
    - Use **recursive SMARTS** to capture complex structural features and ensure that only relevant modifiers are included.
    - For example, within Rule 1, a sub-rule could exclude modifiers with branching or bulky substituents:
      ```
      [NX3H2][CH2][CH2][CH2][C](=O)O; !$(C(-*)-*[*])
      ```
      This pattern includes a 3-carbon chain without additional substituents.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Steric and Electronic Factors into Rules**

  - **Action**:
    - **Assess steric hindrance** by identifying bulky groups near coordination sites using SMARTS patterns that detect large substituents (e.g., tert-butyl, phenyl groups).
    - Include **electronic effects** by considering electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups adjacent to functional groups involved in coordination.
    - Update rules to exclude modifiers where these factors negatively impact metal coordination.
    - For example, exclude modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to coordinating atoms:
      ```
      [C](=[O])[C]=[O]
      ```
      This pattern matches carboxylic acids adjacent to carbonyl groups, which may reduce coordination ability.

- **Advice 5**: **Leverage SHAP Analysis to Refine Rules Contributing to Incorrect Predictions**

  - **Action**:
    - Identify rules with **high negative or positive SHAP values** associated with incorrect predictions.
    - Analyze the molecules affected and determine why the rule misclassifies them.
    - Adjust the rule's conditions to minimize misclassification, such as adding or modifying constraints.
    - For instance, if Rule 1 incorrectly predicts low yield for certain modifiers, revise the rule to include those cases.

- **Advice 6**: **Review and Update All Rules for Alignment with Physico-Chemical Principles**

  - **Action**:
    - **Re-express rules with zero or negative leverage**, ensuring they accurately reflect chemical behavior.
    - Adjust rules with **low confidence or lift values** to improve their predictive power.
    - Validate that each rule's **physico-chemical rationale** is sound and matches experimental observations.
    - Remove or revise rules that do not contribute positively to the model's performance.

- **Advice 7**: **Refine Rule 10 Regarding Long Aliphatic Chains Without Additional Functional Groups**

  - **Action**:
    - Re-evaluate Rule 10 to consider the impact of chain length and the absence of functional groups.
    - Introduce a chain length limit (e.g., 6 to 8 carbons) where longer chains may lead to decreased solubility or steric hindrance.
    - Exclude modifiers with hidden polar groups or branching that may affect the yield negatively.
    - Update the SMARTS pattern to specify linear aliphatic chains:
      ```
      [CH3][CH2]{4,6}[C](=O)O
      ```
      This pattern represents an unbranched aliphatic chain of 5 to 7 carbons ending with a carboxylic acid.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors Influencing Yield**

  - **Action**:
    - Consider including **hydrogen-bonding capacity**, **pKa values**, or **logP** (octanol-water partition coefficient) as features in the rules.
    - Use SMARTS patterns to identify functional groups involved in hydrogen bonding (e.g., hydroxyl, amino groups).
    - Adjust rules to account for modifiers that may affect **solubility** or **metal-binding affinity** due to these properties.
    - For example, exclude modifiers with very high or low pKa values that may not be deprotonated under reaction conditions.

- **Advice 9**: **Collaborate with Domain Experts to Validate and Refine Rules**

  - **Action**:
    - Present the updated rules to chemists or domain experts for feedback.
    - **Discuss the physico-chemical rationale** behind each rule and receive input on potential oversights.
    - Use expert insights to fine-tune SMARTS patterns and the conditions within the rules.
    - Ensure that the rules are both **chemically sound** and **aligned with experimental evidence**.

- **Advice 10**: **Iteratively Test and Validate the Updated Rules**

  - **Action**:
    - After implementing the changes, perform **cross-validation** to evaluate the improvements in accuracy, confidence, lift, and leverage.
    - **Monitor metrics** to ensure that adjustments lead to better predictions without introducing overfitting.
    - **Iterate** the process by refining rules based on validation results until optimal performance is achieved.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Consolidate Rules with Similar Functional Groups and Physico-Chemical Insights to Improve Coverage**

  Several rules currently have limited coverage due to being supported by only one or two examples. To enhance robustness and general applicability, consider merging rules that share similar functional groups or underlying physico-chemical properties. For instance:

  - **Combine Rule 2 and Rule 14**: Both rules focus on aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-donating groups (amino or methoxy) at positions that enhance electron density. By generalizing the rule to include all strong electron-donating groups (e.g., **–NH₂**, **–OCH₃**) in activating positions on the aromatic ring, you can increase coverage and strengthen the rule. Include additional compounds such as **Compound 25** (supports methoxy substitution) to bolster the rule's applicability.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rules with Inconsistent Examples to Improve Clarity and Reliability**

  Rules that contain contradictions or include exceptions without clear justification need refinement. Specifically:

  - **Revise Rule 2**: Remove **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**) from examples predicting high yield, as nitro groups are electron-withdrawing and contradict the rule's premise. Alternatively, create a separate rule addressing exceptions where electron-withdrawing groups unexpectedly lead to high yield, providing a detailed physico-chemical explanation.

- **Advice 3**: **Expand Data Support for Rules with Limited Examples**

  To enhance the credibility of rules with minimal examples, seek additional data points or literature examples that fit the rule criteria. For instance:

  - **Strengthen Rule 5**: Identify and include more modifiers containing sulfhydryl groups on short aliphatic chains that lead to high yield. Additional examples will improve coverage and confirm the rule's validity.

  - **Augment Rule 10**: Search for other amino acids or compounds with aromatic side chains containing donor heteroatoms (e.g., histidine with an imidazole ring) that result in high yield. This will support the rule with more data points.

- **Advice 4**: **Eliminate or Reconsider Rules with Insufficient Data and Minimal Impact**

  Rules supported by a single example and lacking significant physico-chemical justification may not be robust enough for inclusion. Consider removing them or merging them with other rules:

  - **Reassess Rule 7**: Given that it is only supported by **Compound 14**, and perfluorinated compounds are uncommon modifiers, it may be practical to omit this rule or incorporate its insights into a broader rule about electron-withdrawing groups.

  - **Reevaluate Rule 12 and Rule 13**: With only one supporting example each, these rules may not provide substantial predictive value. Merge their key insights into existing rules where appropriate or collect more data to justify their inclusion.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance Physico-Chemical Explanations for Rules with Limited Insight**

  For rules where the physico-chemical rationale is minimal or oversimplified, provide more detailed explanations to justify the predictions. For example:

  - **Improve Rule 11**: Elaborate on why long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups lead to high yield. Discuss how hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst framework or solvent effects may play a role, and consider any exceptions.

- **Advice 6**: **Include Steric and Electronic Factors in Rule Development**

  Incorporate considerations of steric hindrance and electronic effects more explicitly in the rules, as they are critical in coordination chemistry:

  - **Enhance Rule 15**: While the rule mentions steric hindrance due to long aliphatic chains with amino groups, providing quantitative limits (e.g., chain length thresholds) and discussing the impact on coordination geometries can improve clarity.

- **Advice 7**: **Develop General Rules for Electron-Withdrawing and Electron-Donating Substituents**

  Create broader rules that categorize modifiers based on the nature and position of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents, rather than focusing on specific functional groups:

  - **Formulate a Rule on Electron-Withdrawing Groups Leading to Low Yield**: Combine insights from existing rules (e.g., Rules 6, 7, 12, and 13) to establish a general rule that modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to coordination sites reduce yield due to decreased electron density available for metal coordination.

  - **Establish a Rule on Electron-Donating Groups Enhancing Yield**: Integrate findings from Rules 2, 4, and 14 into a unified rule that emphasizes the positive effect of electron-donating groups in specific positions enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

- **Advice 8**: **Introduce Structural Flexibility Considerations into the Rules**

  Address the impact of molecular flexibility on metal coordination and catalyst interaction:

  - **Amend Rules Involving Chain Lengths**: Specify optimal chain lengths that balance flexibility and steric hindrance. Discuss how too much flexibility (from long chains) or rigidity (from bulky groups) can negatively affect yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Solubility and Solvent Interaction Factors**

  Acknowledge how the solubility of modifiers in the reaction solvent influences yield:

  - **Integrate Solubility into Existing Rules**: For modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (Rule 4) or long hydrophobic chains (Rule 11), explain how solubility in acetonitrile affects their availability to interact with the catalyst and participate in the reaction.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Update Rules Using Computational Modeling or Additional Experiments**

  Use computational chemistry tools or design targeted experiments to test and refine the rules:

  - **Perform Molecular Docking Studies**: Evaluate how different modifiers interact with the catalyst at the molecular level to support or refute existing rules.

  - **Conduct Additional Reactions**: Synthesize and test modifiers that fit ambiguous or underrepresented categories to gather more data and improve rule accuracy.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Structural Features for Numerical Encoding**

  Reframe the current rules to focus on quantifiable structural features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. This will facilitate the creation of a numeric feature matrix. For example:

  - **Functional Group Counts**: Count the number of specific functional groups present in each modifier, such as amino groups, carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups, sulfhydryl groups, and methoxy groups.
  - **Aliphatic Chain Lengths**: Quantify the lengths of aliphatic chains (e.g., number of carbon atoms in the longest continuous chain).
  - **Aromatic Ring Substitutions**: Numerically encode the position (ortho, meta, para) and type of substituents on aromatic rings.
  - **Heteroatom Presence**: Count the number of heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) in heterocycles and their positioning relative to other functional groups.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate and Simplify Overlapping Rules**

  Review and merge overlapping or similar rules to reduce complexity and redundancy. For instance:

  - Combine rules related to electron-donating groups on aromatic rings (Rules 2 and 13) into a single, more general rule that accounts for various electron-donating substituents.
  - Integrate rules concerning chain length and functional group positioning (Rules 1, 9, and 14) to create a unified rule about the effects of chain length and substituents on yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Introduce Computable Molecular Descriptors**

  Utilize molecular descriptors that can be calculated from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools. Examples include:

  - **Electrotopological State Indices**: Quantify electron density and steric effects.
  - **Log P Values**: Assess hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of modifiers.
  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**: Estimate the compound's ability to interact with the catalytic system.
  - **Molecular Weight and Complexity**: Include as variables that may correlate with yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Utilize Cheminformatics Software for Feature Extraction**

  Employ tools like RDKit or Open Babel to automatically extract features from SMILES strings. This ensures consistency and scalability in feature generation. These tools can compute:

  - Functional group counts
  - Ring counts and types (aromatic, aliphatic)
  - Presence of specific substructures or motifs
  - Molecular fingerprints for similarity analysis

- **Advice 5**: **Apply Machine Learning for Data-Driven Rule Refinement**

  Implement supervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to analyze the dataset and identify features most strongly associated with high or low yields. This approach can:

  - Reveal new patterns not captured by existing rules.
  - Quantify the importance of different features.
  - Suggest thresholds or cut-off values for numerical descriptors.

- **Advice 6**: **Reevaluate and Adjust Existing Rules Based on Data Analysis**

  Perform a thorough analysis of the dataset to identify any discrepancies between the rules' predictions and actual outcomes. For example:

  - Check for modifiers that are exceptions to the rules and investigate why they do not fit the pattern.
  - Update rules to account for these exceptions or clarify conditions under which the rules apply.

- **Advice 7**: **Enhance Specificity with Numerical Thresholds**

  Where possible, define explicit numerical thresholds within the rules. For example:

  - Specify exact chain length ranges (e.g., "Aliphatic chains with 3 to 6 carbons").
  - Quantify what constitutes a "high" or "low" number of electron-donating groups.
  - Use partial charges or electronegativity values to define electron-donating or electron-withdrawing effects more precisely.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Negative Features Explicitly**

  Identify and encode features that negatively impact yield. This includes:

  - Counting electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl groups) and specifying their effects.
  - Including steric hindrance factors by assessing bulkiness around coordination sites.
  - Noting the presence of functional groups that may interfere with the catalyst (e.g., amide bonds, extensive fluorination).

- **Advice 9**: **Develop Hierarchical Decision Rules**

  Organize the rules into a decision tree format, prioritizing features based on their impact on yield. This hierarchical approach simplifies predictions and can be translated into numerical decision paths that aid in feature matrix construction.

- **Advice 10**: **Standardize Terminology and Criteria**

  Ensure all terms and criteria used in the rules are clearly defined and standardized for consistency. For example:

  - Define what is considered a "short" vs. "long" aliphatic chain numerically.
  - Specify positions on aromatic rings numerically (e.g., position 1, 2, 3).
  - Use consistent naming conventions for functional groups and structural motifs.

- **Advice 11**: **Expand the Dataset for Better Rule Validation**

  To improve the robustness of the rules, consider expanding the dataset to include more modifiers with diverse structures. A larger dataset will provide:

  - More statistical power to detect significant patterns.
  - Better validation of the rules through cross-validation techniques.
  - Increased likelihood of capturing rare but important structural features.

- **Advice 12**: **Engage in Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction**

  Apply techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to:

  - Reduce the dimensionality of the feature set.
  - Identify the most informative features.
  - Simplify the model without significant loss of predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 13**: **Implement Cross-Validation for Model Reliability**

  Use cross-validation methods to test the predictive power of the refined rules and numeric feature matrix. This will:

  - Ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
  - Prevent overfitting to the current dataset.
  - Provide confidence in the applicability of the rules.

- **Advice 14**: **Iteratively Refine Rules Based on Model Performance**

  Continuously update and improve the rules by:

  - Comparing predicted yields with actual yields.
  - Adjusting rules and thresholds based on discrepancies.
  - Incorporating new insights from ongoing experimental results.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Express Rules Using Quantifiable Molecular Descriptors**

  - **Explanation**: Redefine the rules using molecular descriptors that can be numerically quantified from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "short aliphatic chains (≤6 carbons)", specify "aliphatic chains with a carbon count ≤6". Use descriptors such as:

    - **Atom Counts**: Number of specific atoms (C, H, N, O, S, F, etc.)
    - **Functional Group Counts**: Number of functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl)
    - **Ring Counts**: Number of aromatic or aliphatic rings
    - **Chain Lengths**: Lengths of aliphatic chains
    - **Molecular Weight**: Exact or ranges
    - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**
    - **LogP (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient)**

  This will facilitate the generation of a numerical feature matrix suitable for statistical analysis or machine learning models.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize SMARTS Patterns for Functional Group Identification**

    - **Carboxylic Acid Group**: `[CX3](=O)[OX1H]`
    - **Sulfhydryl Group**: `[SX2H]`
    - **Aromatic Ring with Para Substitution**: `c1cc([R])ccc1[R]`

  By using SMARTS patterns, features can be systematically extracted and converted into numerical variables.

- **Advice 3**: **Include Numerical Thresholds and Ranges**

  - **Explanation**: Where applicable, specify numerical thresholds or ranges for properties that influence yield. For instance:

    - **Descriptor**: "Modifiers with a LogP between X and Y"
    - **Chain Length**: "Aliphatic chains with 3 to 6 carbon atoms"
    - **pKa Values**: "Modifiers with carboxylic acid pKa between A and B"

  This precision allows for clear criteria when generating numeric features and improves reproducibility.

- **Advice 4**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules and Eliminate Redundancies**

  - **Explanation**: Review the current rules for overlaps and redundancies. Consolidate similar rules to simplify the rule set. For example, combine rules that deal with electron-donating groups on aromatic rings. A unified rule may state:

    - **Combined Rule**: "Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, methoxy) at the para position on aromatic carboxylic acids lead to high yield"

  This simplification reduces complexity and aids in feature extraction.

- **Advice 5**: **Define Negative Rules Using Absence or Count of Features**

  - **Explanation**: When certain features lead to low yield, define them in terms of absence or counts. For example:

    - "Modifiers **without** nitrogen heterocycles coordinating with metals result in low yield"
    - "Modifiers with **more than** three fluorine atoms lead to low yield"

  This approach helps in creating binary or count-based features for the numeric matrix.

- **Advice 6**: **Assign Numerical Values to Steric and Electronic Effects**

  - **Explanation**: Quantify steric hindrance and electronic effects using descriptors like:

    - **Sterimol Parameters**: For steric bulk
    - **Hammett Sigma Values**: For electronic substituent effects
    - **Molar Refractivity**: For steric and electronic properties

  Including these values in the feature matrix allows for a quantitative assessment of their impact on yield.

  - **Explanation**: Develop numerical descriptors that estimate a modifier's ability to coordinate with metal ions, such as:

    - **Donor Atom Count**: Number of atoms capable of donating electron pairs (N, O, S)
    - **Chelation Potential**: Indicators of multidentate ligand capacity
    - **Ligand Field Parameters**

  These descriptors can help predict the effectiveness of modifiers in stabilizing metal centers.

- **Advice 8**: **Standardize Modifier Structures for Comparison**

  - **Explanation**: Normalize the structures of modifiers to a common framework to allow direct comparison. For example:

    - **Backbone Structure**: Represent aliphatic chain length as a variable
    - **Substituent Positions**: Numbering system for positions on aromatic rings

  Standardization ensures consistency when extracting features and reduces errors in data processing.

- **Advice 9**: **Include Solubility and Lipophilicity Descriptors**

  - **Explanation**: As solubility can influence reaction kinetics and yield, include descriptors like:

    - **Calculated Water Solubility (LogS)**
    - **Lipophilicity (LogP)**
    - **Hydrogen Bond Donor/Acceptor Counts**

  These properties can be computed from SMILES and included in the numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 10**: **Use Machine Learning to Derive New Rules**

  - **Explanation**: Apply machine learning algorithms to the existing dataset to identify patterns and relationships that may not be immediately apparent. Techniques include:

    - **Feature Importance Analysis**: Determine which descriptors most significantly affect yield
    - **Decision Trees or Random Forests**: Generate rules based on the most predictive features
    - **Clustering Analysis**: Group modifiers with similar properties and yields

  The insights gained can inform the creation of more effective and data-driven rules.

- **Advice 11**: **Create a Binary Feature Matrix for High and Low Yield Classification**

  - **Explanation**: Convert qualitative rules into binary features (0 or 1) indicating the presence or absence of specific structural characteristics. This allows for the use of classification algorithms to predict high or low yield based on feature combinations.

- **Advice 12**: **Document Exceptions Clearly and Investigate Their Causes**

  - **Explanation**: For cases where modifiers do not follow the general rules (e.g., exceptions in Rule 9), document them explicitly and analyze their molecular descriptors to identify factors contributing to the deviation. This may lead to refinement of the rules or identification of additional descriptors to include.

- **Advice 13**: **Integrate Quantum Chemical Calculations for Electronic Properties**

  - **Explanation**: For a more detailed understanding of electronic effects, perform quantum chemical calculations to obtain descriptors like:

    - **Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) Energy**
    - **Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) Energy**
    - **Electron Density Distribution**

  Although computationally intensive, these descriptors can provide insights into reactivity and coordination ability.

- **Advice 14**: **Develop a Workflow for Automated Feature Extraction**

  - **Explanation**: Establish a computational workflow using cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit, Open Babel) to automate the extraction of the defined descriptors from SMILES strings. This ensures scalability and efficiency in processing larger datasets.

- **Advice 15**: **Validate and Update Rules Based on Additional Data**

  - **Explanation**: Continuously validate the rules against new experimental data to assess their predictive power. Update the rules as necessary to improve accuracy, ensuring they remain relevant and effective in guiding modifier selection.

The physico-chemical insights are satisfactory, discussing electron-withdrawing interference. Complexity is suitable, and coverage is good with multiple examples (Compounds 19, 20, 27) and a counterexample (Compound 25).
- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, stating that modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to carboxylic acid groups lead to low yield. Physico-chemical insights are adequate, explaining resonance effects. Complexity is appropriate, but coverage is limited to two examples (Compounds 23, 33), which is acceptable but could be stronger.
- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in describing that modifiers with flexible ether chains lead to low yield. The physico-chemical insights are reasonable, but coverage is inadequate with only one supporting example (Compound 11), which undermines the rule's strength according to the criteria.
- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, indicating that modifiers with sulfhydryl groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield. The physico-chemical insights are acceptable. However, coverage is insufficient with only one supporting example (Compound 18) and a counterexample (Compound 10), making the rule weak per the criteria.
- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly states that amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms lead to high yield. The physico-chemical insights are adequate. Coverage is limited to one supporting example (Compound 15) and a counterexample (Compound 13), reducing the rule's reliability.
- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 lacks clarity due to its broad description of "unique aromatic systems capable of chelation," making it difficult to apply. Physico-chemical insights are present but vague. Coverage is inadequate with only one example (Compound 17), which does not meet the criteria for sufficient support.
- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear, stating that modifiers with halomethyl groups on aromatic rings lead to high yield. Physico-chemical insights are provided. However, coverage is insufficient with only one supporting example (Compound 1), which does not satisfy the coverage criteria.
- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is somewhat complex due to the exception for nitro groups. The physico-chemical insights are adequate, but the exception reduces clarity. Coverage includes examples supporting both high yield (Compound 21) and low yield (Compounds 19, 20), but the rule's complexity and exception may hinder practical application.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Strengthen Rules with Limited Coverage by Adding More Examples**

  Some rules, such as Rule 5 (Modifiers with Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids of Medium Chain Lengths) and Rule 11 (Modifiers That Are Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield), have limited supporting examples. To enhance their validity:

  - **Action**: Include additional modifiers from the dataset or relevant literature that fit these descriptions. For Rule 5, search for more medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar groups that result in high yield. For Rule 11, identify other amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms that have been tested and shown to produce high yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Similar Rules to Improve Coverage and Clarity**

  Several rules share overlapping concepts or underlying physico-chemical properties. Merging these can simplify the rule set and provide stronger coverage. For example:

  - **Action**: Merge Rule 5 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Medium Chain Lengths Lead to High Yield) and Rule 15 (Modifiers with Long Aliphatic Chains Containing Additional Polar Functional Groups Lead to Low Yield) into a single rule that highlights the impact of chain length and the presence of polar groups on yield. This consolidated rule can emphasize that medium-chain aliphatic acids without additional polar groups tend to result in high yield, whereas longer chains with polar substituents lead to low yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Revise or Remove Rules with Insufficient Support**

  Rules with minimal examples may not provide reliable guidance. Rules such as Rule 9 (Modifiers with Flexible Ether Chains Lead to Low Yield), Rule 10 (Modifiers with Sulfhydryl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield), and Rule 13 (Modifiers with Halomethyl Groups on Aromatic Rings Lead to High Yield) have limited data support.

  - **Action**: Unless additional data can be provided, consider removing these rules to focus on more robustly supported guidelines. Alternatively, adjust the rules to broaden their scope or combine them with other rules to enhance their applicability.

- **Advice 4**: **Simplify Complex Rules for Better Applicability**

  Some rules are complex or include exceptions that can hinder their practical use, such as Rule 14 (Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups on Aromatic Rings Lead to Low Yield, Except for Nitro Groups at the Para Position).

  - **Action**: Split Rule 14 into two separate rules for clarity:
    - One rule stating that modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings generally lead to low yield.
    - Another rule highlighting that para-nitrobenzoic acid is an exception due to specific resonance effects, leading to high yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance Physico-Chemical Explanations for Better Understanding**

  Strengthening the physico-chemical rationale behind each rule aids comprehension and application. Some rules could benefit from more detailed explanations.

  - **Action**: For rules like Rule 12 (Modifiers with Unique Aromatic Systems Capable of Chelation Lead to High Yield), provide a clearer description of the structural features responsible for chelation. Explain how these features interact with the metal center to enhance catalytic activity.

- **Advice 6**: **Ensure Consistent Rule Numbering and Formatting**

  Inconsistencies in rule numbering and formatting can cause confusion.

  - **Action**: Review and revise the rule set to maintain consistent numbering and formatting throughout the document. This will improve readability and ease of reference.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Additional Counterexamples Where Appropriate**

  Including counterexamples strengthens the validity of rules by illustrating their boundaries.

  - **Action**: For rules that currently lack counterexamples, such as Rule 4 (Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to High Yield), search for and include modifiers that fit the description but result in low yield, if any exist. This helps to delineate the rule's applicability.

- **Advice 8**: **Reassess and Refine Rules with Limited Practical Impact**

  Evaluate whether certain rules offer significant guidance or if they overlap with broader principles.

  - **Action**: Reassess rules like Rule 12 (Modifiers with Unique Aromatic Systems Capable of Chelation Lead to High Yield) to determine if they provide unique value. If the rule applies to a very narrow set of compounds, consider integrating its insights into other, more general rules about chelation and metal coordination.

- **Advice 9**: **Expand the Dataset to Support Underrepresented Rules**

  A limited dataset can constrain the development of comprehensive rules.

  - **Action**: If possible, conduct additional experiments or include data from the literature to expand the dataset. This can provide more support for existing rules or reveal new patterns that inform the creation of more robust rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Emphasize Practical Application in Rule Descriptions**

  Ensure that each rule provides clear guidance that can be directly applied in practice.

  - **Action**: Reword rule descriptions where necessary to focus on actionable criteria. For example, specify exact functional groups and positions that can be readily identified when selecting or designing modifiers.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers with Both Amino and Carboxylic Acid Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains (2 to 6 Carbons) Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that contain both an amino group (**–NH₂**) and at least one carboxyl group (**–COOH**) on a straight aliphatic chain of 2 to 6 carbons.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The presence of amino and carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions. Short aliphatic chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating effective interaction with metal centers in the catalyst and enhancing binding affinity.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

- **Counterexamples**:
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield; chain length exceeds six carbons, increasing flexibility and reducing effective coordination)
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**, Low Yield; longer chain introduces steric and entropic challenges)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids Para-Substituted with Functional Groups Capable of Metal Coordination Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with para-substituents that can act as Lewis bases or coordinate with metal centers, such as amino (**–NH₂**), hydroxy (**–OH**), methoxy (**–OCH₃**), or pyridyl groups.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: These functional groups enhance electron density and provide additional coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal ions in the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Compound **24**)
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**, Low Yield; the aldehyde group is electron-withdrawing and less effective for coordination)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 3**: **Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Heterocycles Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) where the nitrogen atom is available for metal coordination.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles provide additional coordination sites due to their lone pair electrons, enhancing binding with metal ions in the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**, Low Yield; steric hindrance or ineffective positioning may reduce coordination efficiency)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers possessing several hydroxyl groups (**–OH**) near the carboxyl group, forming polyol structures in aliphatic chains or cyclic forms.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal centers, enhancing binding affinity and stabilizing the catalyst complex. They also improve solubility in polar solvents, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 5**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Medium Chain Lengths (6 to 8 Carbons) Without Additional Polar Functional Groups Result in High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups beyond the terminal carboxyl group.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Such acids have suitable hydrophobicity to interact with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate. The terminal carboxyl group remains available for metal coordination without interference from other polar groups.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

- **Counterexamples**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**, Low Yield; additional hydroxyl group may introduce steric hindrance and alter coordination dynamics)
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**, Low Yield; the amino group adds polarity and potential coordination competition)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Extensive Fluorination Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers in which multiple hydrogen atoms on an alkyl chain are replaced with fluorine atoms, leading to heavily fluorinated chains.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density, reducing the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with metal ions. Fluorinated chains are also hydrophobic, which can diminish solubility and interaction with the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)
  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Compound **28**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Ketone Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid or on Aromatic Rings Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that have carbonyl-containing groups (aldehyde **–CHO** or ketone **–C=O**) directly attached to the aromatic ring or adjacent to the carboxylic acid group.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde and ketone groups are electron-withdrawing and can interfere with metal coordination, deactivating the catalyst and reducing yield.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Compound **27**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**, High Yield; methoxy groups may offset electron withdrawal, and the ketone is positioned away from coordination sites)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing amide groups (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group or within the main chain of the molecule.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide bonds can delocalize lone pair electrons through resonance, reducing the availability of nitrogen and oxygen atoms for metal coordination. This weakens interactions with the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Compound **23**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Flexible Ether Chains Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that contain internal ether linkages (**–O–**) within flexible aliphatic chains, such as polyethers.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms are less effective for coordination due to their position within flexible chains. Increased molecular flexibility can reduce effective binding to metal centers because of entropic penalties.

- **Example**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Sulfhydryl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that contain a sulfhydryl group (**–SH**) on a short aliphatic chain, along with a carboxyl group.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal coordination due to the polarizability of sulfur's lone pair electrons. Short chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing effective interaction with metal centers.

- **Example**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield; the aromatic ring may delocalize sulfur's lone pair electrons, reducing coordination ability)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers That Are Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Amino acids with aromatic side chains that include heteroatoms capable of coordinating with metal centers, such as the indole nitrogen in tryptophan.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Donor heteroatoms in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and stabilizing reactive intermediates.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**, Low Yield; lacks coordinating heteroatoms in the side chain)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Unique Aromatic Systems Capable of Chelation Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing aromatic systems with adjacent carbonyl groups capable of chelating metal centers, such as benzofuran-1,3-dione derivatives.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can act as bidentate ligands, enhancing coordination with metal centers and stabilizing the catalyst complex.

- **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Halomethyl Groups on Aromatic Rings Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with a halomethyl group (**–CH₂X**, where **X** is a halogen like bromine) at the para position.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The halomethyl group may affect electron distribution in a way that facilitates metal coordination or participate in secondary interactions, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Example**:
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Compound **1**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups on Aromatic Rings Lead to Low Yield, Except for Nitro Groups at the Para Position**

- **Description**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., aldehyde, formyl, fluorine) on aromatic rings generally reduce yield. However, modifiers with nitro groups (**–NO₂**) at the para position can result in high yield due to specific electronic effects.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, hindering metal coordination. The nitro group's resonance structures may enhance specific interactions with metal centers despite its electron-withdrawing nature.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)
  - **High Yield**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups generally result in **low yield**, but para-nitrobenzoic acid is an exception and results in **high yield**.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules provide a comprehensive framework to predict whether a molecular modifier will lead to a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By analyzing combinations of functional groups and structural features, the rules consider underlying physico-chemical properties such as:

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups like amino, hydroxy, and heterocyclic nitrogen enhance metal coordination.
- **Steric Factors**: Short aliphatic chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating effective interaction with the catalyst.
- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density, while electron-withdrawing groups decrease it, affecting metal coordination.
- **Chelation**: Multiple binding sites (e.g., adjacent hydroxyl or carbonyl groups) can chelate metal ions, stabilizing the catalyst complex.
- **Hydrophobicity and Solubility**: Chain length and polar groups influence solubility and interaction with the catalyst.

**Coverage and Balance**:

- **Broad Coverage**: The rules encompass a wide range of functional groups and structural motifs present in the dataset, including amino acids, aromatic compounds, aliphatic acids, heterocycles, and various substituents.
- **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**: The set includes simple rules with high coverage (e.g., modifiers with amino and carboxylic groups on short chains) and more complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., modifiers with unique aromatic systems capable of chelation).
- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule provides clear criteria for predicting high or low yield, aiding in the selection and design of effective modifiers.

By applying these rules, chemists can make informed decisions in selecting molecular modifiers to optimize the yield of the target reaction, advancing the goals of the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: The code currently only implements Rules 1 to 10 and does not cover Rules 11 to 14. To ensure the transformation is comprehensive and effective, please implement all 14 rules as described in the natural language section. This will provide full coverage of the features intended to be captured.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: In the code for **Rule 2**, there is an issue with identifying the para-substituted position on the aromatic ring. The current implementation assumes a fixed atom index (ring_atoms[3]) for the para position, which may not be accurate due to variable atom indexing in RDKit. It's recommended to modify the code to:

  - Identify the position of the carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring.
  - Determine the atom directly opposite (para position) relative to the carboxylic acid.
  - Check for substituents capable of metal coordination at this para position.

  You can use the `Chem.GetDistanceMatrix()` function to find the para carbon atom by selecting the ring atom that is the farthest from the carboxylic acid carbon within the ring.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 3**, the SMARTS pattern '`[n][c,C]*[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`' may not accurately capture heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen heterocycles. To improve this:

  - Modify the SMARTS pattern to specifically match carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heterocycles. For example: '`[nX2][c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1C(=O)O`' for pyridine derivatives.
  - Ensure that the pattern accounts for different types of nitrogen heterocycles by including options for pyrazole, pyrimidine, etc.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: In **Rule 4**, the code checks for multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent only to the carboxylic acid carbon. However, the rule specifies that the hydroxyl groups should be near the carboxylic acid, forming polyol structures in aliphatic chains or cyclic forms. To address this:

  - Expand the search to include hydroxyl groups within a certain bond distance (e.g., 1 or 2 bonds) from the aliphatic chain or ring containing the carboxylic acid.
  - Use a recursive SMARTS pattern or graph traversal methods to identify multiple hydroxyl groups connected to adjacent carbons in the molecule.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For **Rule 5**, the code should ensure that the aliphatic chain length is correctly calculated and that no additional polar functional groups are present. Consider:

  - Using RDKit's `Chem.FindAllPathsOfLengthN()` or similar functions to find chains of specific lengths.
  - Explicitly checking for the absence of other polar functional groups by searching for `[!#6;!H0]` (non-carbon, non-hydrogen atoms) excluding the terminal carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Review and refine the SMARTS patterns used in Rules 6 to 10 to ensure they precisely match the structural descriptions in the natural language rules. For instance:

  - In **Rule 6**, ensure that "extensive fluorination" is defined (e.g., molecules with a high ratio of fluorine atoms to total atoms or multiple CF₃ groups).
  - In **Rule 9**, adjust the pattern to accurately capture flexible ether chains, possibly by identifying repeating ether linkages (e.g., polyethers).

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Implement detailed unit tests for each rule using known compounds (both positive and negative examples). This will help verify that each rule is correctly coded and that the patterns match the intended structures. For example:

  - Create a test set of molecules known to match or not match each rule.
  - Check that the code returns the expected value (1, -1, or 0) for each molecule and rule.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Enhance code readability and maintainability by adding comments and docstrings that explain the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and the logic behind each rule's implementation. This will help others understand the code and facilitate future modifications.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Consider using RDKit's built-in descriptors and functions where appropriate. For instance:

  - Use `Chem.rdMolDescriptors.CalcNumAliphaticCarbocycles()` to identify aliphatic rings.
  - Use `Chem.rdmolops.GetMolFrags()` to analyze disconnected fragments if applicable.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For complex patterns that are difficult to capture with SMARTS, consider a combination of SMARTS and programmatic checks. For example:

  - First, use a general SMARTS pattern to identify candidate substructures.
  - Then, perform additional checks in the code (e.g., counting specific atom types, verifying distances between atoms) to confirm whether the rule applies.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Performance of the Current Rules Based on the Current Metrics**

After reviewing the current rule metrics in comparison with the reference metrics from previous iterations, we can assess the performance of the current rules by focusing on the **confidence** and **lift** values, as instructed.

---

**1. Confidence**

- **Previous Train Confidence**:
  - **First Iteration**: 0.6352
  - **Second Iteration**: 0.5396
- **Current Train Confidence**:
  - Varies between individual rules, ranging from **0.5413** to **0.7318**
  - **Overall Current Train Confidence**: **0.7030**

**Analysis**:

- The **overall train confidence** has improved from the previous values to **70.3%** in the current iteration.
- **Higher Confidence**: Indicates that when the rule conditions are met, there is a higher probability that the predicted outcome (high or low yield) is correct.
- **Improvement**: An increase from ~63.5% to 70.3% is significant and suggests that the rules are becoming more reliable.

---

**2. Lift**

- **Previous Train Lift**:
  - **First Iteration**: 1.2048
  - **Second Iteration**: 1.0559
- **Current Train Lift**:
  - Ranging from **1.0779** to **1.4659** across individual rules
  - **Overall Current Train Lift**: **1.4051**

**Analysis**:

- **Increased Lift**: The lift has improved from approximately **1.2** to **1.4**.
- **Interpretation**: A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is effective in increasing the likelihood of the predicted outcome compared to random chance.
- **Significance**: The higher lift suggests that the current rules are more valuable in identifying conditions that lead to high or low yields.

---

**3. Support**

- **Previous Train Support**:
  - **First Iteration**: 0.1667
  - **Second Iteration**: 0.1845
- **Current Train Support**:
  - Individual rules range from **0.0** to **0.0686**
  - **Overall Current Train Support**: **0.0429**

**Analysis**:

- **Decreased Support**: The support has decreased from approximately **17%** to **4.3%**.
- **Implication**: The rules apply to a smaller subset of the data.
- **Trade-Off**: Higher confidence and lift have been achieved at the expense of support, indicating that the rules are more precise but less general.

---

**4. Leverage**

- **Previous Train Leverage**:
  - **First Iteration**: 0.0289
  - **Second Iteration**: -0.0041
- **Current Train Leverage**:
  - Ranging from **-0.0003** to **0.0185** across individual rules
  - **Overall Current Train Leverage**: **0.0088**

**Analysis**:

- **Positive Leverage**: Indicates a stronger association between the rule conditions and predictions than would be expected by chance.
- **Moderate Value**: While positive, the leverage is lower than in the first iteration. This suggests that while the rules are effective, there may be room to strengthen the associations further.

---

**Overall Assessment**

- The **current rules have higher confidence and lift**, indicating an improvement in their predictive accuracy and effectiveness.
- The **decreased support** suggests that the rules may be overfitting or too specific, applying to fewer cases.
- The **positive leverage** confirms that the rules are meaningful but could be optimized further for stronger associations.

---

**Determining If a Local Minimum Has Been Reached**

- **Improvement in Metrics**: The increase in confidence and lift suggests that the current iteration has not yet reached a local minimum; progress is still being made.
- **Convergence of Metrics**: Since the metrics are still changing significantly, it's likely that further iterations could continue to improve the rules.
- **Support Consideration**: The sharp decrease in support indicates that the model may need adjustments to avoid becoming too narrow.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

1. **Increase Support Without Sacrificing Confidence and Lift**

   - **Merge Similar Rules**: Examine the current rules for overlap and consider combining them to cover more data points.
   - **Generalize Conditions**: Slightly relax some of the stringent conditions in the rules to include more instances while maintaining high confidence.

2. **Optimize Rule Complexity**

   - **Simplify Rules**: Eliminate unnecessary complexity in the rules that may not contribute significantly to predictive power.
   - **Balance Specificity and Generality**: Find a middle ground where rules are neither too specific (low support) nor too general (low confidence).

3. **Analyze Outliers and Exceptions**

   - **Investigate Low Yield Exceptions**: Look into cases where the rules predict high yield but the actual yield is low, and vice versa, to refine rule conditions.
   - **Incorporate Additional Features**: Consider other molecular descriptors or properties that may improve the rules' predictive capabilities.

4. **Iterative Refinement**

   - **Continue Iterations**: Since metrics are still improving, additional iterations may help reach optimal rules.
   - **Monitor Metrics Closely**: Pay attention to changes in support, confidence, and lift to guide adjustments.

5. **Cross-Validation**

   - **Test Rules on Validation Sets**: Use separate validation data to ensure that the rules generalize well and are not overfitting to the training data.
   - **Assess Overfitting Risk**: A high confidence with low support could be an indicator of overfitting; cross-validation helps detect this.

6. **Incorporate Domain Expertise**

   - **Consult Chemists**: Use insights from experienced chemists to validate the practical relevance of the rules and suggest modifications based on chemical knowledge.
   - **Consider Reaction Mechanisms**: Integrate understanding of underlying reaction mechanisms to refine the rules.

7. **Leverage Advanced Analytical Techniques**

   - **Use Machine Learning Models**: Complement rule-based methods with machine learning techniques to identify complex patterns.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that capture important chemical properties influencing yield.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules show promising improvements in confidence and lift, indicating that they are becoming more effective at predicting yields in the catalytic process. However, the decrease in support highlights the need to ensure that the rules do not become too narrow in scope.

**Next Steps**:

- **Aim to Increase Support**: Work on adjusting the rules to apply to a larger portion of the data without significantly reducing confidence and lift.
- **Continue Iterations**: Proceed with further iterations, focusing on the recommendations provided to enhance rule performance.
- **Balance Metrics**: Strive for a balance between support, confidence, and lift to develop robust and generalizable rules.

By addressing these areas, the rules can be refined to provide valuable guidance in optimizing catalyst modifiers, ultimately contributing to the success of the research program.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

---

**1. Comparison with Previous Metrics**

- **Previous Validation Accuracies**: The prior validation accuracies are consistently high, around **0.76**, with test accuracies of **0.75** and **0.625**.
  
- **Current Validation Accuracy**: The latest 5-fold cross-validation accuracy is **0.6286**.

**2. Observations**

- **Decrease in Accuracy**: The current validation accuracy has decreased compared to previous iterations, indicating that the model's performance has declined.

- **Potential Underfitting**: The lower accuracy suggests the current set of rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns effectively, potentially leading to underfitting.

**3. Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment**

- **Previous High Accuracies**: The consistently high validation accuracies in previous iterations, paired with lower test accuracies (e.g., **0.625**), indicate possible overfitting in earlier models, where the rules fitted the training data too closely but did not generalize well to unseen data.

- **Current Model**: The drop in validation accuracy suggests that the model may now be underfitting, failing to capture essential relationships in the data.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

- **No Improvement Detected**: The accuracy metrics do not suggest an improvement in rule effectiveness. The absence of significant gains in accuracy across iterations implies that a local minimum may have been reached.

---

**SHAP Analysis Insights**

---

**1. Identification of Discrepancies**

- **Overestimations (Predicted High, Experimental Low)**:

  - **Molecules**:
    - **C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
    - **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O**
    - **C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN**

  - **SHAP Values**:
    - **Rule 6** and **Rule 9** have high positive SHAP values, contributing significantly to the incorrect high predictions.

- **Underestimations (Predicted Low, Experimental High)**:

  - **Limited Instances**: In the current iteration, underestimations are not prominent, but previous analyses indicate similar concerns.

**2. Rules with High Impact on Incorrect Predictions**

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with Extensive Fluorination Lead to Low Yield*.

  - **Observation**: Despite Rule 6 predicting low yield for fluorinated compounds, the positive SHAP values indicate that it is contributing to high yield predictions in overestimated cases.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with Flexible Ether Chains Lead to Low Yield*.

  - **Observation**: Similar to Rule 6, Rule 9 shows positive SHAP values in overestimations, suggesting it is influencing the model towards predicting high loading incorrectly.

**3. Interpretation of SHAP Values**

- **Positive SHAP Values in Overestimations**: Rules with positive SHAP values in cases where the model overestimates (predicts high when experimental is low) are likely problematic. They are contributing to incorrect high predictions.

- **Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations**: Conversely, rules with negative SHAP values in cases of underestimation (predicts low when experimental is high) would need adjustment.

**4. Potential Issues with Rules**

- **Misalignment of Rule Predictions**: The positive SHAP values for Rule 6 and Rule 9 in overestimations suggest that these rules are not functioning as intended. Instead of contributing to low yield predictions, they are inadvertently pushing the model towards high yield predictions.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

---

**1. Refinement of Problematic Rules**

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with Extensive Fluorination Lead to Low Yield*.

  - **Action**:
    - **Re-evaluate the Scope**: Ensure that Rule 6 accurately identifies fluorinated compounds and correctly associates them with low yield.
    - **Check Implementation**: Verify that the rule is implemented correctly in the feature matrix, capturing all relevant modifiers without false positives.
    - **Adjust Rule Parameters**: Consider if the definition of "extensive fluorination" requires refinement to exclude compounds incorrectly influenced by this rule.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with Flexible Ether Chains Lead to Low Yield*.

  - **Action**:
    - **Clarify Definitions**: Define "flexible ether chains" more precisely to prevent misclassification.
    - **Update Rule Logic**: Modify the rule to focus on ethers that genuinely contribute to low yield, excluding those that do not affect the outcome adversely.
    - **Feature Engineering**: Introduce additional criteria or sub-rules to distinguish between different types of ether-containing compounds.

**2. Addressing Overfitting and Underfitting**

- **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**:

  - **Complexity Reduction**: Simplify rules that are too specific and may cause overfitting. Generalize where appropriate to improve the model's ability to capture broader patterns.

- **Enhance Underrepresented Features**:

  - **Data Augmentation**: If certain features or compound classes are underrepresented, consider augmenting the dataset or adjusting rules to balance the feature representation.

**3. Improve Generalization**

- **Introduce New Rules**:

  - **Gap Analysis**: Identify areas where the current rules do not adequately cover the data, especially for compounds leading to incorrect predictions.
  - **Novel Patterns**: Look for new patterns or relationships in the data that could be translated into additional rules.

- **Rule Interaction Consideration**:

  - **Rule Hierarchy**: Establish a hierarchy or weighting system for rules to resolve conflicts when multiple rules apply to a single compound.
  - **Combination Rules**: Develop rules that consider the interaction between different functional groups or structural elements.

**4. Utilize SHAP Insights for Iterative Refinement**

- **Focus on High Impact Rules**:

  - **Prioritize Adjustment**: Give priority to refining rules with the highest SHAP values in incorrect predictions, as they have the most significant impact on model performance.

- **Iterative Testing and Validation**:

  - **Reassess After Changes**: After modifying rules, rerun the model and SHAP analysis to assess the impact of changes.
  - **Continuous Improvement**: Use a cyclical process of refinement, validation, and analysis to incrementally improve the model.

---

**Detailed Suggestions Based on SHAP Analysis**

---

**1. Rule 6 Refinement**

- **Issue**: Rule 6 is contributing to high predictions when it should predict low yield due to extensive fluorination.
  
- **Solution**:

  - **Revise Criteria**: Tighten the criteria for what constitutes "extensive fluorination." Specify the minimum number of fluorine atoms or the degree of fluorination required.

  - **Exclude Exceptions**: Identify and exclude compounds where fluorination does not lead to low yield, preventing the rule from misclassifying them.

**2. Rule 9 Adjustment**

- **Issue**: Rule 9 is not effectively capturing modifiers with flexible ether chains, leading to incorrect high yield predictions.
  
- **Solution**:

  - **Define "Flexible"**: Clearly define what makes an ether chain "flexible" (e.g., chain length, number of ether linkages).

  - **Add Structural Constraints**: Incorporate additional structural requirements to differentiate between ethers that impact yield negatively and those that do not.

**3. Re-evaluating Rule Impact**

- **Assess Rule Overlaps**: Check for overlaps between rules that may cause conflicting contributions to the prediction.

- **Adjust Rule Weighting**: Consider assigning different weights to rules based on their reliability, as indicated by SHAP values.

**4. General Recommendations**

- **Expand Dataset Diversity**:

  - **Include More Examples**: If possible, expand the dataset with additional compounds, especially those that are mispredicted, to provide more instances for the model to learn from.

- **Regularize the Model**:

  - **Prevent Overfitting**: Implement techniques such as regularization to ensure the model does not overfit to the training data.

- **Cross-Validation Strategies**:

  - **Stratified Sampling**: Use stratified cross-validation to maintain the distribution of high and low yield modifiers across folds.

- **Feature Engineering Enhancements**:

  - **Create New Features**: Develop new features that capture relevant chemical properties not currently represented.

  - **Feature Selection**: Evaluate which features (rules) contribute most to accurate predictions and consider removing or modifying less effective ones.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules is not performing as effectively as desired, with a validation accuracy of **62.86%**, a decrease from previous iterations. The SHAP analysis has identified **Rule 6** and **Rule 9** as contributing to overestimations in the model's predictions. Refining these rules by clarifying their definitions and adjusting their implementation can improve model performance.

To enhance the model further, it's crucial to address both overfitting and underfitting by simplifying complex rules, ensuring adequate feature representation, and improving generalization through the introduction of new, well-defined rules. Iteratively refining the rules based on SHAP insights and continuously validating their performance will lead to a more accurate and robust predictive model.

---

**Next Steps**

1. **Implement the suggested refinements** to Rule 6 and Rule 9, and re-evaluate the model's performance.

2. **Conduct further SHAP analysis** after adjustments to ensure the changes have the desired effect.

3. **Continue iterative refinement**, focusing on other rules that may contribute to prediction errors as identified in ongoing analyses.

By systematically addressing the issues highlighted and leveraging the insights from SHAP analysis, we can improve the predictive capabilities of the model and enhance our understanding of the factors influencing modifier loading on catalysts.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

**1. Overview of Current Situation**

You are working on optimizing and controlling the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The reaction uses various molecular modifiers, and you aim to extract rules that predict whether a given modifier will lead to a high or low yield.

During the iterations of your program, you have developed a set of 14 rules based on structural features of the modifiers. However, recent analyses indicate that the current rules may not be fully optimized:

- **Accuracy Metrics**: The validation accuracy has decreased from previous iterations (from around 76% to approximately 62.86%). This suggests that the predictive power of the rules has diminished.
- **SHAP Analysis**: Certain rules, particularly **Rule 6** and **Rule 9**, are contributing to incorrect predictions (overestimations of yield). This indicates that these rules may not be correctly capturing the intended structural features or are misclassifying certain modifiers.

**2. Key Issues Identified**

- **Rule Implementation Gaps**: Not all 14 rules have been fully implemented in the code, limiting the model's coverage and effectiveness.
- **Specific Rule Issues**:
  - **Rule 2**: Potential inaccuracies in identifying para-substituted positions on aromatic rings due to variable atom indexing.
  - **Rule 3**: The SMARTS pattern may not adequately capture heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen heterocycles.
  - **Rule 4**: The code may be too restrictive by only considering hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid carbon, rather than near it.
  - **Rule 5**: Possible miscalculations in chain length and failure to exclude modifiers with additional polar functional groups.
  - **Rule 6** and **Rule 9**: These rules are incorrectly contributing to high yield predictions when they should predict low yield, leading to overestimations.

- **Metric Analysis**:
  - **Support Decrease**: The support for the rules has decreased, indicating that the rules apply to fewer instances.
  - **Overfitting/Underfitting**: The lower validation accuracy and high confidence in certain predictions suggest potential overfitting or underfitting.

**3. Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

**Implement All 14 Rules Completely**

- **Action**: Ensure that all 14 rules are fully implemented in the code to maximize coverage and predictive power.

**Refine Individual Rules**

- **Rule 2**: Modify the code to accurately identify para-substituted positions on aromatic rings regardless of atom indexing.

  - **Approach**:
    - Identify the position of the carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring.
    - Use distance matrices (`Chem.GetDistanceMatrix()`) to find the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.
    - Check for coordinating functional groups at the para position.

- **Rule 3**: Improve the SMARTS patterns to better capture heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen heterocycles.

  - **Approach**:
    - Generalize the SMARTS pattern to include various nitrogen-containing heterocycles.
    - Ensure the pattern matches carboxylic acids directly attached to the heterocycle.

- **Rule 4**: Expand the scope to include hydroxyl groups near (not just adjacent to) the carboxylic acid.

  - **Approach**:
    - Use recursive SMARTS patterns or graph traversal to find hydroxyl groups within a certain bond distance from the carboxylic acid.
    - Include both aliphatic chains and cyclic structures.

- **Rule 5**: Accurately calculate aliphatic chain lengths and exclude modifiers with additional polar functional groups.

  - **Approach**:
    - Use functions like `Chem.FindAllPathsOfLengthN()` to find chains of specific lengths.
    - Explicitly check for the absence of other polar groups using SMARTS patterns that exclude non-carbon/hydrogen atoms (excluding the carboxylic acid).

**Address Misleading Contributions from Rules**

- **Rule 6**: Clarify and tighten the criteria for "extensive fluorination" to prevent incorrect high yield predictions.

  - **Approach**:
    - Define a threshold for the number of fluorine atoms or the degree of fluorination.
    - Ensure the rule accurately reflects the electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine on metal coordination.

- **Rule 9**: Redefine what constitutes "flexible ether chains" and adjust the rule to prevent misclassification.

  - **Approach**:
    - Specify the minimum number of ether linkages or chain length that impacts yield.
    - Differentiate between ethers that influence yield negatively and those that do not.

**Improve Rule Precision and Coverage**

- **Generalization**: Slightly relax overly stringent conditions in some rules to increase support without significantly reducing confidence.

- **Combining Rules**: Merge overlapping rules where appropriate to cover more instances and reduce redundancy.

- **New Features**: Incorporate additional molecular descriptors or properties that may influence yield, such as steric hindrance factors or electronic properties.

**Enhance Code Quality and Testing**

- **Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests for each rule using known examples to validate correctness.

- **Documentation**: Add comments and explanations in the code to improve readability and facilitate future modifications.

- **Leverage RDKit Functions**: Utilize built-in RDKit descriptors and functions to simplify code and improve accuracy.

**Ensure Balanced Model Performance**

- **Avoid Overfitting/Underfitting**: Monitor model complexity to maintain a balance between underfitting and overfitting.

- **Cross-Validation**: Use stratified cross-validation techniques to maintain distribution balance and assess model generalization.

- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously refine the rules based on performance metrics and SHAP analysis.

**Utilize SHAP Analysis for Targeted Improvements**

- **Identify High-Impact Rules**: Focus on refining rules that contribute most to incorrect predictions, as highlighted by high SHAP values in misclassified instances.

- **Adjust Rule Weightings**: Consider weighting rules differently based on their reliability and impact on predictions.

**Incorporate Domain Expertise**

- **Chemical Insights**: Consult with chemists to validate the practical relevance of the rules and ensure they align with chemical intuition and reaction mechanisms.

**Judgment on Possibility for Further Optimization**

Based on the analysis and suggestions provided, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The inaccuracies and misclassifications observed, particularly associated with specific rules, indicate that refinement and careful adjustment can enhance model performance and predictive accuracy.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Extensive Fluorination Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers in which multiple hydrogen atoms on an alkyl chain are replaced with fluorine atoms, leading to heavily fluorinated chains.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density, reducing the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with metal ions. Fluorinated chains are also hydrophobic, which can diminish solubility and interaction with the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)
  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Compound **28**)

- **Description**: Modifiers that have carbonyl-containing groups (aldehyde **–CHO** or ketone **–C=O**) directly attached to the aromatic ring or adjacent to the carboxylic acid group.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde and ketone groups are electron-withdrawing and can interfere with metal coordination, deactivating the catalyst and reducing yield.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Compound **27**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Compound **25**, High Yield; methoxy groups may offset electron withdrawal, and the ketone is positioned away from coordination sites)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing amide groups (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group or within the main chain of the molecule.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide bonds can delocalize lone pair electrons through resonance, reducing the availability of nitrogen and oxygen atoms for metal coordination. This weakens interactions with the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Compound **23**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Flexible Ether Chains Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that contain internal ether linkages (**–O–**) within flexible aliphatic chains, such as polyethers.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms are less effective for coordination due to their position within flexible chains. Increased molecular flexibility can reduce effective binding to metal centers because of entropic penalties.

- **Example**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Sulfhydryl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that contain a sulfhydryl group (**–SH**) on a short aliphatic chain, along with a carboxyl group.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal coordination due to the polarizability of sulfur's lone pair electrons. Short chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing effective interaction with metal centers.

- **Example**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**, Low Yield; the aromatic ring may delocalize sulfur's lone pair electrons, reducing coordination ability)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers That Are Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Heteroatoms Lead to High Yield**

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups on Aromatic Rings Lead to Low Yield, Except for Nitro Groups at the Para Position**

- **Description**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., aldehyde, formyl, fluorine) on aromatic rings generally reduce yield. However, modifiers with nitro groups (**–NO₂**) at the para position can result in high yield due to specific electronic effects.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, hindering metal coordination. The nitro group's resonance structures may enhance specific interactions with metal centers despite its electron-withdrawing nature.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)
  - **High Yield**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups generally result in **low yield**, but para-nitrobenzoic acid is an exception and results in **high yield**.

These rules provide a comprehensive framework to predict whether a molecular modifier will lead to a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By analyzing combinations of functional groups and structural features, the rules consider underlying physico-chemical properties such as:

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups like amino, hydroxy, and heterocyclic nitrogen enhance metal coordination.
- **Steric Factors**: Short aliphatic chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating effective interaction with the catalyst.
- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density, while electron-withdrawing groups decrease it, affecting metal coordination.
- **Chelation**: Multiple binding sites (e.g., adjacent hydroxyl or carbonyl groups) can chelate metal ions, stabilizing the catalyst complex.
- **Hydrophobicity and Solubility**: Chain length and polar groups influence solubility and interaction with the catalyst.

**Coverage and Balance**:

- **Broad Coverage**: The rules encompass a wide range of functional groups and structural motifs present in the dataset, including amino acids, aromatic compounds, aliphatic acids, heterocycles, and various substituents.
- **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**: The set includes simple rules with high coverage (e.g., modifiers with amino and carboxylic groups on short chains) and more complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., modifiers with unique aromatic systems capable of chelation).
- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule provides clear criteria for predicting high or low yield, aiding in the selection and design of effective modifiers.

By applying these rules, chemists can make informed decisions in selecting molecular modifiers to optimize the yield of the target reaction, advancing the goals of the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Ensure Full Implementation of All 14 Rules**

  - *Action*: Review the existing code to confirm that all 14 rules are fully implemented. Implement any missing rules to maximize coverage and predictive power.
  - *Practical Steps*:
    - Audit the code to identify any unimplemented or partially implemented rules.
    - Write code for any missing rules, ensuring they align with the rule descriptions.
    - Validate each rule individually with known examples and counterexamples.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rule 2 to Accurately Identify Para-Substituted Aromatic Carboxylic Acids**

  - *Issue*: Incorrect identification of para-substituted positions due to variable atom indexing.
  - *Practical Steps*:
    - Use RDKit's distance matrix (`Chem.GetDistanceMatrix()`) to determine relative positions on the aromatic ring.
    - Implement a function to locate the carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring.
    - Calculate bond distances to identify the para position (typically four bonds away).
    - Check for coordinating functional groups (e.g., –NH₂, –OH, –OCH₃, pyridyl groups) at the para position, regardless of atom indexing.
    - Example Code Snippet:
      ```python
      from rdkit import Chem
      mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles('c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)N')
      dm = Chem.GetDistanceMatrix(mol)
      carboxylic_acid_indices = [atom.GetIdx() for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6 and atom.GetTotalNumHs() == 0 and any([bond.GetBondTypeAsDouble() == 2.0 for bond in atom.GetBonds()])]
      for idx in carboxylic_acid_indices:
          for atom_idx, distance in enumerate(dm[idx]):
              if distance == 4:
                  atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(atom_idx)
                  if atom.GetAtomicNum() in [7, 8] and any([neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 1 for neighbor in atom.GetNeighbors()]):
                      # Para-substituted coordinating group found
                      pass
      ```

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance Rule 3 to Better Capture Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Heterocycles**

  - *Issue*: SMARTS patterns may not adequately capture all relevant heterocycles.
  - *Practical Steps*:
    - Expand SMARTS patterns to include various nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyridine, pyrazole, pyrimidine, and imidazole.
    - Ensure the carboxylic acid group is directly attached to the heterocycle.
    - Example SMARTS Patterns:
      - Pyridine carboxylic acid: `n1ccccc1C(=O)[OH]`
      - Pyrazole carboxylic acid: `n1nccc1C(=O)[OH]`
    - Update code to search for these patterns using RDKit's `HasSubstructMatch()` function.

- **Advice 4**: **Adjust Rule 4 to Include Hydroxyl Groups Near the Carboxylic Acid Group**

  - *Issue*: Current code may be too restrictive by only considering hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid carbon.
  - *Practical Steps*:
    - Modify SMARTS patterns to find hydroxyl groups within a certain bond distance (e.g., two or three bonds) from the carboxylic acid group.
    - Use recursive SMARTS patterns or graph traversal methods to identify nearby hydroxyl groups.
    - Include both linear and cyclic structures in the search criteria.
    - Example SMARTS Pattern:
      - Aliphatic polyol structures: `C(=O)[OH][CX4][CX4][OH]`
    - Implement code to check for multiple hydroxyl groups within the specified bond distance.

- **Advice 5**: **Accurately Calculate Chain Lengths and Exclude Modifiers with Additional Polar Groups in Rule 5**

  - *Issue*: Miscalculations in chain length and failure to exclude modifiers with additional polar functional groups.
  - *Practical Steps*:
    - Use RDKit functions like `Chem.GetMolFrags()` and `Chem.GetShortestPath()` to calculate the chain length from the carboxylic acid carbon to the terminal carbon.
    - Ensure modifiers have chain lengths between 6 to 8 carbons.
    - Exclude molecules containing additional polar functional groups (e.g., –OH, –NH₂) by checking the absence of heteroatoms other than oxygen in the carboxyl group.
    - Example Code Snippet:
      ```python
      from rdkit.Chem import rdqueries
      mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles('CCCCCCC(=O)O')  # Example molecule
      pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts('C(=O)[OH]CCCCCC')
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern):
          # Check for absence of additional heteroatoms
          heteroatoms = [atom for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.GetAtomicNum() not in [1, 6, 8]]
          if len(heteroatoms) == 0:
              # Modifier fits the rule
              pass
      ```

- **Advice 6**: **Clarify and Tighten Criteria in Rule 6 for Extensive Fluorination**

  - *Issue*: Rule may be incorrectly predicting high yield due to vague definition of "extensive fluorination."
  - *Practical Steps*:
    - Define a specific threshold for extensive fluorination, such as a molecule having fluorine atoms attached to more than half of the carbon atoms.
    - Implement code to count the number of fluorine atoms and compare it to the number of carbon atoms.
    - Example Code Snippet:
      ```python
      num_carbons = len([atom for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6])
      num_fluorines = len([atom for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 9])
      if num_fluorines / num_carbons > 0.5:
          # Modifier is extensively fluorinated
          pass
      ```

- **Advice 7**: **Redefine Rule 9 to Prevent Misclassification Due to Flexible Ether Chains**

  - *Issue*: Rule may be misclassifying modifiers due to ambiguous definition of "flexible ether chains."
  - *Practical Steps*:
    - Specify a minimum number of ether linkages (e.g., more than two ether bonds) to define a flexible ether chain.
    - Use SMARTS patterns that match polyether chains with internal ether linkages.
    - Example SMARTS Pattern:
      - Flexible ether chain: `C(-O-C(-O-C(-O-C)))`
    - Implement checks to count ether linkages and assess chain flexibility.

- **Advice 8**: **Implement Unit Tests for Each Rule**

  - *Practical Steps*:
    - Create test cases with known outcomes for each rule, including both positive and negative examples.
    - Use a unit testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest` in Python.
    - Validate that each rule correctly classifies the test cases.
    - Automate the testing process to ensure reliability with code changes.

- **Advice 9**: **Improve Code Quality with Documentation and Utilization of RDKit Functions**

  - *Practical Steps*:
    - Add clear comments explaining the logic and purpose of each code block and function.
    - Use descriptive variable names to enhance readability.
    - Leverage RDKit's built-in functions, such as `Chem.MolFromSmarts()`, `rdMolDescriptors.CalcNumHeteroatoms()`, and others.
    - Refactor code to remove redundant or custom implementations where RDKit provides a solution.

- **Advice 10**: **Monitor Model Performance and Prevent Overfitting or Underfitting**

  - *Practical Steps*:
    - Split the dataset into training and validation sets using stratified sampling to maintain class balance.
    - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
    - Adjust rules based on validation performance, avoiding overly complex rules that may overfit.
    - Implement cross-validation to assess the model's generalizability.

- **Advice 11**: **Utilize SHAP Analysis to Identify and Refine High-Impact Rules**

  - *Practical Steps*:
    - Use SHAP values to determine which rules contribute most to incorrect predictions.
    - Focus efforts on refining these rules to improve overall model accuracy.
    - Adjust rule thresholds, conditions, or patterns based on insights from SHAP analysis.
    - Reassess the impact of these changes on model performance.

- **Advice 12**: **Incorporate Domain Expertise to Validate and Enhance Rules**

  - *Practical Steps*:
    - Consult with chemists or subject matter experts to verify the chemical validity of the rules.
    - Discuss the underlying physico-chemical properties and reaction mechanisms associated with each rule.
    - Make adjustments to the rules based on expert feedback to align them with chemical principles.
    - Consider the real-world applicability and practicality of the rules.

- **Advice 13**: **Consider Merging Overlapping Rules to Improve Efficiency**

  - *Practical Steps*:
    - Identify rules that cover similar structural features or functional groups.
    - Evaluate the potential for combining these rules to simplify the rule set.
    - Ensure that the merged rules maintain clarity and do not reduce predictive accuracy.
    - Update the code and documentation to reflect the merged rules.

- **Advice 14**: **Explore Additional Molecular Descriptors to Enhance Rule Precision**

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** demonstrates high **clarity**, as the structural description—modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups on short aliphatic chains (2 to 5 carbons)—allows for clear prediction of high yield when a modifier fits this description. The **property insight** is strong, explaining that multiple coordination sites from amino and carboxyl groups enhance metal complex formation, and short chains reduce steric hindrance. The rule considers a combination of sub-structures (**complexity**), including functional groups and chain length. With multiple **examples** (Compounds 0, 2, 3) and **counterexamples** (Compounds 31, 34), the rule has good **coverage** supported by sufficient data points.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** is highly **clear** in specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of metal coordination lead to high yield. The **property insight** is adequate, highlighting that para-substituents enhance electron density and provide additional coordination sites. The rule involves combinations of sub-structures (**complexity**), such as the aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, and functional groups at the para position. It is supported by several **examples** (Compounds 4, 24, 7) and notes **counterexamples** (Compound 20 and an exception with Compound 21), indicating strong **coverage**.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** has good **clarity**, describing modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups near carboxylic acid groups leading to high yield. The **property insight** is sound, explaining that such structures can chelate metal ions effectively. It combines multiple functional groups (**complexity**) by involving polyol systems adjacent to carboxyl groups. While it provides **examples** (Compounds 9, 6), the **coverage** is moderate due to fewer data points and a lack of counterexamples.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** offers clear guidelines, stating that modifiers with heterocyclic nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination lead to high yield. The **property insight** is valid, noting that nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate with metal ions to enhance complex stability. The rule considers specific sub-structures (**complexity**), such as nitrogen-containing heterocycles and carboxylic acids. It includes several **examples** (Compounds 22, 16, 8) and a **counterexample** (Compound 12), providing strong **coverage**.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** provides **clarity** by specifying that modifiers with sulfhydryl groups on short chains lead to high yield. The **property insight** is acceptable, mentioning that sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands due to sulfur's electron pair. The rule combines functional groups (**complexity**) by involving sulfhydryl and carboxyl groups on short chains. It includes an **example** (Compound 18) and a **counterexample** (Compound 10), but the **coverage** is somewhat limited due to fewer data points.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** lacks sufficient **clarity** because it appears contradictory to previous observations (e.g., Rule 1's counterexamples with longer chains leading to low yield). The **property insight** is speculative and not well-supported, suggesting that long aliphatic chains without additional polar groups result in high yield due to improved interactions with hydrophobic regions. The rule has minimal **complexity**, involving simple aliphatic chains and carboxylic acids. With only one **example** (Compound 5) and inconsistent **counterexamples** (Compounds 29, 34), the **coverage** is weak, and the validity of this rule is questionable.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** is **clear**, stating that modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to carboxylic acid groups lead to low yield. The **property insight** is strong, explaining that electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density at coordination sites. The rule considers combinations of functional groups (**complexity**), such as electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to carboxyl groups. It is supported by multiple **examples** (Compounds 20, 19, 14), providing good **coverage**, although addressing exceptions like Compound 21 would strengthen it further.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** has good **clarity**, indicating that modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to carboxylic acid groups lead to low yield. The **property insight** is reasonable, noting that amide groups may reduce the availability of coordination sites due to resonance delocalization. The rule involves specific sub-structures (**complexity**), such as amide linkages near carboxyl groups. With **examples** (Compounds 33, 26) and no counterexamples, the **coverage** is adequate but could be enhanced with additional data points.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** is **clear** in stating that modifiers with flexible polyether chains lead to low yield. The **property insight** is acceptable, mentioning that increased flexibility and weak coordination of ether oxygens reduce catalytic effectiveness. The rule considers a combination of structural features (**complexity**), such as internal ether linkages in aliphatic chains. It includes one **example** (Compound 11) but lacks counterexamples, resulting in limited **coverage**.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** is reasonably **clear**, focusing on amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains leading to high yield. The **property insight** overlaps with previous rules but emphasizes the significance of nitrogen heterocycles in amino acid side chains. The rule adds **complexity** by considering specific amino acid structures. It provides an **example** (Compound 15) and a **counterexample** (Compound 13), supporting moderate **coverage**.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** offers **clarity**, stating that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yield. The **property insight** is acceptable, suggesting that such carbonyl groups can sequester metal ions. The rule considers combinations of functional groups (**complexity**), like carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxyl groups. With an **example** (Compound 27) but no counterexamples, the **coverage** is limited.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** is **clear** in indicating that modifiers with aromatic systems capable of chelation lead to high yield. The **property insight** is adequate, emphasizing that chelation enhances metal complex stability. The rule involves complex sub-structures (**complexity**), such as adjacent donor groups on aromatic systems. However, it provides only one **example** (Compound 17) and lacks counterexamples, resulting in minimal **coverage**.

- **Comment 13**:

  **Rule 13** demonstrates good **clarity**, explaining that modifiers with bulky substituents near coordination sites lead to low yield due to steric hindrance. The **property insight** is strong, highlighting how steric factors can hinder effective coordination. The rule considers combinations of structural features (**complexity**), such as bulky groups near functional sites. It includes **examples** (Compounds 13, 33) without counterexamples, providing moderate **coverage**.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers Containing Both Amino and Carboxylic Acid Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains (2 to 5 Carbons) Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that feature both an amino group (**–NH₂**) and at least one carboxyl group (**–COOH**) on a straight-chain aliphatic backbone consisting of 2 to 5 carbon atoms.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The presence of amino and carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing the formation of stable complexes with the catalyst. Short chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating effective interaction with the metal center.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

- **Counterexamples**:
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**; Low Yield—longer chain increases flexibility and reduces coordination efficiency)
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**; Low Yield—chain length exceeds optimal range)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituents Capable of Metal Coordination Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with functional groups at the para position that can act as Lewis bases or coordinate with metal centers—such as amino (**–NH₂**), hydroxy (**–OH**), or pyridyl groups.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Para-substituents enhance electron density and provide additional coordination sites, improving interaction with the metal center.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Compound **24**)
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)

- **Counterexamples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**; Low Yield—the aldehyde group is electron-withdrawing)
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**; Exception—though nitro is electron-withdrawing, this compound gives high yield)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description generally result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Near Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing several hydroxyl groups (**–OH**) in close proximity to carboxyl groups, either on aliphatic chains or cyclic structures, forming polyol systems.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal ions effectively, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers with Heterocyclic Nitrogen Atoms Capable of Metal Coordination Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that include nitrogen-containing heterocycles where the nitrogen atom is available for coordination with metal centers, such as pyridine or pyrazole rings.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate with metal ions, enhancing complex stability.

- **Examples**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**; Low Yield—possible steric hindrance or reduced availability of nitrogen for coordination)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description usually result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Sulfhydryl Groups on Short Chains Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing a sulfhydryl group (**–SH**) near the carboxyl group on a short aliphatic chain.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal ions due to the polarizability of sulfur's electron pair.

- **Example**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**; Low Yield—the aromatic ring may diminish sulfur's coordinating ability)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Long Aliphatic Chains Without Additional Polar Functional Groups Result in High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and no other functional groups besides the terminal carboxyl group.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: These modifiers may improve interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or facilitate better substrate accessibility.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

- **Counterexamples**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**; Low Yield—additional hydroxyl group alters properties)
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**; Low Yield—additional amino group may introduce undesired interactions)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers featuring electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., aldehyde, keto, fluorinated groups) adjacent to the carboxyl group or on the aromatic ring.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density at coordination sites, weakening interaction with metal centers.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers Containing Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers with amide linkages (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group or within the main chain.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups may delocalize electron density through resonance, reducing the availability of the nitrogen or oxygen atoms for effective metal coordination.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Flexible Polyether Chains Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing internal ether linkages (**–O–**) within flexible aliphatic chains, such as polyethylene glycol derivatives.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Increased flexibility can reduce effective coordination due to entropic effects, and ether oxygens may not coordinate strongly with metal centers.

- **Example**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Nitrogen-Containing Aromatic Side Chains Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Amino acids with aromatic side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles capable of metal coordination.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen in heterocycles offers coordination sites, enhancing catalyst interaction.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**; Low Yield—no coordinating nitrogen in side chain)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Ketone Groups on Aliphatic Chains Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers having carbonyl groups (**–C=O**) such as aldehydes or ketones on aliphatic chains adjacent to carboxyl groups.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Carbonyl groups can engage in competing interactions and may sequester metal ions through undesired coordination, reducing catalyst activity.

- **Example**:
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Compound **27**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Aromatic Systems Capable of Chelation Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing aromatic systems with adjacent donor groups (e.g., hydroxyl and carbonyl) capable of chelating metal centers.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Chelation enhances the stability of metal complexes and improves catalytic efficiency.

- **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Bulky Substituents Near Coordination Sites Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that have large, bulky groups near potential coordination sites, which can hinder effective interaction with the metal center due to steric hindrance.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Steric hindrance prevents optimal alignment and binding of the modifier to the catalyst, reducing catalytic activity.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules provide a structured approach to predict whether a molecular modifier will lead to a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By focusing on combinations of sub-structures and functional groups, and considering the underlying physico-chemical properties, the rules help in selecting appropriate modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.

**Coverage and Balance**:

- **Broad Coverage**: The rules encompass modifiers with amino acids, aromatic compounds, aliphatic chains, heterocycles, and various functional groups.

- **Simplicity and Complexity**: The set includes simple rules with broad coverage (e.g., Rule 1 on amino and carboxylic acids on short chains) and more complex rules with narrower focus (e.g., Rule 12 on aromatic systems capable of chelation).

- **Predictive Power**: Each rule provides clear criteria for predicting high or low yield, aiding in decision-making for catalyst modification.

By applying these rules, chemists can make informed choices in the design and selection of molecular modifiers to enhance the yield of the target reaction, contributing to the success of the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Modify Rule 1 Code to Correctly Identify Amino Acids with Short Aliphatic Chains**

  **Issue**: The current code for Rule 1 does not correctly identify molecules like L-Glutamic acid and L-Aspartic acid, which should match this rule. The code counts the number of carbons between the amino group and the carboxylic acid group by examining the shortest path, but it may exclude the alpha carbon or improperly handle branching.

  **Improvement**: Adjust the `rule1` function to correctly count the number of carbons in the aliphatic chain by including the alpha carbon and ensuring that branching is considered. Use more precise SMARTS patterns to identify amino acids with aliphatic chains of 2 to 5 carbons.

  **Revised Code**:
  ```python
  def rule1(mol):
      # Identify amino acids with both amino and carboxylic acid groups on an aliphatic chain of 2 to 5 carbons
      patterns = Chem.MolFromSmarts('NCC(C)C(=O)O')  # Simplified pattern for amino acids
      chain_length = 0
      for path in mol.GetSubstructMatches(patterns):
          chain_atoms = [mol.GetAtomWithIdx(idx) for idx in path]
          carbons_in_chain = [atom for atom in chain_atoms if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6]
          chain_length = len(carbons_in_chain)
          if 2 <= chain_length <= 5:
              return 1
      return 0
  ```
  
- **Suggestion 2**: **Revise Rule 2 Code to Accurately Detect Para-Substituted Aromatic Carboxylic Acids**

  **Issue**: The current code for Rule 2 fails to match compounds like 4-aminobenzoic acid. The code only checks for benzoic acid with substituents directly attached, but may miss cases where coordinating groups are connected via a methylene spacer or extended structures.

  **Improvement**: Update the `rule2` function to include substituents at the para position, even if they are part of larger functional groups, and check for coordinating atoms (N, O) in the substituents.

  **Revised Code**:
  ```python
  def rule2(mol):
      # Detect para-substituted benzoic acid derivatives with coordinating groups
      pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O')
      matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(pattern)
      for match in matches:
          ring_atom_indices = match[:-2]  # Exclude the carboxylic acid atoms
          para_atom_idx = ring_atom_indices[3]
          para_atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(para_atom_idx)
          for neighbor in para_atom.GetNeighbors():
              if neighbor.GetIdx() not in ring_atom_indices:
                  if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() in [7, 8]:  # Nitrogen or oxygen
                      return 1
      return 0
  ```
  
- **Suggestion 3**: **Enhance Rule 3 Code to Identify Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Near Carboxylic Acid**

  **Issue**: The current code for Rule 3 may not effectively identify modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid group, especially in cyclic structures or sugars.

  **Improvement**: Modify the `rule3` function to consider ring systems and ensure that the proximity of hydroxyl groups to the carboxylic acid is accurately assessed, perhaps by using a distance threshold rather than path length.

  **Revised Code**:
  ```python
  def rule3(mol):
      # Identify molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups within 2 bonds of a carboxylic acid
      carboxylic_acid_atoms = [atom_idx for atom_idx in mol.GetSubstructMatches(carboxylic_acid_pattern)]
      hydroxyl_atoms = [atom_idx[0] for atom_idx in mol.GetSubstructMatches(hydroxyl_group_pattern)]
      for c_idx in carboxylic_acid_atoms:
          hydroxyl_count = 0
          for h_idx in hydroxyl_atoms:
              if h_idx != c_idx:
                  path_length = len(Chem.GetShortestPath(mol, c_idx[0], h_idx))
                  if path_length <= 3:
                      hydroxyl_count += 1
          if hydroxyl_count >= 2:
              return 1
      return 0
  ```
  
- **Suggestion 4**: **Correct Rule 4 Code to Accurately Match Heterocyclic Nitrogen-Containing Modifiers**

  **Issue**: The current code for Rule 4 may not detect modifiers like nicotinic acid, where the nitrogen is part of a pyridine ring directly attached to the carboxylic acid group.

  **Improvement**: Adjust the `rule4` function to include pyridine and pyrazole rings that are directly attached to the carboxylic acid, ensuring that the nitrogen atom is available for coordination.

  **Revised Code**:
  ```python
  def rule4(mol):
      # Detect carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles
      pyridine_carboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('n1ccccc1C(=O)O')
      pyrazole_carboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1c[nH]ncc1C(=O)O')
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pyridine_carboxylic_acid) or mol.HasSubstructMatch(pyrazole_carboxylic_acid):
          return 1
      return 0
  ```
  
- **Suggestion 5**: **Refine Rule 5 Code to Identify Short-Chain Sulfhydryl-Containing Modifiers**

  **Issue**: The current code for Rule 5 may incorrectly identify molecules due to not accurately measuring the chain length between the sulfhydryl group and the carboxylic acid.

  **Improvement**: Enhance the `rule5` function to count the number of carbons in the chain between the sulfhydryl and carboxylic acid groups and ensure they are on a straight aliphatic chain.

  **Revised Code**:
  ```python
  def rule5(mol):
      # Identify modifiers with sulfhydryl groups near carboxylic acid on short chains
      thiol_atoms = [atom_idx[0] for atom_idx in mol.GetSubstructMatches(thiol_pattern)]
      carboxylic_acid_atoms = [atom_idx[0] for atom_idx in mol.GetSubstructMatches(carboxylic_acid_pattern)]
      for s_idx in thiol_atoms:
          for c_idx in carboxylic_acid_atoms:
              path = Chem.GetShortestPath(mol, s_idx, c_idx)
              if path:
                  carbon_count = sum(1 for idx in path[1:-1] if mol.GetAtomWithIdx(idx).GetAtomicNum() == 6)
                  if 1 <= carbon_count <= 5:
                      return 1
      return 0
  ```
  
- **Suggestion 6**: **Improve Rule 6 Code by Excluding Molecules with Additional Functional Groups**

  **Issue**: The current code for Rule 6 may not exclude molecules that have additional polar functional groups besides the terminal carboxyl group.

  **Improvement**: Update the `rule6` function to check for other heteroatoms (N, O, S, halogens) in the molecule, ensuring that only straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups are identified.

  **Revised Code**:
  ```python
  def rule6(mol):
      # Detect straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with 6 to 8 carbons and no other functional groups
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(carboxylic_acid_pattern):
          num_carbons = sum(1 for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6 and not atom.IsAromatic())
          num_heteroatoms = sum(1 for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.GetAtomicNum() in [7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 17, 35, 53])
          if 6 <= num_carbons <= 8 and num_heteroatoms == 2:  # Two oxygens from carboxylic acid
              return 1
      return 0
  ```
  
- **Suggestion 7**: **Adjust Rule 7 Code to Properly Identify Electron-Withdrawing Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid**

  **Issue**: The current code might miss compounds where electron-withdrawing groups are adjacent to the carboxylic acid due to limited patterns.

  **Improvement**: Expand the `rule7` function to include more electron-withdrawing groups such as cyano, nitro, and halogens adjacent to the carboxylic acid group.

  **Revised Code**:
  ```python
  def rule7(mol):
      # Identify electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to carboxylic acid
      ewgs = ['[CX3H1](=O)[#6]', '[#6][CX3](=O)[#6]', '[CX4][F,Cl,Br,I]', '[NX3+](=O)[O-]', '[CX2]#N']  # Aldehyde, ketone, halogens, nitro, cyano
      ewg_patterns = [Chem.MolFromSmarts(pat) for pat in ewgs]
      for pattern in ewg_patterns:
          if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern):
              return -1
      return 0
  ```
  
- **Suggestion 8**: **Revise Rule 10 Code to Include More Nitrogen-Containing Aromatic Side Chains**

  **Issue**: The current code for Rule 10 only looks for indole rings, missing other nitrogen-containing aromatic systems like imidazole.

  **Improvement**: Extend the `rule10` function to include other relevant heterocycles such as imidazole and pyrrole that can coordinate with metal centers.

  **Revised Code**:
  ```python
  def rule10(mol):
      # Detect amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains
      heterocycle_patterns = [
          Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1c[cH]c[nH]1'),  # Indole
          Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cnccn1'),       # Pyrimidine
          Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1c[nH]cn1')      # Imidazole
      ]
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(carboxylic_acid_pattern) and mol.HasSubstructMatch(primary_amine_pattern):
          for pattern in heterocycle_patterns:
              if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern):
                  return 1
      return 0
  ```
  
- **Suggestion 9**: **Update Rule 12 Code to More Accurately Identify Aromatic Chelating Systems**

  **Issue**: The current code for Rule 12 may not capture all aromatic systems capable of chelation due to overly simplistic patterns.

  **Improvement**: Modify the `rule12` function to look for ortho-dihydroxy or ortho-hydroxycarbonyl functionalities on aromatic rings, which can chelate metal centers.

  **Revised Code**:
  ```python
  def rule12(mol):
      # Identify aromatic systems with adjacent donor groups (e.g., catechol)
      chelate_patterns = [
          Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([OX2H])cc([OX2H])c1'),     # Catechol
          Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([OX2H])c([C](=O)[OX1H])c1')  # Salicylaldehyde
      ]
      for pattern in chelate_patterns:
          if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern):
              return 1
      return 0
  ```
  
- **Suggestion 10**: **Improve Rule 13 Code to Detect Bulky Substituents Near Coordination Sites**

  **Issue**: The current code for Rule 13 may not effectively identify bulky groups near coordination sites because it only looks for primary amines attached to aromatic rings.

  **Improvement**: Enhance the `rule13` function to check for any bulky groups (e.g., phenyl rings, tert-butyl groups) near functional groups that could coordinate with metals, by examining the neighboring atoms.

  **Revised Code**:
  ```python
  def rule13(mol):
      # Identify bulky substituents near potential coordination sites
      coordination_atoms = [atom.GetIdx() for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.GetAtomicNum() in [7, 8, 16]]  # N, O, S
      for idx in coordination_atoms:
          atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(idx)
          for neighbor in atom.GetNeighbors():
              if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 6 and neighbor.IsAromatic():
                  # Check if aromatic carbon is part of a bulky group
                  if len(neighbor.GetNeighbors()) > 2:
                      return -1
      return 0
  ```
  
- **Suggestion 11**: **General Recommendation to Validate SMARTS Patterns Against Known Examples**

  **Issue**: Some of the SMARTS patterns used may be too general or too specific, leading to incorrect matches.

  **Improvement**: For each rule, validate the SMARTS patterns and the code against known example compounds (both positive and negative) to ensure accurate functionality. This involves testing the code with the specific SMILES of the examples and counterexamples provided in the rules.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Include Error Handling and Logging for Debugging**

  **Issue**: The current code does not log which compounds match which rules, making debugging difficult.

  **Improvement**: Modify the code to include logging statements that record when a rule is matched and which compounds are affected. This will help in verifying the correctness of the transformation process.

  **Example Code Modification**:
  ```python
  import logging
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
  
  # Inside each rule function, add logging when a match is found
  def ruleX(mol):
      if condition:
          logging.info(f"Rule X matched for molecule {mol.GetProp('_Name')}")
          return prediction
      return 0
  ```

  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**; Low Yield—possible steric hindrance or reduced availability of nitrogen for coordination)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description usually result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Sulfhydryl Groups on Short Chains Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing a sulfhydryl group (**–SH**) near the carboxyl group on a short aliphatic chain.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal ions due to the polarizability of sulfur's electron pair.

- **Example**:

  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers Containing Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers with amide linkages (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group or within the main chain.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups may delocalize electron density through resonance, reducing the availability of the nitrogen or oxygen atoms for effective metal coordination.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Flexible Polyether Chains Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing internal ether linkages (**–O–**) within flexible aliphatic chains, such as polyethylene glycol derivatives.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Increased flexibility can reduce effective coordination due to entropic effects, and ether oxygens may not coordinate strongly with metal centers.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen in heterocycles offers coordination sites, enhancing catalyst interaction.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**; Low Yield—no coordinating nitrogen in side chain)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Ketone Groups on Aliphatic Chains Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers having carbonyl groups (**–C=O**) such as aldehydes or ketones on aliphatic chains adjacent to carboxyl groups.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Carbonyl groups can engage in competing interactions and may sequester metal ions through undesired coordination, reducing catalyst activity.

- **Example**:
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Compound **27**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Aromatic Systems Capable of Chelation Lead to High Yield**

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Bulky Substituents Near Coordination Sites Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that have large, bulky groups near potential coordination sites, which can hinder effective interaction with the metal center due to steric hindrance.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Steric hindrance prevents optimal alignment and binding of the modifier to the catalyst, reducing catalytic activity.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)

These rules provide a structured approach to predict whether a molecular modifier will lead to a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By focusing on combinations of sub-structures and functional groups, and considering the underlying physico-chemical properties, the rules help in selecting appropriate modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.

**Coverage and Balance**:

- **Broad Coverage**: The rules encompass modifiers with amino acids, aromatic compounds, aliphatic chains, heterocycles, and various functional groups.

- **Simplicity and Complexity**: The set includes simple rules with broad coverage (e.g., Rule 1 on amino and carboxylic acids on short chains) and more complex rules with narrower focus (e.g., Rule 12 on aromatic systems capable of chelation).

- **Predictive Power**: Each rule provides clear criteria for predicting high or low yield, aiding in decision-making for catalyst modification.

By applying these rules, chemists can make informed choices in the design and selection of molecular modifiers to enhance the yield of the target reaction, contributing to the success of the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1**. The current pattern for Rule 1 is `primary_amine + '(' + short_aliphatic_chain + '{1,4})' + carboxylic_acid`, which translates to `[NX3;H2]([CH2]{1,4})[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`. This pattern may not accurately capture modifiers with both amino and carboxylic acid groups on short aliphatic chains because it assumes the amino group is directly connected to the aliphatic chain, which then connects to the carboxylic acid. To reflect the correct structure, revise the pattern to ensure that the amino group and the carboxylic acid are both attached to the same aliphatic chain of 2 to 5 carbons. Consider using a pattern like `[*][CH2]{0,3}[CH](N)[CH2][CH2][C](=O)[O,OH]` to represent a chain where the amino and carboxylic acid groups are separated by 2 to 5 carbons.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Explicitly define connectivity and chain lengths in SMARTS patterns**. In Rule 1, instead of using `([CH2]{1,4})`, specify the entire backbone chain with defined length, such as `[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]` for a 4-carbon chain. Use appropriate wildcard atoms and bonding to connect functional groups accurately. This ensures the SMARTS pattern matches molecules where both functional groups are appropriately positioned on the chain.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Revise the SMARTS pattern for Rule 2 to specify the para-substitution accurately**. The current pattern `c1cc([cX3;H0,NX3,O;H1])ccc1` may not effectively identify para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with metal-coordinating groups. Modify the pattern to `c1cc([*])ccc1C(=O)O`, where `[*]` represents a substituent at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. Then, ensure that this substituent is a group capable of metal coordination by adding an additional check for coordinating groups, such as `[$(N),$(O)]`.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Ensure functional group definitions are precise**. For example, redefine `hydroxyl_group` as `[OX2H][#6]` to specify that the hydroxyl group is attached to a carbon atom. Similarly, review other functional group SMARTS definitions to include any necessary context or connectivity to improve pattern matching accuracy.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Adjust the pattern for Rule 3 to correctly identify multiple hydroxyl groups near carboxylic acids**. The pattern `(' + hydroxyl_group + '){2,}.*' + carboxylic_acid` may not ensure that the hydroxyl groups are near the carboxylic acid. Refine the pattern to require hydroxyl groups within a certain number of bonds from the carboxylic acid, using SMARTS like `[$([OX2H][#6])][$([#6][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])]`.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Improve the pattern for Rule 4 to capture heterocyclic nitrogen atoms capable of coordination**. Currently, the pattern `pyridine_ring + '.*' + carboxylic_acid` may miss other heterocycles like pyrazole. Broaden the pattern to include other nitrogen-containing rings using SMARTS such as `[$(n1cccc1),$(n1nccc1),$(c1ncccc1)]` and ensure they are connected to carboxylic acid groups.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Modify Rule 6 to exclude molecules with additional polar functional groups effectively**. The current exclude patterns `[hydroxyl_group, amino_group, ether_linkage]` may not account for all polar groups. Expand the list to include other polar functionalities like `carbonyl groups`, `halogens`, and ensure the exclude logic correctly prevents molecules with any of these groups from matching the rule.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Clarify and correct the pattern for Rule 7 regarding electron-withdrawing groups**. The current pattern may not accurately capture electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to carboxylic acids. Use SMARTS that specifically target such substituents directly attached to the alpha carbon of the carboxylic acid, for example, using `[$([CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])]` to find ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Enhance the pattern for Rule 9 to match flexible polyether chains accurately**. Adjust the pattern to `(' + ether_linkage + '){2,}.*' + carboxylic_acid` but ensure that the ether linkages form a chain by specifying connectivity, such as `[#6][OX2][#6][OX2][#6][OX2][#6][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` to represent a polyethylene glycol chain terminating with a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Test and validate SMARTS patterns against known examples and counterexamples**. Before applying the patterns to the entire SMILES list, individually test them on the compounds provided in the rules as examples and counterexamples. This will help identify mismatches and refine the patterns to ensure they align with the intended chemical structures described in the rules.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers Containing Both Amino and Carboxylic Acid Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains (2 to 5 Carbons) Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that feature both an amino group (**–NH₂**) and at least one carboxyl group (**–COOH**) on a straight-chain aliphatic backbone consisting of 2 to 5 carbon atoms.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The presence of amino and carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing the formation of stable complexes with the catalyst. Short chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating effective interaction with the metal center.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (L-Glutamic acid, Compound **0**)
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (L-Aspartic acid, Compound **2**)
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Compound **3**)

- **Counterexamples**:
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Compound **31**; Low Yield—longer chain increases flexibility and reduces coordination efficiency)
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**; Low Yield—chain length exceeds optimal range)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituents Capable of Metal Coordination Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with functional groups at the para position that can act as Lewis bases or coordinate with metal centers—such as amino (**–NH₂**), hydroxy (**–OH**), or pyridyl groups.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Para-substituents enhance electron density and provide additional coordination sites, improving interaction with the metal center.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Compound **4**)
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Compound **24**)
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Compound **7**)

- **Counterexamples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**; Low Yield—the aldehyde group is electron-withdrawing)
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Compound **21**; Exception—though nitro is electron-withdrawing, this compound gives high yield)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description generally result in **high yield**.

---

- **Description**: Modifiers containing several hydroxyl groups (**–OH**) in close proximity to carboxyl groups, either on aliphatic chains or cyclic structures, forming polyol systems.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal ions effectively, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Compound **9**)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Compound **6**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers with Heterocyclic Nitrogen Atoms Capable of Metal Coordination Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that include nitrogen-containing heterocycles where the nitrogen atom is available for coordination with metal centers, such as pyridine or pyrazole rings.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate with metal ions, enhancing complex stability.

- **Examples**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Compound **22**)
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **16**)
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Compound **8**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Compound **12**; Low Yield—possible steric hindrance or reduced availability of nitrogen for coordination)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description usually result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Sulfhydryl Groups on Short Chains Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing a sulfhydryl group (**–SH**) near the carboxyl group on a short aliphatic chain.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal ions due to the polarizability of sulfur's electron pair.

- **Example**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Compound **18**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Compound **10**; Low Yield—the aromatic ring may diminish sulfur's coordinating ability)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Long Aliphatic Chains Without Additional Polar Functional Groups Result in High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and no other functional groups besides the terminal carboxyl group.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: These modifiers may improve interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or facilitate better substrate accessibility.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid** (Compound **5**)

- **Counterexamples**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Compound **29**; Low Yield—additional hydroxyl group alters properties)
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Compound **34**; Low Yield—additional amino group may introduce undesired interactions)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers featuring electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., aldehyde, keto, fluorinated groups) adjacent to the carboxyl group or on the aromatic ring.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density at coordination sites, weakening interaction with metal centers.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Compound **20**)
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Compound **19**)
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Compound **14**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers Containing Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Groups Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers with amide linkages (**–CONH–**) near the carboxyl group or within the main chain.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Amide groups may delocalize electron density through resonance, reducing the availability of the nitrogen or oxygen atoms for effective metal coordination.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Compound **26**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Flexible Polyether Chains Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing internal ether linkages (**–O–**) within flexible aliphatic chains, such as polyethylene glycol derivatives.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Increased flexibility can reduce effective coordination due to entropic effects, and ether oxygens may not coordinate strongly with metal centers.

- **Example**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Compound **11**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Nitrogen-Containing Aromatic Side Chains Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Amino acids with aromatic side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles capable of metal coordination.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen in heterocycles offers coordination sites, enhancing catalyst interaction.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-Tryptophan, Compound **15**)

- **Counterexample**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**; Low Yield—no coordinating nitrogen in side chain)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Ketone Groups on Aliphatic Chains Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers having carbonyl groups (**–C=O**) such as aldehydes or ketones on aliphatic chains adjacent to carboxyl groups.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Carbonyl groups can engage in competing interactions and may sequester metal ions through undesired coordination, reducing catalyst activity.

- **Example**:
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Compound **27**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Aromatic Systems Capable of Chelation Lead to High Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing aromatic systems with adjacent donor groups (e.g., hydroxyl and carbonyl) capable of chelating metal centers.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Chelation enhances the stability of metal complexes and improves catalytic efficiency.

- **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Compound **17**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **high yield**.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Bulky Substituents Near Coordination Sites Lead to Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that have large, bulky groups near potential coordination sites, which can hinder effective interaction with the metal center due to steric hindrance.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: Steric hindrance prevents optimal alignment and binding of the modifier to the catalyst, reducing catalytic activity.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-Phenylalanine, Compound **13**)
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Compound **33**)

- **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will result in **low yield**.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules provide a structured approach to predict whether a molecular modifier will lead to a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By focusing on combinations of sub-structures and functional groups, and considering the underlying physico-chemical properties, the rules help in selecting appropriate modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.

**Coverage and Balance**:

- **Broad Coverage**: The rules encompass modifiers with amino acids, aromatic compounds, aliphatic chains, heterocycles, and various functional groups.

- **Simplicity and Complexity**: The set includes simple rules with broad coverage (e.g., Rule 1 on amino and carboxylic acids on short chains) and more complex rules with narrower focus (e.g., Rule 12 on aromatic systems capable of chelation).

- **Predictive Power**: Each rule provides clear criteria for predicting high or low yield, aiding in decision-making for catalyst modification.

By applying these rules, chemists can make informed choices in the design and selection of molecular modifiers to enhance the yield of the target reaction, contributing to the success of the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: *Revise Rule 1's SMARTS Pattern*: The current SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 (`'[NX3;H2][CH2]{1,4}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`) is too restrictive and fails to match compounds like L-Glutamic acid and L-Aspartic acid, where the amino group is attached directly to the alpha carbon next to the carboxyl group. Modify the pattern to include alpha-amino acids by allowing the amino group to be connected directly to a carbon that is adjacent to the carboxylic acid group. A revised pattern could be:
  ```
  '[NX3;H2][$([CH]([CH2]){0,3}[CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]),$([CH][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])]'
  ```
  This pattern accounts for an amino group connected to a chain (including the alpha carbon) with 2 to 5 carbons total.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: *Expand Rule 2's SMARTS Pattern*: The pattern for Rule 2 (`'c1cc([$(N),$(O)])ccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`) only matches modifiers where the coordinating substituent is directly attached to the benzene ring in the para position relative to the carboxyl group. It misses compounds like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, where there's an aliphatic chain between the ring and the carboxyl group. Modify the pattern to allow for an aliphatic linker between the aromatic ring and the carboxylic acid:
  ```
  'c1ccc(cc1)[CX4][CH2]{0,3}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```
  Additionally, ensure the para-substituent capable of metal coordination is present:
  ```
  'c1cc([NX3H2,OX2H])ccc1[CX4][CH2]{0,3}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```

- ** Suggestion 3 **: *Refine Rule 3's Hydroxyl Group Matching*: The current pattern for Rule 3 (`'[OX2H]'` with `min_count` of 2) is too general and may match any compound with two hydroxyl groups anywhere in the molecule. Refine the pattern to ensure that the multiple hydroxyl groups are near the carboxylic acid group. A possible pattern is:
  ```
  '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2][CH](O)[CH](O)[#6]'
  ```
  Or more generally, ensure that there are multiple hydroxyl groups within two bonds of the carboxylic acid:
  ```
  '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2][CH](O)[CH2][OH]'
  ```
  Adjust the `min_count` to reflect the required number of hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: *Broaden Rule 4's Heterocyclic Nitrogen Patterns*: The current pattern for Rule 4 (`'[$(n1ccccc1),$(n1ncccc1),$(c1ncccc1)][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`) may miss other relevant heterocycles. Broaden the pattern to include other nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyrazoles, pyridazines, and imidazoles. A possible pattern is:
  ```
  '[n][c]1cccc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```
  Or more generally:
  ```
  '[nH0;!$(n[a])]1cccc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```
  This ensures that nitrogen atoms in various heterocycles are considered.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: *Adjust Exclude Patterns in Rule 6*: In Rule 6, the exclude patterns include `[#6]=[O]` and `[#6]#[N]`, which inadvertently exclude carboxylic acids and nitriles, potentially missing valid compounds. Modify the exclude patterns to avoid this issue. Exclude specific functional groups like hydroxyl (`[OX2H]`), amino (`[NX3;H2,H1]`), ethers (`[#6][OX2][#6]`), and halogens (`[F,Cl,Br,I]`), but allow carbonyl groups that are part of the carboxylic acid:
  ```
  'exclude_patterns': ['[OX2H]', '[NX3;H2,H1]', '[#6][OX2][#6]', '[F,Cl,Br,I]', '[#6]=[!OX1H0-,OX2H1]', '[#6]#[N]']
  ```
  This adjustment ensures carboxylic acids are included while undesired polar groups are excluded.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: *Improve Rule 7's Patterns for Electron-Withdrawing Groups*: Ensure that the patterns for Rule 7 accurately capture modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid. The patterns should include aldehydes, ketones, and fluorinated groups near the carboxyl group. Add patterns for other electron-withdrawing groups mentioned in the rule:
  ```
  'patterns': [
      '[CX3](=O)[CX3H1](=O)',  # Adjacent aldehyde
      '[CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)',    # Adjacent ketone
      '[CX3](=O)[C;R0](F)(F)F',  # Adjacent trifluoromethyl group
      '[CX3](=O)c1ccc(C=O)cc1'  # Aromatic ring with aldehyde
  ]
  ```
  This ensures all relevant electron-withdrawing groups are considered.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: *Include Compound Identifiers in the Analysis*: To improve traceability and verification, include the compound numbers or names associated with each SMILES in the dataset. This will help in mapping the feature matrix results back to the corresponding compounds mentioned in the rules and ensure accurate validation.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: *Implement Detailed Logging and Testing*: Incorporate logging statements within the code to output which compounds match each rule during execution. Additionally, write unit tests for each rule to verify that the SMARTS patterns match the expected compounds and not the unintended ones. This will facilitate debugging and ensure the rules are correctly implemented.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: *Review and Update All SMARTS Patterns*: Go through each rule and cross-check the SMARTS patterns against the natural language descriptions to ensure they accurately represent the intended chemical substructures. Engage with a cheminformatics expert if necessary to fine-tune the patterns.

**Comments on the Performance of the Current Rules Based on the Current Metrics**

After carefully analyzing the current rule metrics in comparison with the reference metrics from previous iterations, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current rules, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**.

---

**1. Comparison of Current Metrics to Reference Metrics**

**a. Train Support**

- **Previous Mean Train Support**: 
  - Average of previous values: (0.1667 + 0.1845) / 2 = **0.1756**.
- **Current Train Support**: **0.0242**.
- **Observation**: The current train support is significantly lower than the previous mean. This indicates that the current rules cover a much smaller portion of the training data. While specialized rules can be valuable, extremely low support may limit the practical applicability of the rules.

**b. Train Confidence**

- **Previous Mean Train Confidence**:
  - Average of previous values: (0.6352 + 0.5396) / 2 = **0.5874**.
- **Current Train Confidence**: **0.5615**.
- **Observation**: The current train confidence is slightly lower than the previous mean. Confidence measures the proportion of instances where the rule prediction is correct out of all instances where the rule conditions are met. A decrease suggests that the predictive reliability of the rules has slightly diminished.

**c. Train Lift**

- **Previous Mean Train Lift**:
  - Average of previous values: (1.2048 + 1.0559) / 2 = **1.1304**.
- **Current Train Lift**: **1.1132**.
- **Observation**: The current train lift is marginally lower than the previous mean. Lift indicates the strength of the rule in comparison to random chance. A lift greater than 1 suggests that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than guessing. The slight decrease implies a minor reduction in the effectiveness of the rules.

**d. Train Leverage**

- **Previous Mean Train Leverage**:
  - Average of previous values: (0.0289 + (-0.0041)) / 2 = **0.0124**.
- **Current Train Leverage**: **0.0050**.
- **Observation**: The current train leverage is lower than the previous mean. Positive leverage values indicate that there is a stronger association than would be expected by chance. A decrease suggests that the rules are contributing less additional information over random chance.

---

**2. Insights from Metric Comparison**

- **Decrease in Support**: The substantial drop in train support suggests that the current rules are more specific and apply to fewer cases. While specificity can increase confidence and lift, in this case, confidence and lift have not improved proportionally.
- **Slight Decrease in Confidence and Lift**: The minor declines in both confidence and lift indicate that the predictive power of the rules has not improved and may have slightly worsened.
- **Leverage Reduction**: The reduction in leverage supports the observation that the current rules are offering less advantage over random chance compared to previous iterations.

---

**3. Potential Reasons for Metric Changes**

- **Over-Specialization**: The current rules may be too narrow, capturing specific instances that do not generalize well across the dataset.
- **Rule Complexity**: Introducing more complex rules without sufficient data support can lead to lower overall performance.
- **Data Variability**: There may be inherent variability in the data that is not being adequately captured by the current rules.

---

**4. Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- The metrics indicate that the current set of rules might have reached a point where further iterations using the same approach yield diminishing returns.
- The decrease in performance metrics suggests the possibility of a local minimum, where the optimization process is stuck in a suboptimal solution.
- Continuing iterations without changing the strategy may not lead to significant improvements.

---

**Suggestions for Improving the Current Rules**

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made to enhance the performance of the rules:

**a. Increase Rule Generality to Improve Support**

- **Broaden Rule Conditions**: Relax overly strict conditions in the rules to make them applicable to a larger portion of the dataset.
- **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge rules that are similar or overlap in their conditions to create more general rules with higher support.

**b. Enhance Confidence and Lift**

- **Focus on High-Performing Subsets**: Identify subsets of data where rules perform exceptionally well and analyze the characteristics that contribute to higher confidence and lift.
- **Eliminate Low-Performing Rules**: Remove or revise rules that have low confidence and lift to prevent them from lowering the overall performance.

**c. Refine Rule Conditions Using Domain Knowledge**

- **Leverage Chemical Insights**: Incorporate deeper chemical understanding to refine rule conditions, ensuring they are based on sound scientific principles that are likely to hold across more instances.
- **Identify Key Features**: Determine which molecular features most significantly contribute to high yields and prioritize these in rule development.

**d. Balance Between Specificity and Generality**

- **Optimize Rule Complexity**: Aim for rules that are neither too specific (low support) nor too general (low confidence). Finding the right balance can improve overall performance.
- **Use Threshold Adjustments**: Adjust thresholds for support and confidence in the rule induction algorithm to find an optimal set of rules.

**e. Incorporate More Data**

- **Expand the Dataset**: If possible, include more compounds in the training data to provide a richer dataset for rule generation.
- **Augment with External Data**: Use data from similar reactions or related studies to enhance the learning process.

**f. Cross-Validation and Testing**

- **Perform Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the generalizability of the rules and prevent overfitting to the training data.
- **Evaluate on Test Data**: Compare performance metrics on test datasets to ensure that improvements in training metrics translate to unseen data.

**g. Algorithmic Enhancements**

- **Explore Alternative Algorithms**: Consider using different rule induction algorithms or ensemble methods that might capture patterns more effectively.
- **Tune Hyperparameters**: Adjust hyperparameters within the current algorithm to optimize performance. This might include changing the minimum support or confidence levels required for rule generation.

**h. Analyze Exceptions and Outliers**

- **Investigate Counterexamples**: Examine cases where the rules fail to predict correctly to understand limitations and improve rule conditions.
- **Address Data Anomalies**: Identify and address any anomalies or errors in the data that could be negatively impacting rule performance.

**i. Continuous Iterative Improvement**

- **Integrate Feedback Loops**: Establish a process where insights from each iteration inform the next, allowing for continuous refinement of rules.
- **Monitor Metric Trends**: Keep track of how metrics change over iterations to identify patterns and make informed decisions about when to stop or adjust the process.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules, while potentially valuable, shows reduced performance in key metrics compared to previous iterations. The significant decrease in support, along with slight declines in confidence and lift, suggests that the rules have become too specialized without corresponding gains in predictive accuracy.

To improve the rules:

- **Increase support** by generalizing rules where appropriate.
- **Enhance confidence and lift** by refining rule conditions using domain expertise.
- **Adjust the balance** between specificity and generality to optimize performance.
- **Incorporate additional data and validation techniques** to ensure that the rules are robust and generalizable.

By implementing these suggestions and embracing an iterative approach that incorporates feedback and continuous learning, the performance of the rules can be improved, leading to more reliable predictions and contributing positively to the research program's objectives.

---

**Note**: It's important to collaborate with domain experts, such as chemists involved in the research program, to ensure that any changes to the rules are scientifically sound and align with practical understanding of the catalytic processes under study.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules Based on Latest Training Results**

**1. Evaluation of Effectiveness:**

The current classification model achieved an accuracy of **62.86%** in the 5-fold cross-validation. This is consistent with some previous iterations but lower than the highest accuracy of **76%** observed earlier. The moderate accuracy indicates that while the rules capture some patterns in the data, there is room for improvement to enhance predictive performance.

**2. Assessing Overfitting/Underfitting:**

The variation in accuracies across iterations suggests issues with model fitting:

- **Underfitting:** The model may be too simplistic, failing to capture the underlying complexity of the data due to inadequate or overly generalized rules.
- **Overfitting:** Some rules might be tailored too closely to specific training examples, not generalizing well to unseen data.

Given the moderate and inconsistent accuracies, the model potentially suffers from both underfitting and overfitting in different areas.

**3. Analyzing Discrepancies via SHAP Values:**

**Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

- **Molecule:** **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
  - **Rule2 SHAP value:** **-0.0216**
  - **Rule10 SHAP value:** **-0.0693**

- **Molecule:** **C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)** (Gluconic acid)
  - **Rule2 SHAP value:** **-0.0216**
  - **Rule10 SHAP value:** **-0.0693**

- **Observation:** Negative SHAP values from **Rule2** and **Rule10** contribute to underestimating the loading, suggesting that these rules might be incorrectly penalizing certain features.

**Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

- **Molecule:** **C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)O**
  - **Rule2 SHAP value:** **-0.0196**
  - **Rule10 SHAP value:** **0.5196**

- **Molecule:** **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N**
  - **Rule2 SHAP value:** **0.5250**
  - **Rule10 SHAP value:** **-0.0250**

- **Observation:** High positive SHAP values from **Rule2** (and in one case **Rule10**) contribute to overestimations, indicating these rules may be overemphasizing certain molecular features leading to incorrect high predictions.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

The current accuracy does not show an improvement over the baseline and suggests that the existing rules may have reached a local minimum in terms of refining the model's predictive ability. The oscillation in accuracies across iterations indicates that refinements to the rules have not consistently enhanced the model, highlighting the necessity for a strategic revision of the rules.

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- **Rule2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituents Capable of Metal Coordination Lead to High Yield):**

  - **Issue:** Rule2 shows significant positive SHAP values in overestimations and negative SHAP values in underestimations.
  - **Interpretation:** The rule might be too general, misclassifying compounds that do not truly align with its criteria.

- **Rule10 (Modifiers with Nitrogen-Containing Aromatic Side Chains Lead to High Yield):**

  - **Issue:** Rule10 contributes to both overestimations and underestimations, as indicated by its SHAP values.
  - **Interpretation:** The rule may not differentiate adequately between different types of nitrogen heterocycles, leading to incorrect predictions.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rule2:**

- **Current Issue:** Rule2 is too broad, leading to misclassification of compounds that possess para-substituents but do not result in high yield.

- **Suggested Refinements:**

  - **Specify Effective Substituents:** Limit the rule to specific para-substituents known to enhance yield, such as amino (**–NH₂**) and hydroxy (**–OH**) groups, which are strong electron donors and effective in metal coordination.
  - **Exclude Electron-Withdrawing Groups:** Modify the rule to exclude para-substituents that are electron-withdrawing or do not contribute positively to metal coordination (e.g., nitro, aldehyde groups).

- **Revised Rule2:**

  - **Description:** Aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents that are strong electron-donating groups (e.g., **–NH₂**, **–OH**) capable of effective metal coordination lead to high yield.
  - **Examples:** 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid.
  - **Counterexamples:** 4-nitrobenzoic acid should be excluded despite previous exceptions, as it contributes to misclassification.

**2. Adjust Rule10:**

- **Current Issue:** Rule10's broad classification includes all nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains, not accounting for the varying coordination abilities of different heterocycles.

- **Suggested Refinements:**

  - **Differentiate Heterocycles:** Specify which nitrogen-containing heterocycles are effective in metal coordination (e.g., pyridine) and exclude those that are less effective due to steric hindrance or resonance stabilization (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan).

- **Revised Rule10:**

  - **Description:** Modifiers with nitrogen-containing aromatic rings where the nitrogen is a pyridinic nitrogen (in pyridine-like rings) that is readily available for metal coordination lead to high yield.
  - **Examples:** Nicotinic acid (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid).
  - **Counterexamples:** Compounds with indole or pyrrole rings (e.g., tryptophan) should be excluded as the nitrogen is less available for coordination.

**3. Improve Generalization:**

- **Simplify Overly Complex Rules:** Ensure rules are not overly specific to particular compounds unless strongly justified by chemical reasoning.

- **Balance Rule Coverage:** Adjust rules to achieve better coverage of compounds without sacrificing specificity, preventing both overfitting and underfitting.

**4. Incorporate SHAP Insights:**

- **Focus on Rules with High Impact:** Prioritize refining rules that consistently show high SHAP values in misclassifications (e.g., Rule2, Rule10).

- **Positive SHAP Values in Overestimations:**

  - **Action:** Tighten the criteria of the rule to reduce false positives.

- **Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations:**

  - **Action:** Broaden the rule or adjust its criteria to include missed features leading to false negatives.

**5. Re-evaluate Rules with Contradictory Examples:**

- **Example:** 4-nitrobenzoic acid was previously considered an exception having a high yield despite an electron-withdrawing nitro group.

- **Action:** Reconsider whether such exceptions should modify the rule or highlight the need for a new rule acknowledging the unique behavior of certain functional groups.

**6. Additional Data Analysis:**

- **Examine Misclassified Molecules:** Analyze molecules that are consistently misclassified to identify any unaccounted structural features.

- **Identify New Patterns:** Use SHAP analysis to discover relationships not captured by current rules, potentially leading to new rule formulation.

**7. Iterative Testing and Validation:**

- **After Adjustments:** Reassess the model's performance with the refined rules to determine if accuracy improves.

- **Continuous Refinement:** Use each iteration to fine-tune the rules further, ensuring they are backed by chemical rationale and empirical evidence.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules effectively captures some of the underlying chemistry but lacks the precision needed for higher predictive accuracy. By refining **Rule2** and **Rule10** based on SHAP analysis and chemical insights, we can enhance the model's performance. It's crucial to strike a balance between generality and specificity in rule definitions, ensuring they are neither too broad (leading to overfitting) nor too narrow (resulting in underfitting). Continuous, data-driven refinement of the rules will lead to a more robust predictive model aligned with experimental observations.

---

**Note:** The revised rules should be re-implemented in the model, and the resulting SHAP values and accuracy metrics should be analyzed in subsequent iterations to validate the effectiveness of the changes. This iterative process will help in converging towards a set of rules that generalize well and improve the model's predictive capability.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current set of rules aimed at predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has undergone several iterations. However, the performance metrics indicate that the current rules are not achieving the desired level of predictive accuracy. Specifically, the following issues have been identified:

1. **Low Support and Confidence:** The train support of the current rules is significantly lower than previous iterations (from approximately 17.5% to 2.4%), indicating that the rules cover a smaller portion of the data. The train confidence has also decreased slightly, suggesting reduced reliability in predictions.

2. **Moderate Accuracy:** The classification model's accuracy hovers around 62.86%, which, while consistent with some prior results, is lower than the highest observed accuracy of 76%. This suggests that the model is not effectively capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

3. **SHAP Analysis Insights:** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values highlight that certain rules are contributing to misclassifications:
   - **Rule 2** (Aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of metal coordination) shows both positive and negative SHAP values leading to overestimations and underestimations, indicating that the rule may be too broad or misapplied.
   - **Rule 10** (Modifiers with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains) also contributes to misclassifications, suggesting that differentiation among nitrogen-containing heterocycles is needed.

4. **Potential Overfitting and Underfitting:** The inconsistencies in accuracies and performance metrics imply that some rules may be too generalized (underfitting), while others are too specific (overfitting), leading to poor generalization on unseen data.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

To address the issues identified, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Revise Rule 1's SMARTS Pattern:**
   - **Issue:** The current SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 does not adequately capture alpha-amino acids like L-Glutamic and L-Aspartic acid.
   - **Suggestion:** Modify the pattern to include amino groups attached directly to the alpha carbon next to the carboxyl group.
     - **Revised Pattern:**
       ```
       '[NX3;H2][$([CH]([CH2]){0,3}[CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]),$([CH][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])]'
       ```
   - **Expected Outcome:** Improved matching of compounds that fit Rule 1, increasing support and confidence.

2. **Expand Rule 2's SMARTS Pattern:**
   - **Issue:** The current pattern is too restrictive and misses compounds with aliphatic linkers between the aromatic ring and the carboxylic acid.
   - **Suggestion:** Modify the pattern to allow for an aliphatic linker and ensure the presence of para-substituents capable of metal coordination.
     - **Revised Pattern:**
       ```
       'c1cc([NX3H2,OX2H])ccc1[CX4][CH2]{0,3}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
       ```
   - **Expected Outcome:** Better coverage of relevant compounds, reducing misclassifications due to the rule's over-specificity.

3. **Refine Rule 3's Hydroxyl Group Matching:**
   - **Issue:** The existing pattern is too general, possibly matching any compound with two hydroxyl groups.
   - **Suggestion:** Focus the pattern on compounds where multiple hydroxyl groups are near the carboxylic acid group.
     - **Revised Pattern:**
       ```
       '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2][CH](O)[CH](O)[#6]'
       ```
   - **Expected Outcome:** Improved specificity in matching compounds that truly fit the criteria of Rule 3, enhancing confidence.

4. **Broaden Rule 4's Heterocyclic Nitrogen Patterns:**
   - **Issue:** The pattern may miss relevant nitrogen-containing heterocycles.
   - **Suggestion:** Include additional heterocycles, such as pyrazoles, pyridazines, and imidazoles.
     - **Revised Pattern:**
       ```
       '[n][c]1cccc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
       ```
   - **Expected Outcome:** Increased support by capturing a broader range of compounds that align with Rule 4.

5. **Adjust Exclude Patterns in Rule 6:**
   - **Issue:** Current exclude patterns inadvertently exclude carboxylic acids and nitriles.
   - **Suggestion:** Modify exclude patterns to prevent the exclusion of carboxylic acids while still excluding undesired groups.
     - **Revised Exclude Patterns:**
       ```
       'exclude_patterns': ['[OX2H]', '[NX3;H2,H1]', '[#6][OX2][#6]', '[F,Cl,Br,I]', '[#6]=[!OX1H0-,OX2H1]', '[#6]#[N]']
       ```
   - **Expected Outcome:** Inclusion of relevant compounds in Rule 6, improving support and preventing unintended exclusions.

6. **Improve Rule 7's Patterns for Electron-Withdrawing Groups:**
   - **Issue:** Patterns may not capture all electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid.
   - **Suggestion:** Add patterns for additional electron-withdrawing groups mentioned.
     - **Revised Patterns:**
       ```
       'patterns': [
           '[CX3](=O)[CX3H1](=O)',         # Adjacent aldehyde
           '[CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)',           # Adjacent ketone
           '[CX3](=O)[C;R0](F)(F)F',       # Adjacent trifluoromethyl group
           '[CX3](=O)c1ccc(C=O)cc1'        # Aromatic ring with aldehyde
       ]
       ```
   - **Expected Outcome:** More accurate identification of compounds that should be classified under Rule 7, enhancing prediction accuracy.

7. **Review and Update All SMARTS Patterns:**
   - **Issue:** Potential misalignment between rules' descriptions and their SMARTS patterns.
   - **Suggestion:** Cross-verify each SMARTS pattern with the corresponding rule's description and adjust as necessary to ensure accurate representation.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Alignment between the intended chemical substructures and the implemented patterns, leading to better model performance.

8. **Implement Detailed Logging and Testing:**
   - **Issue:** Lack of transparency in which compounds match specific rules.
   - **Suggestion:** Incorporate logging to output compounds matching each rule and develop unit tests to validate SMARTS patterns.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Easier debugging and validation of rules, ensuring they work as intended.

9. **Incorporate SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - **Issue:** Certain rules contribute to misclassifications, as indicated by SHAP values.
   - **Suggestion:** Use SHAP analysis to identify and refine rules that consistently lead to incorrect predictions.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Reduced misclassifications by addressing rules that negatively impact model predictions.

10. **Balance Rule Specificity and Generality:**
    - **Issue:** Rules may be too specific (low support) or too general (low confidence).
    - **Suggestion:** Adjust rule conditions to find an optimal balance, improving both support and confidence.
    - **Expected Outcome:** Enhanced overall performance metrics, leading to a more robust model.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Improved Representation of Chemical Knowledge:** By refining SMARTS patterns and ensuring they align with chemical intuition, the model will better capture the underlying relationships without resorting to overly complex or specific rules.

- **Addressing Underfitting:** Enhancing the rules to cover more relevant compounds will increase support and help the model generalize better, reducing underfitting.

- **Preventing Overfitting:** By avoiding overly specific rules that only apply to a few compounds, the model can maintain generality and avoid overfitting to the training data.

- **Iterative Refinement:** Utilizing SHAP analysis and performance metrics to iteratively refine the rules allows for targeted improvements without excessive complexity.

**Please Optimize Rules**
