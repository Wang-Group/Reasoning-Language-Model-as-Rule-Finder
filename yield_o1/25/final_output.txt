    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are α-amino acids with straight-chain aliphatic side chains of 1 to 4 carbons, possessing both an amino group and a carboxylic acid group on the α-carbon, result in high yield (**True**).
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are α-amino acids with aromatic side chains yield varies based on the specific aromatic group:
  - **High Yield (**True**)**: If the side chain is an indole ring.
    - *Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).
  - **Low Yield (**False**)**: If the side chain is a phenyl ring without additional heteroatoms.
    - *Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine).

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in high yield (**True**).
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-donating groups at the para position result in low yield (**False**), except when the substituent is an amino group, which results in high yield (**True**).
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.
  - *High Yield Exception*: 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with a chain length of 7 to 8 carbons result in high yield (**True**). However, if hydroxyl or amino groups are added to the chain, the yield becomes low (**False**).
  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing thiol (sulfanyl) groups on short aliphatic chains result in high yield (**True**), whereas those with thiol groups on aromatic rings result in low yield (**False**).
  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone resembling sugar structures result in high yield (**True**).
  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid).

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in low yield (**False**).
  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with additional aldehyde or ketone groups result in low yield (**False**).
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms directly attached to the carboxyl group result in high yield (**True**).
  - *Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids linked to another aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain result in yield depending on the linker length:
  - **High Yield (**True**)**: If the linker length is 4 or more carbons.
    - *Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.
  - **Low Yield (**False**)**: If the linker length is 3 or fewer carbons.
    - *Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing ether groups with long polyether chains result in low yield (**False**).
  - *Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with additional amide groups result in low yield (**False**), possibly due to strong coordination with iron centers inhibiting catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*: 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with hydroxyl or amino groups on long aliphatic chains (chain length ≥7 carbons) result in low yield (**False**), while unfunctionalized chains result in high yield (**True**).
  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing electron-rich heterocyclic aromatic rings with adjacent carbonyl groups result in high yield (**True**).
  - *Example*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield (**True**). Introducing hydrophilic functional groups such as hydroxyl or amino groups on long aliphatic chains (more than five carbons) results in low yield (**False**).**
  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a primary amino group on carbon chains of five carbons or fewer result in high yield (**True**). Extending the carbon chain beyond five carbons with amino groups or introducing acylation (amide functionalities) results in low yield (**False**).**
  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid).
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating metal ions (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) result in high yield (**True**). Modifiers with non-coordinating para-substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or significant steric hindrance near the coordinating group result in low yield (**False**).**
  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids linked to another aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield (**True**). Direct linkage or shorter chains between aromatic rings result in low yield (**False**).**
  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield (**True**).**
  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxylated aliphatic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on the backbone result in high yield (**True**).**
  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid), 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone substituents result in low yield (**False**).**
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains result in low yield (**False**).**
  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains containing heterocyclic rings capable of metal coordination result in high yield (**True**). Those with non-coordinating aromatic side chains result in low yield (**False**).**
  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine).

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing long polyether chains or multiple ether linkages result in low yield (**False**).**
  - *Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with thiol groups exhibit yield depending on the position of the thiol group:**
  - **High Yield (**True**)**: Thiol group on aliphatic chains.
    - *Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
  - **Low Yield (**False**)**: Thiol group on aromatic rings.
    - *Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with internal ketone groups or acylated amino groups (amide functionalities) result in low yield (**False**).**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the meta position relative to the carboxyl group result in low yield (**False**).**
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing fused aromatic heterocycles with adjacent carbonyl groups result in high yield (**True**).**
  - *Example*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with significant steric hindrance near coordinating functional groups result in low yield (**False**).**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with an **amino group located within three to five carbons** from the carboxyl group result in **high yield** (**True**). If the amino group is more than five carbons away or absent, the yield is **low** (**False**).**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
  - *Explanation*: The proximity of the amino group allows effective coordination with the metal center of the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. Longer distances reduce this interaction due to increased flexibility and decreased chelation ability.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted group capable of coordinating**, such as **amino**, **nitro**, or **bromomethyl** groups, result in **high yield** (**True**). Para-substituents that are non-coordinating groups, like **methyl** or **formyl**, result in **low yield** (**False**).**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid.
  - *Explanation*: Coordinating groups at the para position enhance interaction with the catalyst's metal center. Non-coordinating substituents do not provide this benefit and may hinder effective coordination.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids** with side chains containing an **additional carboxyl group** (e.g., **aspartic acid**, **glutamic acid**) result in **high yield** (**True**). Amino acids with **hydrophobic side chains** or **bulky groups** result in **low yield** (**False**).**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid).
  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).
  - *Explanation*: Additional carboxyl groups provide extra coordination sites, enhancing catalyst interaction. Hydrophobic or bulky side chains hinder coordination due to steric effects.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups** near the carboxyl group result in **high yield** (**True**).**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid), 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.
  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups offer several coordination sites for the metal catalyst, enhancing binding and reactivity through chelation.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing a **nitrogen atom within the ring**, such as **pyridine** or **pyrazole** derivatives, result in **high yield** (**True**).**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid.
  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in the aromatic ring coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity and improving yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **thiol group within three carbons** from the carboxyl group result in **high yield** (**True**). Thiol groups on **aromatic rings** or further away result in **low yield** (**False**).**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
  - *Explanation*: Proximal thiol groups coordinate effectively with the catalyst. Aromatic or distant thiol groups suffer from steric hindrance or reduced interaction.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl groups** result in **low yield** (**False**).**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.
  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density, weakening the interaction between the modifier and the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with **bulky substituents near coordinating groups** result in **low yield** (**False**).**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.
  - *Explanation*: Bulky groups cause steric hindrance, preventing effective coordination with the catalyst's active site.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with **long polyether chains** or **multiple ether linkages** result in **low yield** (**False**).**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.
  - *Explanation*: Flexible chains may reduce effective binding to the catalyst due to entropic factors and decreased local concentration of coordinating atoms.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-aldehyde or ketone group** result in **low yield** (**False**).**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
  - *Explanation*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can engage in side reactions or disrupt electronic distribution, hindering coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** connected to an **aromatic or heteroaromatic ring via an aliphatic chain** of **four or more carbons** result in **high yield** (**True**). Directly connected rings or shorter chains result in **low yield** (**False**).**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.
  - *Explanation*: Flexible aliphatic chains allow the modifier to adjust for optimal coordination geometry. Rigid structures limit this adaptability.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing **aldehyde or keto groups** in an aliphatic chain or adjacent to coordinating groups result in **low yield** (**False**).**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.
  - *Explanation*: Carbonyl groups can interfere with coordination due to competing interactions or by altering the electronic properties of nearby coordinating atoms.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with **amide groups adjacent to an amino group**, especially if acetylated, result in **low yield** (**False**).**

  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.
  - *Explanation*: Acetylation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination, and adjacent amide groups can withdraw electron density, weakening coordination.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** without additional functional groups and with a chain length of **eight carbons** result in **high yield** (**True**). Shorter or longer chains without functional groups result in **low yield** (**False**).**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: Shorter-chain acids like butanoic acid, longer-chain acids beyond eight carbons.
  - *Explanation*: An eight-carbon chain provides optimal hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface without causing steric hindrance, enhancing yield.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are **fused aromatic carboxylic acids** containing **adjacent carbonyl groups** or **heteroatoms** in the ring system result in **high yield** (**True**).**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.
  - *Explanation*: Fused rings with additional coordinating sites enhance chelation with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving yield.

**End of Rules**

---

**Notes and Justifications:**

- **Correction of Previous Rule 6**: The initial Rule 6 incorrectly stated that modifiers with para-nitro groups result in low yield. Data shows that **4-nitrobenzoic acid** yields are actually high (**True**). The rule has been amended to reflect that para-substituted groups capable of coordination, including nitro groups, result in high yield.

- **Emphasis on Coordination Ability**: The primary factor influencing yield appears to be the modifier's ability to coordinate with the metal center of the catalyst. Functional groups like amino, thiol, hydroxyl, and certain substituents enhance this interaction.

- **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents or rigid structures near coordinating sites negatively impact yield due to steric hindrance, which prevents effective binding to the catalyst.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups can either enhance or hinder coordination depending on their ability to participate directly in metal binding. Groups like nitro can coordinate through oxygen atoms despite being electron-withdrawing.

- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Optimal chain lengths facilitate proper orientation and flexibility for coordination with the catalyst. Chains that are too long, too short, or overly flexible may reduce effective interaction.

- **Hydrogen Bonding and Chelation**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups or heteroatoms contribute to higher yields through enhanced hydrogen bonding or chelation, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex.

- **Application of Rules**: These rules aim to cover a broad range of modifiers while providing specific guidance based on structural features. They balance simplicity and complexity to optimize predictive power across the dataset.

By applying these refined rules, one can predict whether a given modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules consider both the presence of coordinating functional groups and the overall molecular structure, aligning with observed data and underlying chemical principles.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** containing an **amino group** within **three carbons** of the carboxyl group result in a **high yield** (**True**). If the chain is longer without additional coordinating groups, the yield is **low** (**False**). 

   - *High Yield Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
   - *Explanation*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group enhances chelation with the metal center, improving catalyst interaction. Longer chains without proximal coordinating groups diminish this effect due to increased flexibility and reduced chelation efficiency.

2. **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted electron-donating group** (e.g., **amino** or **hydroxy**) result in a **high yield** (**True**). Those with **electron-withdrawing groups** or lacking coordinating substituents result in a **low yield** (**False**).

   - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.
   - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring and coordinating atoms, strengthening interaction with the metal catalyst. Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density, weakening coordination.

3. **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **multiple hydroxyl groups** within **three carbons** of the carboxyl group result in a **high yield** (**True**). Modifiers with distant hydroxyl groups or fewer hydroxyls result in a **low yield** (**False**).

   - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid).
   - *Low Yield Example*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.
   - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group enhance chelation through multiple coordination points, improving metal binding and catalytic activity. Distant or fewer hydroxyl groups offer less enhancement.

4. **Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** with a **nitrogen atom** in the ring, and the **carboxyl group directly attached** to the ring, result in a **high yield** (**True**). Heterocycles without accessible nitrogen for coordination result in a **low yield** (**False**).

   - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Heterocycles where the nitrogen is not positioned for effective coordination.
   - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in the ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance. The position of nitrogen is crucial for effective interaction.

5. **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **thiol group** within **three carbons** of the carboxyl group result in a **high yield** (**True**). Aromatic thiol acids or those with distant thiol groups result in a **low yield** (**False**).

   - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
   - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
   - *Explanation*: Thiol groups near the carboxyl group enhance chelation due to the high affinity of sulfur for metal centers. In aromatic systems, steric and electronic factors may hinder this coordination.

6. **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with an optimal chain length of **eight carbons** and **no additional functional groups** result in a **high yield** (**True**). Shorter or longer chains without coordinating groups result in a **low yield** (**False**).

   - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Hexanoic acid, decanoic acid.
   - *Explanation*: An eight-carbon chain provides a balance between hydrophobic interactions and steric accessibility, optimizing the modifier's interaction with the catalyst.

7. **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted halomethyl group** result in a **high yield** (**True**). Modifiers with halogens directly attached to the ring or without the methyl spacer result in a **low yield** (**False**).

   - *High Yield Example*: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-bromobenzoic acid.
   - *Explanation*: The halomethyl group can enhance coordination through halogen bonding or by acting as a leaving group, facilitating catalytic activity. Direct halogen substitution lacks this flexibility.

8. **Modifiers with **electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., **nitro**, **aldehyde**, **fluoroalkyl**) attached to the aromatic ring result in a **low yield** (**False**). These groups decrease coordination ability.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.
   - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions crucial for catalytic efficiency.

9. **Modifiers that are **amino acids** with **bulky aromatic side chains** attached to the **alpha-carbon** result in a **low yield** (**False**). Those with smaller side chains or additional coordinating groups result in a **high yield** (**True**).

   - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).
   - *Explanation*: Bulky side chains introduce steric hindrance, interfering with coordination between the modifier and the metal catalyst.

10. **Modifiers that contain **flexible ether chains** (e.g., **polyether segments**) result in a **low yield** (**False**). The flexibility and lack of coordinating sites reduce effectiveness.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.
    - *Explanation*: Flexible ether chains may adopt conformations that do not favor effective interaction with the metal center, and ethers are weaker ligands compared to amines or carboxylates.

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Justification:**

- **Combination of Substructures**: Each rule integrates multiple functional groups or structural elements (e.g., amino groups near carboxyl groups, aromatic rings with specific substituents) to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these features collectively influence the yield.

- **Physical-Chemical Properties Considered**:
  - **Chelation**: Proximity of coordinating groups (amino, hydroxyl, thiol) to the carboxyl group enhances chelation with the metal catalyst.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups enhance metal-ligand interactions, while electron-withdrawing groups diminish them.
  - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents can impede effective coordination due to physical blockage.
  - **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Optimal chain lengths and rigidity can facilitate better positioning of coordinating groups for interaction with the catalyst.

- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule specifies the structural criteria that predict a high or low yield, allowing for clear classification of modifiers based on their molecular structure.

- **Coverage Balance**: The rules are designed to cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, balancing simplicity and specificity:
  - **Simple Rules with High Coverage**: Rules 1, 2, and 8 address common features affecting many modifiers.
  - **Complex Rules with Lower Coverage**: Rules 5 and 7 focus on specific functional groups that, while less common, significantly impact yield when present.

- **Rule Improvement**: The rules have been refined to eliminate redundancies and enhance clarity. For example, previous rules regarding modifiers with ketone or aldehyde groups (Rule 13 from the current rules) were integrated into Rule 8 for a more cohesive understanding of electron-withdrawing effects.

By applying these rules, one can predict the likely impact of a given molecular modifier on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules emphasize the importance of molecular features that influence metal coordination, which is critical for catalytic activity in this reaction system. Understanding these relationships aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize reaction outcomes.---------------------------------------------------------------

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** containing an **amino group at the α-position** (adjacent to the carboxyl group) result in a **high yield** (**True**). If the amino group is further away, the yield is **low** (**False**).**

   - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
   - *Explanation*: Amino groups at the α-position enhance chelation with metal centers due to their proximity, improving catalyst performance. As the amino group moves further from the carboxyl group, chelation efficiency decreases.

2. **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted group capable of coordination** (e.g., **amino**, **hydroxyl**, **pyridyl**) result in a **high yield** (**True**). Substituents that are **electron-withdrawing** or lack coordinating ability result in a **low yield** (**False**).**

   - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.
   - *Explanation*: Electron-donating and coordinating groups at the para position enhance interaction with metal centers. Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on the aromatic ring, weakening coordination.

3. **Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** containing **nitrogen atoms** in the ring result in a **high yield** (**True**).**

   - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid.
   - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing interaction and catalytic performance.

4. **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **multiple hydroxyl groups** near the **carboxyl group** result in a **high yield** (**True**). Modifiers with **single or distant hydroxyl groups** result in a **low yield** (**False**).**

   - *High Yield Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid), 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.
   - *Low Yield Example*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.
   - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups close to the carboxyl group enhance chelation through multiple coordination points. Single or distant hydroxyl groups provide less effective coordination.

5. **Modifiers containing a **thiol group** within **three carbons** of the **carboxyl group** result in a **high yield** (**True**). If the thiol group is in an **aromatic system** or farther away, the yield is **low** (**False**).**

   - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
   - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
   - *Explanation*: Thiol groups near the carboxyl group enhance chelation due to sulfur's high affinity for metals. In aromatic systems or with distant thiol groups, steric and electronic factors reduce coordination efficiency.

6. **Modifiers with **electron-withdrawing groups** adjacent to the **carboxyl group** result in a **low yield** (**False**).**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.
   - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions essential for catalytic activity.

7. **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **long hydrocarbon chains** and **no additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield** (**False**).**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: Octanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
   - *Explanation*: Lack of proximal coordinating groups reduces the ability to interact effectively with the metal center, diminishing catalytic efficiency.

8. **Modifiers with **flexible ether chains** result in a **low yield** (**False**).**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.
   - *Explanation*: Flexible ether chains may prevent the modifier from adopting conformations favorable for effective metal coordination. Ethers are weaker ligands compared to amines or carboxylates.

9. **Modifiers that are **amino acids** with side chains containing **nitrogen capable of coordination** (e.g., **indole ring** in tryptophan) result in a **high yield** (**True**). Those with side chains lacking coordinating ability result in a **low yield** (**False**).**

   - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).
   - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine).
   - *Explanation*: Functional groups capable of coordination, like the nitrogen in the indole ring, enhance interaction with the catalyst. Side chains without such functionalities offer less coordination.

10. **Modifiers with an **amide linkage** near the **carboxyl group** result in a **low yield** (**False**).**

    - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid.
    - *Explanation*: Amide groups may reduce the coordination ability of nearby functional groups due to resonance and potential steric hindrance, impeding effective metal interaction.

11. **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with an **ortho-hydroxy group** result in a **low yield** (**False**).**

    - *Low Yield Example*: 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
    - *Explanation*: The ortho-hydroxy group can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing its availability to coordinate with the metal center.

12. **Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl groups** result in a **low yield** (**False**).**

    - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.
    - *Explanation*: Strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorinated groups decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions.

13. **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted bromomethyl group** result in a **high yield** (**True**).**

    - *High Yield Example*: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.
    - *Explanation*: The bromomethyl group can enhance coordination due to the bromine's ability to interact with metal centers or influence electronic properties to favor coordination.

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Justification:**

- **Combination of Substructures**: Each rule integrates multiple structural features (e.g., functional groups, positions, chain lengths) to explain the modifiers' impact on yield. This considers how combinations of functional groups influence metal coordination.

- **Physical-Chemical Properties Considered**:
  - **Metal Coordination**: The proximity and nature of coordinating atoms (N, O, S) enhance catalyst performance through chelation.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on coordinating atoms, strengthening metal-ligand interactions. Electron-withdrawing groups have the opposite effect.
  - **Steric Factors**: The spatial arrangement and size of substituents affect the ability of the modifier to coordinate effectively with the metal center.
  - **Hydrogen Bonding and Intramolecular Interactions**: Functional groups that engage in intramolecular interactions may be less available for coordination with the metal catalyst.

- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule specifies clear structural criteria, allowing for accurate prediction of high or low yield based on the modifier's molecular structure.

- **Coverage Balance**:
  - **Simple Rules with High Coverage**: Rules 1, 2, and 3 address common features influencing many modifiers.
  - **Complex Rules with Specificity**: Rules 9, 10, and 13 focus on particular functional groups or structural motifs that significantly impact yield when present.

- **Rule Improvement**:
  - **Alignment with Data**: The rules have been revised to ensure they accurately reflect the observed yields in the dataset.
  - **Correction of Contradictions**: Previous inconsistencies (e.g., octanoic acid yielding high results despite lacking coordinating groups) have been addressed.
  - **Inclusion of Additional Examples**: More examples have been added to clarify each rule and enhance understanding.

By applying these improved rules, one can more accurately predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. These rules emphasize the importance of molecular features that influence metal coordination, electronic effects, and steric factors—critical aspects for catalytic activity in this reaction system.

Understanding these relationships facilitates the rational design and selection of modifiers, optimizing reaction outcomes and advancing the efficiency of chemical syntheses involving such catalytic systems.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    Based on the analysis of the dataset and consideration of the underlying chemical properties, here is a refined set of rules that describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the yield of the reaction:

---

**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with acidic side chains containing additional carboxyl groups (dicarboxylic amino acids) result in a high yield (True).**

   - *Rationale*: The presence of multiple carboxylate groups and an α-amino group enhances coordination with metal centers like Fe, stabilizing the catalyst.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
     - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

2. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-position amino or nitro groups result in a high yield (True); those with para-position methyl or formyl groups result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Amino and nitro groups can participate in metal coordination or enhance electron withdrawal, increasing acidity and metal-binding ability. Methyl and formyl groups can reduce this effect or introduce steric hindrance.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - 4-aminobenzoic acid
     - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 4-methylbenzoic acid
     - 4-formylbenzoic acid

3. **Modifiers that are medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (C6–C8) without additional polar functional groups result in a high yield (True); the presence of polar substituents (e.g., hydroxyl, amino groups) results in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Non-polar aliphatic chains promote hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, enhancing activity. Polar groups can interfere with metal coordination or alter solubility unfavorably.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - Octanoic acid
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
     - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
     - 8-aminooctanoic acid

4. **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (polyhydroxylated acids) result in a high yield (True).**

   - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal centers and increase solubility, enhancing catalyst performance.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
     - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

5. **Modifiers with an aromatic ring attached via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in a high yield (True); chains of three carbons or fewer result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the aromatic ring to interact effectively with the metal center, whereas shorter chains limit this flexibility.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

6. **Modifiers containing pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a high yield (True); those connected via rigid aromatic linkers result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: The pyridine nitrogen atom can coordinate with metal centers, improving catalyst activity. Direct attachment enhances this interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
     - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

7. **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol (sulfanyl) groups result in a high yield (True); those with thiol groups attached to aromatic rings result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols form strong metal-sulfur bonds without steric hindrance, enhancing catalyst efficiency. Aromatic thiols may have reduced accessibility due to conjugation with the aromatic system.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

8. **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups (e.g., perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl) result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal binding and diminishing catalyst performance.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
     - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

9. **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains may not effectively coordinate with metal centers due to their conformational freedom, reducing catalyst efficiency.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
     - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

10. **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic side chains result in a high yield (True); those with aromatic side chains lacking nitrogen heterocycles result in a low yield (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles provide additional coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst performance.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

11. **Modifiers with bulky acyl or acetamido groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a low yield (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Bulky substituents can cause steric hindrance, reducing the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal center.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

12. **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a high yield (True); certain oxygen-containing heterocycles may also enhance yield depending on their ability to coordinate with metals.**

    - *Rationale*: Heterocyclic nitrogen atoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
    - *High Yield Examples*:
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

13. **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in a low yield (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or reduce the electron density necessary for effective metal coordination.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

14. **Modifiers with methoxy-substituted aromatic rings attached via longer aliphatic chains result in a high yield (True).**

    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups can influence electron density and may enhance interactions with the metal center through electron donation or by affecting the overall conformation.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

15. **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with additional amino groups (diamino acids) result in a high yield (True).**

    - *Rationale*: Additional amino groups increase coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst performance.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid

**End of Rules**

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains containing additional carboxyl groups (dicarboxylic amino acids) result in a high yield (True).**

   - *Rationale*: The presence of extra carboxylate groups enhances coordination with metal centers like Fe, stabilizing the catalyst and improving its activity.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
     - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

2. **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles result in a high yield (True); those with non-heterocyclic aromatic side chains result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen-containing heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. Non-heterocyclic aromatic rings lack this coordinating ability.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

3. **Modifiers that are saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids with a carbon chain length of eight carbons (octanoic acid) result in a high yield (True).**

   - *Rationale*: Non-polar aliphatic chains promote hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, enhancing activity.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - Octanoic acid

4. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents (e.g., hydroxy or amino groups) result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Polar groups can interfere with metal coordination or alter solubility unfavorably, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
     - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
     - 8-aminooctanoic acid

5. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers (such as amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups) result in a high yield (True); those with methyl or formyl groups result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Functional groups that can coordinate with metal ions enhance catalyst activity by facilitating stronger binding to the metal center.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - 4-aminobenzoic acid
     - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
     - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 4-methylbenzoic acid
     - 4-formylbenzoic acid

6. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups may engage in side reactions or reduce the electron density necessary for effective metal coordination.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 4-formylbenzoic acid
     - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
     - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

7. **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (polyhydroxylated acids) result in a high yield (True).**

   - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal centers and increase solubility, enhancing catalyst performance.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
     - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

8. **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains may not effectively coordinate with metal centers due to their conformational freedom, reducing catalyst efficiency.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
     - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

9. **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups (e.g., perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl) result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal binding and diminishing catalyst performance.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
     - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

10. **Modifiers with aromatic rings attached via aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in a high yield (True); chains of three carbons or fewer result in a low yield (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the aromatic ring to interact effectively with the metal center, whereas shorter chains limit this flexibility.
    - *High Yield Examples*:
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

11. **Modifiers containing aliphatic thiol (sulfanyl) groups result in a high yield (True); those with thiol groups attached to aromatic rings result in a low yield (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols form strong metal-sulfur bonds without steric hindrance, enhancing catalyst efficiency. Aromatic thiols may have reduced accessibility due to conjugation with the aromatic system.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

12. **Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a high yield (True); those where the pyridine ring is linked via another aromatic ring result in a low yield (False).**

    - *Rationale*: The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. Direct attachment facilitates this interaction.
    - *High Yield Examples*:
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

13. **Modifiers with methoxy-substituted aromatic rings attached via longer aliphatic chains result in a high yield (True).**

    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups can influence electron density and may enhance interactions with the metal center through electron donation or by affecting the overall conformation.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

14. **Modifiers with bulky acyl or acetamido groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a low yield (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Bulky substituents can cause steric hindrance, reducing the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal center effectively.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

15. **Modifiers containing ketone groups (carbonyl groups) in the aliphatic chain result in a low yield (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups in the chain may introduce steric hindrance or alter electronic properties, reducing metal coordination efficiency.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are derived from analyzing the structural features of the molecular modifiers and understanding how these features influence the reaction yield. They consider combinations of functional groups, chain lengths, and their positions within the molecules, aligning with the underlying physicochemical principles that govern metal coordination and catalyst activity. The rules balance coverage and specificity, aiming to predict the yield outcome for modifiers with similar structural characteristics.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of coordinating through carboxylate or amino groups result in a high yield (True); those with bulky or aromatic side chains result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Coordinating side chains enhance interaction with the metal center (Fe ion), stabilizing the catalyst and improving activity. Bulky or aromatic side chains may hinder this interaction due to steric effects or lack of coordinating atoms.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(Aspartic acid)*
     - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(Glutamic acid)*
     - 5-aminopentanoic acid
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid *(Phenylalanine)*
     - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid *(Tryptophan)*
     - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

2. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted coordinating groups (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in a high yield (True); those with non-coordinating or electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., methyl, formyl, sulfanyl) result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Coordinating groups at the para position enhance binding to the metal center, improving catalyst performance. Non-coordinating or electron-withdrawing groups do not facilitate effective interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - 4-aminobenzoic acid
     - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
     - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 4-methylbenzoic acid
     - 4-formylbenzoic acid
     - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

3. **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids with the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a high yield (True); if the nitrogen-containing ring is connected through another aromatic ring or substituents, the yield is low (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows the nitrogen heterocycle to coordinate effectively with the metal center. Indirect attachment reduces this interaction due to steric hindrance or electronic effects.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Niacin)*
     - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
     - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
     - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid *(Phenylalanine)*

4. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with aliphatic chains of five carbons or more result in a high yield (True); introduction of polar substituents (e.g., hydroxy, amino) into the chain reduces the yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Long non-polar chains may enhance hydrophobic interactions and allow better arrangement around the metal center. Polar groups can interfere with these interactions or disrupt coordination.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - Octanoic acid
     - 5-aminopentanoic acid *(due to minimal steric hindrance and potential coordination via amino group)*
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
     - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
     - 8-aminooctanoic acid

5. **Modifiers containing aliphatic thiol (sulfanyl) groups result in a high yield (True); those with thiol groups attached to aromatic rings result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols can form strong metal-sulfur bonds without steric hindrance, enhancing catalyst efficiency. Aromatic thiols may have reduced accessibility due to conjugation and steric factors.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

6. **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (having multiple hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons) result in a high yield (True); those with hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups in aliphatic chains can chelate the metal center, strengthening coordination and enhancing catalyst performance. Aromatic hydroxyls are less effective in coordination.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(Gluconic acid)*
     - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
     - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

7. **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal binding and diminishing catalyst performance.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
     - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

8. **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms may not coordinate effectively due to conformational flexibility and lack of optimal orbital overlap with the metal center.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
     - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

9. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups on the aromatic ring result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or reduce coordination efficiency with the metal center by acting as electron-withdrawing groups.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 4-formylbenzoic acid
     - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

10. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids linked to substituted aromatic rings via flexible aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in a high yield (True); chains of three carbons or fewer result in a low yield (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the substituted aromatic ring to interact favorably with the metal center. Shorter chains limit this flexibility.
    - *High Yield Examples*:
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

11. **Modifiers containing bulky acyl or acetamido groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a low yield (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Bulky substituents cause steric hindrance, reducing the modifier’s ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

12. **Modifiers with methoxy-substituted aromatic rings attached via flexible aliphatic chains result in a high yield (True).**

    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups enhance electron density on the aromatic ring, potentially improving π-interactions with the metal center and affecting the overall conformation favorably.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

13. **Modifiers with multiple conjugated carbonyl groups within an aromatic system result in a high yield (True).**

    - *Rationale*: Conjugated carbonyl groups can participate in resonance stabilization and coordinate effectively with the metal center.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

14. **Modifiers that are small nitrogen-containing heterocycles with a carboxyl group directly attached result in a high yield (True).**

    - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles enhance coordination with the metal center, improving catalyst activity due to additional coordination sites.
    - *High Yield Examples*:
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

15. **Modifiers where polar substituents are introduced into long-chain aliphatic acids reduce the yield (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Introducing polar groups into long aliphatic chains may disrupt hydrophobic interactions and interfere with optimal coordination geometry around the metal center.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are formulated based on an analysis of the dataset and the underlying physicochemical principles governing metal coordination and catalyst activity. They illustrate how specific combinations of structural features in the molecular modifiers influence the reaction yield:

- **Coordinating Functional Groups**: Presence of amino, carboxylate, or nitrogen-containing heterocycles enhances coordination with the Fe ion, leading to higher yields.
- **Steric Effects**: Bulky groups or substituents can hinder effective coordination due to steric hindrance, resulting in lower yields.
- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy) can enhance metal interactions, while electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., fluorinated chains, aldehydes) reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, decreasing yield.
- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing better positioning for coordination. Introduction of polar groups into these chains can disrupt beneficial interactions.
- **Conjugation and Aromaticity**: Conjugated systems with coordinating groups can stabilize interactions with the metal center, improving catalyst performance.

By combining multiple sub-structures and considering their positions within the molecules, these rules aim to predict the reaction outcome effectively. They balance coverage of the dataset with specificity, providing a comprehensive understanding of how molecular modifiers affect the yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with additional coordinating groups near the carboxylate result in a high yield (True); amino acids with non-coordinating or bulky hydrophobic side chains result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: The α-amino group provides strong chelation with Fe ions. Additional coordinating groups enhance this effect, while bulky hydrophobic side chains hinder coordination due to steric effects.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(Aspartic acid)*
     - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(Glutamic acid)*
     - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid *(Tryptophan)*
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid *(Phenylalanine)*

2. **Modifiers with coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy, thiol) within three atoms of the carboxylate group result in a high yield (True); when these groups are further away, the yield is low (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Proximity of coordinating groups to the carboxylate enhances chelation with Fe ions. Increased distance reduces chelation efficiency.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - 5-aminopentanoic acid
     - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
     - 8-aminooctanoic acid

3. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups at the para position (e.g., amino, hydroxy, nitro, bromomethyl) result in a high yield (True); non-coordinating substituents or electron-donating groups at this position result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Para-substituted coordinating groups enhance interaction with Fe ions, improving catalyst performance. Non-coordinating groups do not facilitate this interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - 4-aminobenzoic acid
     - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
     - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 4-methylbenzoic acid
     - 4-formylbenzoic acid

4. **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles with carboxylic acid groups result in a high yield (True); if the nitrogen heterocycle is disconnected from the carboxylate or sterically hindered, the yield is low (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles coordinate effectively with Fe ions. Disconnection or steric hindrance reduces coordination efficiency.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Niacin)*
     - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

5. **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) adjacent to the carboxylate group result in a low yield (False); exceptions occur when EWGs are part of a coordinating system that enhances chelation, resulting in a high yield (True).**

   - *Rationale*: EWGs reduce electron density, weakening Fe ion coordination. However, if they form part of a coordinating conjugated system, they can enhance chelation.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 4-formylbenzoic acid
     - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

6. **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate result in a high yield (True).**

   - *Rationale*: Polyhydroxylated compounds enhance chelation with Fe ions through multiple coordination sites.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(Gluconic acid)*
     - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

7. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long non-polar carbon chains (six carbons or more) and no polar substituents result in a high yield (True); introduction of polar groups distant from the carboxylate reduces the yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Long non-polar chains may enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface. Distant polar groups can disrupt these interactions.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - Octanoic acid
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
     - 8-aminooctanoic acid

8. **Modifiers with ether linkages or flexible polyether chains result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Ether oxygens may not coordinate effectively due to flexibility and unfavorable conformations, reducing interaction with Fe ions.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
     - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

9. **Modifiers with bulky substituents near coordination sites (e.g., bulky groups adjacent to the carboxylate) result in a low yield (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes effective coordination with Fe ions.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid *(Phenylalanine)*
     - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

10. **Modifiers with thiol groups near the carboxylate result in a high yield (True); if the thiol group is attached directly to an aromatic ring, the yield is low (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols coordinate well with Fe ions, while aromatic thiols may suffer from steric or electronic factors that reduce coordination efficiency.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

11. **Modifiers containing aromatic rings connected to the carboxylate via flexible aliphatic chains with coordinating groups result in a high yield (True); shorter chains without flexibility result in a low yield (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Flexible chains allow coordinating groups on aromatic rings to effectively interact with Fe ions.
    - *High Yield Examples*:
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

12. **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups result in a low yield (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing effects reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening Fe ion binding.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
      - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

13. **Modifiers with aldehyde or keto groups adjacent to the carboxylate result in a low yield (False); ketones within a conjugated system that can coordinate with Fe ions result in a high yield (True).**

    - *Rationale*: Isolated carbonyl groups can reduce coordination efficiency, but conjugated carbonyls can enhance chelation through resonance.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid

14. **Modifiers with coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) at the γ or δ position relative to the carboxylate result in a high yield (True); if these groups are positioned further away (ε or beyond), the yield is low (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Coordinating groups within a close range enhance Fe ion chelation. Increased distance diminishes this effect.
    - *High Yield Examples*:
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid *(γ-amino acid)*
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

15. **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings connected via flexible chains result in a high yield (True); rigid systems without such flexibility result in a low yield (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups enhance electron density, improving coordination. Flexible chains allow better spatial arrangement for Fe ion interaction.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid *(rigid linkage)*

**End of Rules**

---

These rules capture the relationship between molecular modifiers' structural features and their impact on the reaction yield, grounded in underlying physicochemical principles:

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions (e.g., amino, hydroxy, thiol, nitrogen heterocycles) enhance catalytic activity. Proximity to the carboxylate is critical for effective chelation.

- **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents near coordination sites hinder effective interaction with Fe ions, reducing yield due to steric hindrance.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on coordinating atoms, strengthening Fe ion binding. Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density, weakening coordination.

- **Hydrophobic Interactions**: Long non-polar chains without polar substituents may enhance interactions with the catalyst surface, favoring better spatial arrangement around Fe ions.

- **Conjugation and Aromaticity**: Conjugated systems with coordinating groups can stabilize metal interactions through resonance, enhancing catalytic performance.

- **Chain Flexibility**: Flexible aliphatic chains allow coordinating groups to adopt favorable conformations for Fe ion interaction. Rigid systems may limit effective coordination.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. The rules strike a balance between broader applicability and specificity, covering a wide range of modifiers while highlighting key functional group combinations that influence the reaction outcome.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with hydrophilic side chains or additional carboxylate groups result in a high yield; those with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains result in a low yield.**

   - *Rationale*: The α-amino and carboxylate groups can chelate Fe ions effectively, enhancing catalytic performance. Hydrophilic side chains provide additional coordination sites or favorable interactions, while hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains may hinder coordination due to steric hindrance or lack of coordinating atoms.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(N-Acetyllysine)*

2. **Modifiers with coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy, thiol) within three carbon atoms of the carboxylate group result in a high yield; if the coordinating group is more than three carbons away, the yield is low.**

   - *Rationale*: Proximity of coordinating groups enhances their ability to chelate Fe ions, improving catalyst activity. Distant functional groups are less effective due to decreased interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

3. **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy, methoxy) at the para position result in a high yield; those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl) or non-coordinating groups result in a low yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring and coordinating atoms, enhancing Fe ion binding. Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density, weakening coordination.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(Note: Though nitro is electron-withdrawing, it can participate in coordination due to its ability to delocalize charge)*
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

4. **Modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylate group result in a high yield; if the nitrogen heterocycle is separated by additional rings or chains, the yield is low.**

   - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows nitrogen atoms in heterocycles to coordinate efficiently with Fe ions. Separation reduces the effectiveness of coordination due to increased distance.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Niacin)*
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

5. **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in a low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects.**

   - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated groups are highly electron-withdrawing, reducing electron density on coordinating atoms, and thus weakening coordination with Fe ions.
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

6. **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and distant coordinating groups result in a low yield due to decreased coordination efficiency.**

   - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains increase conformational entropy and distance between coordinating groups and the Fe ion, reducing effective binding.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

7. **Modifiers with thiol groups (–SH) within three carbons of the carboxylate result in a high yield; thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings result in a low yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively with Fe ions due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur. Aromatic thiols are less effective because the lone pair on sulfur is delocalized into the aromatic system.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

8. **Modifiers with conjugated keto groups adjacent to the carboxylate group result in a high yield; isolated keto or aldehyde groups without conjugation result in a low yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Conjugation stabilizes the enol form and enhances electron density on coordinating oxygen atoms, improving Fe ion binding. Isolated carbonyl groups without conjugation do not provide this benefit.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

9. **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of six to eight carbons and no additional functional groups result in a high yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length facilitates hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, aiding in effective Fe ion coordination without interference from other functional groups.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **Octanoic acid**

10. **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings can result in a high yield if they enhance electron density and coordination ability.**

    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are electron-donating, increasing electron density on the ring and adjacent coordinating atoms, improving Fe ion coordination.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

11. **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindering groups near the coordination sites result in a low yield.**

    - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance impedes the access of Fe ions to coordinating atoms, reducing the effectiveness of the catalyst.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(N-Acetyllysine)*
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*

12. **Modifiers with amino acids containing indole rings result in a high yield due to additional coordination sites on the indole nitrogen.**

    - *Rationale*: The indole nitrogen provides an extra site for Fe coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*

13. **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., aldehyde, keto) adjacent to the aromatic ring or carboxylate group result in a low yield.**

    - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening Fe ion binding and reducing catalytic activity.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

14. **Modifiers with coordinating groups attached to an aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain of four or five carbons result in a high yield; shorter chains may result in a low yield due to steric constraints.**

    - *Rationale*: Adequate chain length allows the coordinating group to reach and effectively interact with Fe ions while avoiding steric hindrance from the aromatic ring.
    - *High Yield Examples*:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

15. **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate group result in a high yield due to enhanced chelation with Fe ions.**

    - *Rationale*: Adjacent hydroxyl groups provide additional sites for coordination, strengthening Fe ion binding.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*

**Rationalization of the Rules**

These rules are derived from an analysis of the structural features of the modifiers and their correlation with the reaction yield, considering fundamental chemical principles:

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups capable of donating electron pairs (e.g., amino, hydroxy, thiol, nitrogen heterocycles) are crucial for forming coordination bonds with Fe ions. The spatial arrangement and proximity of these groups significantly affect their coordination efficiency.
- **Steric Effects**: Bulky groups near potential coordination sites can hinder the approach and binding of Fe ions due to steric hindrance, reducing catalytic activity.
- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups increase the electron density on coordinating atoms, enhancing Fe ion binding. Electron-withdrawing groups have the opposite effect, weakening coordination.
- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Optimal chain lengths promote favorable interactions between the modifier and the catalyst. Chains that are too long, too short, or overly flexible may decrease coordination efficiency due to entropic factors or steric limitations.
- **Conjugation and Aromaticity**: Conjugated systems can delocalize electron density, enhancing the ability of coordinating atoms to bind Fe ions through resonance stabilization.

---

**Application of the Rules**

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the reaction yield based on the structural characteristics of new molecular modifiers:

- **High Yield Predictors**:
  - **α-Amino Acids with Hydrophilic Side Chains**: Modifiers like aspartic acid and glutamic acid have side chains that enhance Fe coordination.
  - **Proximity of Coordinating Groups**: Functional groups within three carbons of the carboxylate group, such as in 5-aminopentanoic acid, improve yield.
  - **Electron-Donating Groups on Aromatic Rings**: Compounds like 4-aminobenzoic acid have increased electron density for better Fe binding.
  - **Directly Attached Nitrogen Heterocycles**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid offers effective coordination sites.
  - **Conjugated Keto Groups**: Compounds like 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid benefit from enhanced coordination via enolization.
  - **Optimal Chain Lengths**: Octanoic acid demonstrates favorable interactions due to its hydrophobic tail.
  - **Multiple Coordinating Groups**: Gluconic acid's multiple hydroxyl groups provide strong Fe binding.
  - **Amino Acids with Additional Coordination Sites**: Tryptophan's indole ring offers extra coordination ability.

- **Low Yield Predictors**:
  - **Distant Coordinating Groups**: Compounds like 7-aminoheptanoic acid have less effective Fe interaction.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Modifiers such as 4-formylbenzoic acid reduce electron density on coordinating atoms.
  - **Perfluorinated Chains**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects in compounds like nonafluoropentanoic acid weaken Fe binding.
  - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky side chains in N-acetyllysine impede coordination.
  - **Flexible Ether Linkages**: Compounds with distant coordinating groups due to flexible chains show decreased yield.
  - **Aromatic Thiols**: Delocalization of electron pairs in 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid reduces coordination efficiency.

  - *Analysis*: Amino group is within three carbons of the carboxylate group (Rule 2).
  - *Prediction*: High yield.
  - *Outcome*: Consistent with data (high yield).

  - *Outcome*: Consistent with data (high yield).

- **Modifier**: **4-formylbenzoic acid**

  - *Analysis*: Electron-withdrawing formyl group at the para position of the aromatic ring (Rule 3 and 13).
  - *Prediction*: Low yield.
  - *Outcome*: Consistent with data (low yield).

- **Modifier**: **Octanoic acid**

  - *Analysis*: Aliphatic carboxylic acid with optimal chain length and no interfering functional groups (Rule 9).
  - *Prediction*: High yield.
  - *Outcome*: Consistent with data (high yield).

- **Modifier**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*

  - *Analysis*: Amino acid with an indole ring providing additional coordination (Rule 12).
  - *Prediction*: High yield.
  - *Outcome*: Consistent with data (high yield).

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with acidic side chains (additional carboxyl groups) result in a high yield.**

   - *Rationale*: The extra carboxylate enhances coordination with Fe ions, improving catalyst activity.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

2. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino (–NH₂) group directly attached to the ring yield high results.**

   - *Rationale*: Amino groups enhance electron density and coordinate effectively with Fe ions.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

3. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, diminishing Fe ion coordination.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

4. **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with a thiol (–SH) group within three carbon atoms of the acid group result in a high yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Thiol groups are strong ligands that enhance metal coordination.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

5. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups result in a high yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length facilitates favorable interactions without steric hindrance.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **Octanoic acid**

6. **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in a high yield; if the heterocycle is connected via an additional ring or linker, the yield is low.**

   - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows nitrogen atoms to effectively coordinate with Fe ions.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

7. **Modifiers featuring perfluoroalkyl groups near the carboxylic acid result in a low yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing, reducing coordination ability with Fe ions.
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

8. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) or hydroxyl (–OH) groups more than three carbon atoms away from the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating with Fe ions.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

9. **Modifiers possessing electron-donating methoxy (–OCH₃) groups on an aromatic ring enhance yield when the methoxy group is ortho or para to the carboxylic acid.**

   - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density, improving Fe ion coordination.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

10. **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and distant coordinating groups lead to a low yield.**

    - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase flexibility, decreasing the effective concentration of the coordinating group near the catalyst.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

11. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with nitro (–NO₂) groups yield high results.**

    - *Rationale*: Nitro groups can coordinate with Fe ions through oxygen atoms, enhancing metal binding.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

12. **Modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents directly attached to the coordinating site result in a low yield due to steric hindrance.**

    - *Rationale*: Bulky groups impede Fe ion access to coordinating atoms.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

13. **Modifiers with conjugated keto groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid result in a high yield.**

    - *Rationale*: Conjugation stabilizes coordination structures through resonance, enhancing Fe ion binding.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

14. **Modifiers featuring halogen substituents on the aromatic ring result in a high yield.**

    - *Rationale*: Halogens can enhance interactions due to their electronegativity and ability to participate in coordination.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

15. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino (–NH₂) group within three carbon atoms of the carboxyl group result in a high yield; if the amino group is further away, the yield is low.**

    - *Rationale*: Proximal amino groups enhance coordination with Fe ions, while distant ones are less effective.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with acidic side chains (additional carboxyl groups) result in a high yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Additional carboxylate groups enhance coordination with Fe ions, improving catalyst activity.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

2. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino (–NH₂) group within three carbon atoms of the carboxyl group yield high results; if the amino group is further away, the yield is low.**

   - *Rationale*: Proximal amino groups effectively coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing the catalyst's reactivity, while distant amino groups are less effective.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

3. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups result in a high yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length facilitates favorable interactions without steric hindrance or electronic effects from additional groups.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **Octanoic acid**

4. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (–OH) or amino (–NH₂) groups more than three carbon atoms away from the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Distant functional groups do not effectively coordinate with Fe ions and may introduce unfavorable flexibility.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

5. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino (–NH₂) group directly attached to the ring yield high results.**

   - *Rationale*: Amino groups enhance electron density and coordinate effectively with Fe ions.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

6. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) ortho or para to the carboxyl group enhance the yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with Fe ions.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
     - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Low yield despite hydroxyl group; may be due to chain length or positioning)

7. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in varying yields depending on the ability of the substituent to coordinate with Fe ions.**

   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density but may coordinate through additional mechanisms.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (High yield; nitro group can coordinate via oxygen atoms)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in a high yield; if the heterocycle is connected via an additional ring or linker, the yield is low.**

   - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows nitrogen atoms to effectively coordinate with Fe ions, whereas additional linkers reduce this interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

9. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol (–SH) groups within three carbon atoms of the acid group result in a high yield; if the thiol group is part of an aromatic ring, the yield is low.**

   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups are strong coordinating ligands; aromatic thiol groups may be less effective due to resonance stabilization.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

10. **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains near the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

    - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing, reducing the ability of coordinating atoms to interact with Fe ions.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

11. **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and distant coordinating groups lead to a low yield.**

    - *Rationale*: Increased flexibility and distance reduce the effective concentration of coordinating groups near the Fe ions.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

12. **Modifiers featuring bulky aromatic substituents directly attached to the coordinating site result in a low yield due to steric hindrance.**

    - *Rationale*: Bulky groups impede Fe ion access to coordinating atoms, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

13. **Modifiers with conjugated keto groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid result in a high yield.**

    - *Rationale*: Conjugation stabilizes coordination structures through resonance, enhancing Fe ion binding.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

14. **Modifiers featuring halogen substituents on the aromatic ring result in a high yield if the halogen is capable of participating in coordination or enhancing electron density.**

    - *Rationale*: Halogens can engage in coordination or affect electronic properties favorably.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

15. **Modifiers that are sugars or sugar-derived acids result in a high yield due to multiple hydroxyl groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions.**

    - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination with the catalyst.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

**End of Rules**

These rules have been carefully analyzed and refined to maximize coverage of the dataset while considering underlying physical and chemical properties. They provide clear guidance on predicting high or low yields based on the molecular features of the modifiers.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: yield

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are alpha-amino acids with a side chain carboxylate group (dicarboxylic amino acids) result in a high yield.**

   - *Rationale*: The presence of both the amino group and the side chain carboxylate allows for multiple coordination sites with Fe ions, enhancing catalyst performance through chelation.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*

2. **Modifiers that are alpha-amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains (e.g., indole ring) result in a high yield; those with non-heteroaromatic side chains result in a low yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen can coordinate with Fe ions via lone pairs, enhancing catalyst activity. Non-heteroaromatic rings lack this coordination ability.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*

3. **Linear aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino, sulfhydryl, or hydroxyl groups within three carbons of the carboxylate result in a high yield; if these groups are more than five carbons away, the yield is low.**

   - *Rationale*: Proximal functional groups form stable five- or six-membered chelate rings with Fe ions, enhancing coordination. Distant groups are less effective due to reduced chelation efficiency.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

4. **Aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino or nitro groups result in a high yield; those with non-coordinating substituents or electron-donating groups result in a low yield.**

   - *Rationale*: Para-substituted amino and nitro groups can enhance coordination with Fe ions through resonance and inductive effects, improving catalyst activity. Non-coordinating or electron-donating groups do not facilitate this interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

5. **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids result in a high yield, enhancing coordination with Fe ions.**

   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and can facilitate stronger interactions with metal ions.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

6. **Heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring adjacent to the carboxylate group result in a high yield due to effective coordination via the nitrogen atom.**

   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can donate lone pairs to Fe ions, forming strong coordination bonds.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Nicotinic acid)*
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

7. **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate group (polyhydroxylated acids) result in a high yield; if hydroxyl groups are distant, the yield is low.**

   - *Rationale*: Proximal hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with Fe ions by providing multiple coordination sites. Distant hydroxyl groups do not effectively participate in coordination.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

8. **Simple linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in a high yield due to favorable integration into the catalyst structure and minimal steric hindrance.**

   - *Rationale*: The unbranched structure allows for optimal packing and coordination with Fe ions without interference.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **Octanoic acid**

9. **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages or polyether chains result in a low yield due to decreased coordination efficiency and increased conformational flexibility.**

   - *Rationale*: Excessive flexibility reduces the likelihood of effective chelation with Fe ions, and ether oxygens may not coordinate strongly.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

10. **Modifiers with aromatic rings connected to the carboxylate via aliphatic chains of four or more carbons and bearing coordinating substituents (e.g., hydroxyl groups) result in a high yield; shorter chains lead to a low yield.**

    - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length positions coordinating groups effectively for interaction with Fe ions. Short chains may not allow proper alignment for coordination.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

11. **Modifiers containing aldehyde or keto groups adjacent to the carboxylate result in a low yield due to potential deactivation of the catalyst or interference with coordination.**

    - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and keto groups can engage in side reactions or alter electron density around the carboxylate, hindering effective coordination with Fe ions.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

12. **Modifiers with electron-rich heterocycles bearing carboxylate groups result in a high yield due to enhanced binding with Fe ions.**

    - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heterocycles (e.g., pyrazole, pyridone) can coordinate with Fe ions through their heteroatoms, improving catalyst performance.
    - *High Yield Examples*:
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

13. **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in a low yield due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature and poor coordination ability.**

    - *Rationale*: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduce electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, diminishing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

14. **Modifiers containing bulky or sterically hindered groups near the coordinating site result in a low yield due to interference with effective Fe ion coordination.**

    - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance impedes the close approach required for coordination between the modifier and Fe ions.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

15. **Modifiers with side chains capable of hydrogen bonding or forming additional interactions with the catalyst framework result in a high yield due to increased stability and effective coordination.**

    - *Rationale*: Additional interactions beyond simple coordination can enhance the overall catalyst structure and activity.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
