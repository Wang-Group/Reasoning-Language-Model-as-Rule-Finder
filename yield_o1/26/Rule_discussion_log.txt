  - **Rationale**: The nitrogen atom in the heterocycle can coordinate with the metal center when the carboxyl group is directly attached, enhancing catalytic properties. Separation by additional rings or linkers diminishes this interaction.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**; modifiers with single hydroxyl groups or ether linkages result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
  
  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  
  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enable multidentate coordination with metal centers, enhancing stability and reactivity. Single hydroxyl groups or ether linkages offer limited coordination capabilities.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (six carbons or more) with **nonpolar side chains** result in **high yield**; introduction of polar groups like hydroxyl or amino leads to **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**
  
  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  
  - **Rationale**: Unsubstituted long-chain acids facilitate hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst matrix, improving stability. Polar substituents introduce steric and electronic effects that can interfere with these interactions.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains result in **high yield**; thiol groups attached to aromatic rings result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  
  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  
  - **Rationale**: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with metal centers due to their flexibility and lack of steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols may experience steric or electronic factors that impede effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in **low yield** due to decreased coordination with metal centers and increased hydrophobicity.**

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  
  - **Rationale**: Fluorination increases electronegativity and hydrophobic character, hindering interaction with the catalyst's active sites and reducing coordination efficiency.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that include ether linkages in aliphatic chains without additional coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
  
  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weaker ligands, and the increased flexibility from ether linkages can reduce the effectiveness of coordination with metal centers.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with carbonyl substituents (aldehyde or ketone groups) on the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions and reduced coordination.**

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  
  - **Rationale**: Carbonyl groups may engage in competing interactions or undergo side reactions, decreasing effective coordination with the catalyst and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination result in **high yield**; those without coordinating heteroatoms result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  
  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
  
  - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in aromatic side chains (e.g., nitrogen in indole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic performance. Aromatic side chains lacking such heteroatoms offer no coordination benefit and may introduce steric hindrance.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups result in **low yield** due to competition for coordination sites and altered geometry.**

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
  
  - **Rationale**: Amide groups can interfere with the carboxylate's ability to coordinate by engaging in hydrogen bonding or altering electronic distribution, reducing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups and additional carbonyl functionalities in the side chain result in **high yield** due to enhanced coordination capabilities.**

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  
  - **Rationale**: Methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, and carbonyl groups in the side chain can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance by providing multiple coordination sites.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers possessing multiple functional groups capable of chelation (such as hydroxyl and carboxylate groups) in proximity result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
  
  - **Rationale**: Chelation through multiple coordinating groups enhances the stability of the metal-ligand complex, improving catalytic activity through stronger and more effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near coordinating groups that may hinder access to coordination sites result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
  
  - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can cause steric hindrance, obstructing effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center and thus decreasing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are cyclic dicarboxylic acids containing multiple carbonyl groups result in **high yield** due to enhanced chelation properties.**

  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
  
  - **Rationale**: Multiple carbonyl groups and ring structures provide several points of coordination, facilitating strong multidentate binding to the metal center and enhancing catalytic performance.

The property insight is sound, linking the presence of lone pair-donating groups to enhanced coordination with metal centers. The rule combines structural features (aromatic carboxylic acid with specific substituents) effectively, covering multiple data points with both high and low yields. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate, making the rule valuable for predictions.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly specifies chain length and coordinating side chains as key factors. The property insight into how chain length and coordinating heteroatoms affect chelation and catalytic activity is well-articulated. The rule considers combinations of structural features, covering several data points across high and low yields. The balance is excellent, as it captures a specific trend without unnecessary complexity.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides a clear structural distinction based on the positioning of the carboxyl group relative to the heterocycle. The property insight regarding coordination through the heterocyclic nitrogen is strong. It combines multiple substructures, and the examples support the rule with both high and low yields. The rule maintains a good balance between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in identifying modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups versus those with single hydroxyls or ether linkages. The property insight effectively explains the role of multidentate coordination in catalytic activity. It considers combinations of functional groups, and although the number of data points is limited, it covers both high and low yield examples. The balance is acceptable, with sufficient complexity to be meaningful.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in its focus on long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with nonpolar side chains. The property insight about hydrophobic interactions enhancing stability adds depth. However, the rule may conflict with Rule 2 regarding chain length, potentially causing confusion. While it covers data points with high and low yields, the balance is somewhat affected by this potential contradiction, which could be clarified for better consistency.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing modifiers. The property insight about steric and electronic factors influencing coordination is well-presented. The rule combines structural features effectively and is supported by data points showing high and low yields. The balance is good, providing valuable guidance without excessive complexity.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in stating that fluorinated alkyl chains lead to low yield due to decreased coordination and increased hydrophobicity. The property insight is reasonable. However, the rule is supported by a single example, limiting its coverage. While the rule is specific and avoids unnecessary complexity, the minimal data support impacts its overall balance and applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly identifies that ether linkages without additional coordinating groups result in low yield. The property insight regarding weaker ligands and increased flexibility is sound. The rule considers structural combinations and is supported by multiple data points. The balance between specificity and coverage is appropriate, enhancing its predictive utility.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear about the negative impact of carbonyl substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids. The property insight about potential side reactions and reduced coordination is strong. It covers relevant data points with low yields, and the complexity is appropriate. The balance is effective, making the rule useful for prediction.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly distinguishes between bulky aromatic side chains with and without coordinating heteroatoms. The property insight into how heteroatoms enhance coordination is well-explained. The rule combines multiple substructures and is supported by data points with contrasting yields. The balance is good, offering clear guidance with sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 provides clarity on how amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups affect yield. The property insight about competition for coordination sites is logical. While the rule covers specific structural features, the number of supporting data points is limited. The balance is acceptable but could be improved with additional examples for stronger coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear but highly specific, focusing on modifiers with methoxy groups and carbonyl functionalities. The property insight about enhanced coordination capabilities is reasonable. However, the rule is supported by a single example, limiting its coverage. The balance between complexity and applicability is somewhat off, suggesting the need for broader support.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear in stating that proximity of multiple chelating groups leads to high yield. The property insight into enhanced stability through chelation is solid. The rule is somewhat general and may overlap with other rules, but it covers key structural features. The balance is acceptable, though additional examples would strengthen its coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly indicates that bulky substituents near coordinating groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance. The property insight is valid. However, the rule is supported by limited data points, affecting coverage. The balance could be improved by incorporating more examples to enhance its significance.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear in identifying cyclic dicarboxylic acids with multiple carbonyl groups as high-yield modifiers. The property insight about enhanced chelation is convincing. Despite its specificity, the rule is only supported by one example, limiting its coverage. The balance between complexity and applicability is not optimal, suggesting the need for more supporting data.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with *sterically hindered functional groups* near coordinating sites result in **low yield** due to reduced coordination efficiency.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing *fluorinated alkyl chains* result in **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability and increased hydrophobicity, which hinders interaction with the metal center.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-methoxybenzoic acid** (if present)

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate and enhance its ability to coordinate with the metal center. Electron-donating groups decrease this ability, reducing catalytic effectiveness.

These rules illustrate how combinations of specific functional groups and structural features within the molecular modifiers influence the yield of the reaction. By focusing on multiple sub-structures—such as chain length, presence of coordinating groups, and steric factors—the rules capture the underlying physical-chemical properties affecting catalytic activity. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity, helping predict whether a given modifier will result in a high or low yield.

The rule provides good physical-chemical insight into how hydrophobic interactions enhance catalyst activity and how polar substituents can hinder this effect. It combines sub-structures by considering both chain length and the presence or absence of polar groups. The coverage is acceptable, supported by multiple data points (e.g., octanoic acid yields high, whereas 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid yields low). The rule strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear and specifies that modifiers with multiple functional groups capable of chelation in close proximity result in high yield, while similar compounds lacking coordinating groups result in low yield. It provides property insight into the importance of chelation. The rule effectively combines sub-structures and is supported by data (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yields high; 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yields low). The balance is appropriate.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly states that modifiers with sterically hindered functional groups near coordinating sites result in low yield. It provides insight into how steric hindrance affects coordination efficiency. The rule considers structural features and is supported by data (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid yields low). The coverage meets the minimum requirement, and the balance is acceptable.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear in stating that modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield. It provides property insight into how fluorination affects coordination and hydrophobicity. However, the rule is only supported by a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid yields low). The coverage is insufficient according to the criteria requiring at least two supporting data points. Therefore, this rule lacks adequate coverage.

It offers property insight into enhanced chelation properties but is only supported by a single data point (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid yields high). The coverage is insufficient, failing to meet the minimum requirement. Hence, the rule lacks adequate data support.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear in stating that modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups result in low yield. It provides property insight into altered electronic properties affecting coordination. The rule is supported by at least two data points (e.g., 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid and (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid yield low). The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** clearly states that modifiers containing ether linkages in aliphatic chains without additional coordinating groups result in low yield. It provides insight into how ether oxygens affect coordination. The rule combines sub-structures and is supported by data (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid yields low). The coverage is acceptable as it meets the minimum data requirement.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** is redundant with Rule 2, both addressing aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents resulting in high yield and electron-donating groups resulting in low yield. While the rule is clear and provides property insight, having two rules covering the same concept adds unnecessary complexity. It would be better to combine this rule with Rule 2 to improve clarity and balance.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** clearly indicates that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone substituents on the aromatic ring result in low yield. It provides property insight into potential side reactions and reduced coordination ability. The rule is supported by data (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid yields low), satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is good.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** specifies that modifiers possessing bulky hydrophobic groups with coordinating substituents result in high yield. While it provides property insight, the rule is only supported by a single data point (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid yields high). The coverage is insufficient according to the criteria, and the rule lacks adequate data support.

  - **Rationale**: The nitrogen atom in the heteroaromatic ring can coordinate with the metal center when the carboxyl group is directly attached, enhancing catalyst activity. When the carboxyl group is separated from the ring, this coordination is hindered, reducing effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing *multiple hydroxyl groups* on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**; modifiers with ether linkages or single hydroxyl groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Ether linkages introduce flexibility and reduce coordination ability due to conformational freedom.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *para-position substituents* that are bulky electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky electron-donating groups can sterically hinder the approach of the modifier to the metal center and reduce the acidity of the carboxyl group, decreasing the efficiency of coordination.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with aromatic side chains* containing heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., indole group in tryptophan) result in **high yield**; those lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in the side chain can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms do not contribute to metal binding, possibly reducing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with *aldehyde or ketone groups* adjacent to the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions and reduced coordination ability.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde and ketone groups can participate in side reactions with the metal catalyst or interfere with binding, leading to decreased catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing *fluorinated alkyl chains* result in **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability and increased hydrophobicity, which hinders interaction with the metal center.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorination increases the electron-withdrawing nature and hydrophobicity, reducing the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal center effectively.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *cyclic dicarboxylic acids* with multiple carbonyl groups (e.g., cyclic anhydrides or lactones) result in **high yield** due to enhanced chelation properties.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple carbonyl groups in a rigid cyclic structure enhance multidentate binding to the metal center, improving catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with *ether linkages* in aliphatic chains and lacking additional strong coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are relatively weak ligands, and the flexibility introduced by ether linkages reduces the effective coordination with the metal center due to entropic factors and unfavorable conformations.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with *bulky or sterically hindered substituents* near coordinating sites result in **low yield** due to reduced coordination efficiency.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Steric hindrance from bulky substituents can impede the approach and binding of the modifier to the metal center, decreasing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers possessing *combinations of coordinating groups* and hydrophobic groups in proximity result in **high yield** due to synergistic enhancement of interactions with the metal center and the hydrophobic environment of the catalyst.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Coordinating groups enhance metal binding while adjacent hydrophobic groups facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst framework, improving overall catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *sulfur-containing aromatic carboxylic acids* result in **low yield** due to possible poisoning of the metal catalyst.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Sulfhydryl groups can strongly bind to metal centers and may deactivate the catalyst by forming stable metal-sulfur bonds.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are *polyfunctional acids* with multiple carboxyl groups in close proximity result in **high yield** due to enhanced chelating ability.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple carboxyl groups can chelate the metal center effectively, leading to stronger binding and better catalytic activity.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic amino acids* or *aminodicarboxylic acids* with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer and side-chain functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl) result in **high yield**; similar longer-chain amino acids or those lacking side-chain functional groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Short-chain amino acids with coordinating side-chain groups are better positioned to chelate metal centers due to proximity and reduced flexibility. This enhances catalyst activity by promoting strong ligand-metal interactions. Longer chains increase flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing coordination efficiency and catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with strongly electron-withdrawing groups capable of coordination (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups or groups that hinder coordination result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and may facilitate stronger coordination with metal centers. They can also participate directly in coordination if they possess lone pairs (e.g., nitro groups). Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and may introduce steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heteroaromatic carboxylic acids* with nitrogen atoms in the ring capable of coordinating to metal centers result in **high yield**; those lacking coordinating heteroatoms or with the carboxyl group disconnected from the heterocycle result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing chelation with metal centers. This dual coordination strengthens metal-ligand interactions, improving catalyst performance. If the carboxyl group is not directly attached to the heterocycle, the potential for such synergistic coordination is diminished.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (six carbons or more) *without polar functional groups* result in **high yield**; introduction of polar groups such as hydroxyl or amino leads to **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Non-polar long-chain acids can enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst framework, potentially stabilizing the active metal center and facilitating substrate access. Polar substituents introduce hydrogen bonding and can disrupt these hydrophobic interactions, possibly leading to catalyst deactivation or reduced activity.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing *multiple hydroxyl groups* on a carbohydrate backbone (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**; modifiers with ether linkages or single hydroxyl groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through multidentate chelation. Ether linkages introduce chain flexibility and are weaker ligands, reducing effective coordination due to entropic factors and less favorable conformations.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with aromatic side chains* containing heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., indole nitrogen in tryptophan) result in **high yield**; those with non-coordinating aromatic side chains result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in the side chain (like the nitrogen in indole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing the overall chelation and stability of the catalyst. Aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms do not contribute additional coordination sites and may not enhance catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing *aldehyde or ketone groups* adjacent to aromatic rings result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions and interference with coordination.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde and ketone groups can undergo side reactions, such as imine formation with amines present in the reaction mixture, reducing the effective concentration of the modifier. Additionally, these groups may interfere with metal coordination by competing for binding sites or altering electronic properties unfavorably.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing *sulfur atoms*, especially *thiol groups* in aromatic systems, result in **low yield** due to potential poisoning of the metal catalyst.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Sulfur-containing groups, particularly thiols, have a high affinity for metal centers and can bind irreversibly, deactivating the catalyst by forming stable metal-sulfur bonds. This diminishes the availability of active sites necessary for the desired catalytic reaction.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with *fluorinated alkyl chains* result in **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability and increased hydrophobicity, which can hinder interaction with the metal center.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorination enhances the electron-withdrawing nature of the alkyl chain, reducing the electron density on potential coordinating atoms. This weakens ligand-metal interactions. Additionally, highly fluorinated chains are exceptionally hydrophobic, which may impede effective integration into a mostly organic catalyst framework.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *bulky electron-donating groups* at the *para-position* (e.g., methyl, methoxy) result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky electron-donating substituents can sterically hinder the approach of the modifier to the metal center and decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, making metal coordination less favorable. This reduces the effectiveness of the modifier in enhancing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with *ether linkages* in aliphatic chains and lacking additional strong coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are relatively weak ligands, and the flexibility introduced by ether linkages leads to entropic disadvantages in forming stable metal-ligand complexes. Without stronger coordinating groups to compensate, these modifiers are less effective in enhancing catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *cyclic compounds with multiple carbonyl groups* capable of chelation (e.g., cyclic anhydrides or lactones) result in **high yield** due to enhanced multidentate coordination.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Rigid cyclic structures with multiple carbonyl groups can act as chelating ligands, forming strong and stable complexes with metal centers. This multidentate binding enhances catalyst stability and activity by firmly anchoring the metal within the catalyst framework.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers combining *ketone functional groups* with neighboring carboxylic acids in aliphatic chains result in **low yield** due to potential interference with coordination and increased chain flexibility.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The presence of ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids may form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or interact unfavorably with the metal center, reducing effective coordination. The increased flexibility of the aliphatic chain can also decrease the likelihood of simultaneous coordination of both functional groups.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids* (with 4 to 5 carbons) containing an additional *amino group* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The presence of two carboxyl groups and an amino group provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions. This multidentate binding enhances the stability and activity of the catalyst by forming strong chelation complexes with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with *electron-withdrawing groups* capable of coordination (e.g., *amino*, *nitro*, *bromomethyl*) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and can participate in coordination with metal ions. The para-substitution ensures optimal positioning for interaction with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance through improved metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heteroaromatic carboxylic acids* with nitrogen atoms in the ring capable of coordination result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen heterocycles can donate lone pairs to metal centers, acting as effective ligands. The aromatic ring provides stability, while the nitrogen atom enhances coordination, resulting in a more active and stable catalyst.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with multiple *hydroxyl groups* (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups offer several coordination sites for metal binding. This multidentate interaction increases the stability of the metal complex and enhances catalytic activity by facilitating stronger and more numerous metal-ligand bonds.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with a *terminal thiol group* on a short chain (3 carbons) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The thiol group can form strong bonds with metal ions, and in short-chain acids, steric hindrance is minimized. This facilitates effective coordination without deactivating the catalyst, thus enhancing yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *simple aliphatic carboxylic acids* with a carbon chain length of up to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Simple aliphatic acids can effectively interact with metal centers without steric hindrance or interference from additional functional groups. The optimal chain length allows for sufficient interaction while maintaining the catalyst's activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with coordinating side chains* containing *heteroatoms* (e.g., indole nitrogen in tryptophan) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Side chains with heteroatoms can provide additional coordination sites. The indole ring's nitrogen atom can coordinate with metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through multidentate binding.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with *electron-donating groups* (e.g., *methyl*, *methoxy*, *hydroxyl*) result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group and do not offer additional coordination sites. This results in weaker metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *para-substituted thiol groups* result in **low yield** due to catalyst poisoning through strong metal-sulfur bonds.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic thiol groups can bind irreversibly to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst. The strong metal-sulfur interaction can block active sites and inhibit catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *aldehyde groups* (e.g., formyl groups) result in **low yield** due to side reactions and interference with coordination.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can undergo side reactions, such as condensation or reduction, interfering with the catalyst. They may also compete with the carboxyl group for metal coordination, leading to a less effective catalyst.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (more than 6 carbons) with *terminal amino or hydroxyl groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Longer aliphatic chains increase molecular flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of coordination between functional groups and the metal center. This leads to weaker metal-ligand interactions and decreased catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with non-coordinating aromatic side chains* (e.g., *phenylalanine*) result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms do not enhance metal binding. The absence of additional coordination sites means the modifier cannot effectively stabilize the metal center, resulting in lower catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are *carboxylic acids with long ethylene glycol chains* result in **low yield** due to weak coordination and entropic penalties.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are poor ligands, and the flexibility introduced by long ethylene glycol chains increases the entropic cost of binding. This results in weak metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density hindering coordination.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen atoms, weakening their ability to coordinate with metal ions. This leads to less effective catalyst modification and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with *bulky or sterically hindered functional groups* that impede effective coordination result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky substituents can hinder the approach of functional groups to the metal center, reducing coordination efficiency. Steric hindrance can prevent optimal metal-ligand interactions, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic dicarboxylic acids* with an additional *amino group* on the alpha carbon result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an amino group allows for tridentate coordination with metal centers. This multidentate binding enhances the stability and activity of the catalyst by forming strong complexes with the metal ion, facilitating efficient electron transfer during the reaction.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with an *amino* or *nitro* group result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Amino and nitro groups can coordinate with metal centers or influence the electronic properties of the aromatic ring. The para-substitution positions these groups optimally for interaction, enhancing metal-ligand coordination, and increasing the acidity of the carboxyl group, which strengthens binding to the metal ion.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heterocyclic carboxylic acids* containing *nitrogen atoms* in the ring capable of coordination result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as electron donors, coordinating with metal centers. This coordination enhances the electron density at the metal ion, improving catalytic activity. The rigidity of the heterocycle also contributes to the stability of the metal-ligand complex.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with multiple *hydroxyl groups* (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding. This multidentate interaction increases the strength and stability of the metal complex, enhancing catalytic efficiency by facilitating effective electron transfer processes.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* with a *thiol group* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Thiol groups have a high affinity for metal ions, forming strong metal-sulfur bonds. In short-chain acids, the minimal steric hindrance allows the thiol and carboxyl groups to coordinate simultaneously with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *simple aliphatic carboxylic acids* with chain lengths up to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: These acids can effectively coordinate with metal centers through their carboxyl group without interference from other functional groups. The optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, maintaining catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted with *aldehyde groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can undergo side reactions, such as condensation or oxidation, which may deactivate the catalyst. They can also interfere with metal coordination by competing with the carboxyl group, reducing effective metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *para-substituted methyl or methoxy groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups like methyl and methoxy decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. They do not provide additional coordination sites, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (more than 6 carbons) with *terminal amino or hydroxyl groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Long aliphatic chains increase flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination of functional groups to the metal center. This results in weaker metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorine's strong electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate group, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal ions. The resultant weak metal-ligand interactions lead to poor catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *thiol groups* on the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to catalyst poisoning.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic thiol groups can form very strong bonds with metal centers, potentially leading to irreversible binding that deactivates the catalyst by blocking active sites needed for the reaction.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with long *polyether chains* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The ether oxygen atoms have lone pairs but are poor ligands due to the electron-withdrawing effect of adjacent oxygen atoms. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains hinder effective coordination with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with *non-coordinating side chains*, such as a *phenyl group*, result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms do not contribute to metal binding. The phenyl group is hydrophobic and does not facilitate additional interactions with the metal center, resulting in weaker overall coordination.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with side chains containing *thioether groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Thioether sulfur atoms are less effective at coordinating with metal ions compared to thiol sulfur. Additionally, the bulkiness of the thioether side chain can introduce steric hindrance, reducing effective metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are *dicarboxylic acids* with *keto groups* in the chain result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ketone groups can participate in keto-enol tautomerism and may interfere with metal coordination by engaging in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or forming enolates. This reduces the availability of coordination sites for the metal ion.

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *α-amino dicarboxylic acids* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The presence of an amino group at the α-carbon and two carboxylate groups allows for multiple coordination points with the metal center. This multidentate binding enhances catalyst stability and activity by forming strong complexes, facilitating efficient electron transfer during the reaction.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids* with an *amino* or *nitro* group result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Amino and nitro groups at the para position influence the electronic properties of the aromatic ring and increase the acidity of the carboxyl group. This enhances metal-ligand coordination by strengthening the binding to the metal ion. Additionally, these substituents can participate in coordination with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heterocyclic carboxylic acids* containing *nitrogen atoms* capable of coordinating to metals result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as electron donors and coordinate with metal centers. This coordination increases the electron density at the metal ion and enhances the stability of the catalyst through chelation, improving catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with multiple *hydroxyl groups* (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding. This multidentate interaction strengthens the metal-ligand complex, enhancing catalyst performance by facilitating effective electron transfer processes.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* with a *thiol group* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Thiol groups have a high affinity for metal ions, forming strong metal-sulfur bonds. In short-chain acids, the minimal steric hindrance allows the thiol and carboxyl groups to coordinate simultaneously with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* without additional functional groups and chain lengths up to 8 carbons result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: These acids can effectively coordinate with metal centers through their carboxyl group without interference from other functional groups. The optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, maintaining catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted with *aldehyde* (formyl) groups on the aromatic ring result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can undergo side reactions, such as condensation or oxidation, which may deactivate the catalyst. They can also interfere with metal coordination by competing with the carboxyl group, reducing effective metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-donating methyl or methoxy groups* at the *para position* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups like methyl and methoxy decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. They do not provide additional coordination sites, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (more than 6 carbons) with terminal *amino* or *hydroxyl* groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Long aliphatic chains increase flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination of functional groups to the metal center. This results in weaker metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *thiol groups* on the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to catalyst poisoning.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic thiol groups can form very strong bonds with metal centers, potentially leading to irreversible binding that deactivates the catalyst by blocking active sites needed for the reaction.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with long *polyether chains* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The ether oxygen atoms have lone pairs but are poor ligands due to resonance delocalization and the electron-withdrawing effect of adjacent oxygen atoms. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains hinder effective coordination with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorine's strong electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate group, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal ions. The resultant weak metal-ligand interactions lead to poor catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with *non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains*, such as a *phenyl* or *thioether* group, result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms do not contribute to metal binding. Hydrophobic groups like phenyl and thioether do not facilitate additional interactions with the metal center and may introduce steric hindrance, resulting in weaker overall coordination.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *dicarboxylic acids* with *keto groups* in the chain result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ketone groups can participate in keto-enol tautomerism and may interfere with metal coordination by engaging in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or forming enolates. This reduces the availability of coordination sites for the metal ion and may lead to side reactions.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are *strong chelating agents* forming *insoluble complexes* with the metal center result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Strong chelating ligands can sequester the metal ion, forming inactive species or precipitates. This depletes the amount of active catalyst available for the reaction, resulting in lower yields.

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as coordination sites, binding to metal centers and increasing electron density at the metal ion. This enhances catalyst stability and reactivity through effective metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with additional coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, mercapto) within three carbons of the carboxyl group result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Additional coordinating groups close to the carboxyl enhance chelation with the metal center, forming stable five- or six-membered chelate rings. This improves the efficiency of electron transfer processes and catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-donating groups* (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the *para position* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its coordination ability with metal ions. They do not provide additional coordination sites and can reduce the effectiveness of metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *aldehyde groups* on the aromatic ring result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or interfere with metal coordination by forming complexes that are less active or inactive, thus reducing catalyst efficiency.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Strongly electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease the electron density on the carboxylate group, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. This results in poor metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* with no additional functional groups and chain lengths up to eight carbons result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: These acids can effectively coordinate with metal centers through their carboxyl group without steric hindrance. The optimal chain length maintains a balance between hydrophobic interactions and solubility, supporting catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (more than six carbons) with terminal *amino* or *hydroxy* groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The increased chain length and terminal positioning of functional groups lead to flexibility and reduced effectiveness in chelation. The coordinating groups are too distant from the carboxyl group to form stable chelate rings, weakening metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with *hydrophobic side chains* lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that contain *polyether chains* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Polyether chains introduce steric bulk and flexibility, hindering effective coordination with the metal center. The ether oxygen atoms are poor ligands due to delocalization of lone pair electrons and do not contribute significantly to metal binding.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *thiol groups* on the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to catalyst poisoning.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic thiol groups can form very strong, sometimes irreversible bonds with metal centers, blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with side chains containing *coordinating heteroatoms* integrated into *aromatic heterocycles* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic heterocycles with heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring) can coordinate to metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through additional metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with substituents capable of *chelation via keto and hydroxyl groups* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, strengthening its ability to coordinate with metal ions and enhancing catalytic activity through improved electron acceptance.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, forming strong complexes with metal centers and enhancing electron density at the metal ion, which improves catalytic reactivity.

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Counterexample (High Yield)**:

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Hydrophobic side chains without heteroatoms do not offer additional coordination sites, leading to weaker metal-ligand interactions and less effective catalysis.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl groups result in **variable yield**, influenced by their ability to form chelating rings with metal centers.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

These rules illustrate the relationships between structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By combining multiple substructures and considering physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, and steric factors, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in high or low yield.

**Summary of Key Insights:**

- **Coordination Enhancement**: Modifiers with multiple coordinating groups in close proximity (e.g., carboxylate, amino, hydroxyl, heterocyclic nitrogen) enhance metal-ligand interactions, leading to higher yields due to stronger and more stable catalyst complexes.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase carboxylate acidity and coordination strength, improving yield. Electron-donating groups can decrease coordination ability unless compensated by additional coordinating sites.

- **Steric and Structural Factors**: Modifiers with bulky substituents or flexible chains near coordinating groups hinder effective coordination, resulting in lower yields. The overall molecular geometry influences the ability to form stable chelates with the metal center.

- **Functional Group Interference**: Certain functional groups like aldehydes, perfluoroalkyl chains, or aromatic thiols may interfere with metal coordination or deactivate the catalyst, leading to low yields.

- **Position of Functional Groups**: The location of coordinating or interfering functional groups (e.g., sulfur atoms, hydroxyl groups) within the molecule affects their impact on the yield.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the potential effectiveness of new modifiers and inform the selection or design of molecular modifiers to optimize and control the reaction yield based on their structural characteristics.

**End of Rules**

These rules capture the relationships between specific structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering combinations of functional groups and underlying physicochemical properties, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in high or low yield:

- **Coordination Enhancement**: Modifiers with multiple or strong coordinating groups (e.g., carboxylate, amino, heterocyclic nitrogen or sulfur atoms) increase coordination with metal centers, leading to higher yields.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of carboxylate groups, improving catalyst performance. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect, reducing yield.

- **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents or flexible chains near coordinating groups can hinder effective metal-ligand interactions, resulting in lower yields due to decreased coordination efficiency.

- **Functional Group Interference**: Functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, or perfluoroalkyl chains can interfere with metal coordination or alter electronic properties, leading to lower yields.

- **Hydrophobicity and Coordination Sites**: Modifiers lacking coordinating heteroatoms in their side chains or those with remote functional groups generally result in lower yields due to weaker metal interactions or steric hindrance.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the potential effectiveness of new modifiers based on their structural characteristics. This enables the selection or design of molecular modifiers to optimize and control the reaction yield, facilitating more efficient catalyst development.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  Rule 1 is **clear**, allowing for straightforward determination of high yield modifiers based on the presence of both an amino group and at least one carboxylic acid group attached to an aliphatic chain of up to 6 carbons. The **property insight** is adequate, explaining how multiple coordination sites enhance catalyst efficiency through strong chelation. The rule considers a **combination of sub-structures** (amino group and carboxylate on a short aliphatic chain), satisfying the **complexity** criterion. With at least **four supporting data points** (entries 0, 2, 3, 15) showing high yield, the **coverage** is strong. Overall, Rule 1 effectively meets all criteria.

- **Comment 2**:

  Rule 2 is **clear** in specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in high yield. The **property insight** about increased acidity enhancing coordination is sound. The rule combines an aromatic ring, carboxylate group, and specific substituents, meeting the **complexity** requirement. However, the **coverage** is limited to **two data points** (entries 1 and 21). Additionally, the presence of 4-formylbenzoic acid (entry 20) with a low yield suggests a potential **contradiction**, as the formyl group is electron-withdrawing. This indicates that the rule may need refinement to account for exceptions and improve its applicability.

- **Comment 3**:

  Rule 3 provides **clarity** by indicating that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position result in low yield. The **property insight** regarding decreased acidity and weakened coordination is appropriate. The rule considers both the aromatic structure and substituent effects, fulfilling the **complexity** criterion. It is supported by at least **two data points** (entries 23 and 30) showing low yield. However, entry 7 (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) shows a **high yield**, which contradicts the rule despite having a para-hydroxy group. This suggests that the **coverage** may not fully capture all relevant cases, and the rule may require adjustments to address such exceptions.

- **Comment 4**:

  Rule 4 is **clear**, stating that heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring result in high yield. The **property insight** about nitrogen atoms enhancing coordination is relevant. The rule combines heterocyclic structures with functional groups, satisfying **complexity**. It is supported by **two data points** (entries 16 and 22) showing high yield. However, entry 12 (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) has a **low yield**, which may be a contradiction if it fits the structural description of the rule. This indicates that the **coverage** may be insufficient, and the rule might need refinement to improve its predictive accuracy.

- **Comment 5**:

  Rule 5 offers **clarity** by specifying that amino acids with side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in low yield. The **property insight** regarding weaker coordination due to lack of coordinating groups is sound. The rule focuses on side chain properties, demonstrating **complexity**. It is supported by **multiple data points** (entries 13 and 33) showing low yield, indicating good **coverage**. There are no apparent contradictions, so Rule 5 effectively meets all criteria.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 is **clear** in stating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group result in high yield. The **property insight** about thiol groups forming strong bonds with metal ions is valid. The rule combines functional groups, meeting **complexity**. However, it is supported by only **one data point** (entry 18), which limits its **coverage**. To strengthen the rule, additional supporting data would be beneficial.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 maintains **clarity** by indicating that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in low yield. The **property insight** concerning functional group interference is appropriate. The rule considers the positioning of functional groups, fulfilling **complexity**. It is supported by **two data points** (entries 20 and 27) with low yield, demonstrating adequate **coverage**. Rule 7 meets the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 8**:

  Rule 8 is **clear**, stating that perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in low yield. The **property insight** about electron-withdrawing effects reducing coordination ability is relevant. The rule is relatively simple and may lack **complexity** in terms of combining sub-structures. It is supported by only **one data point** (entry 14), so the **coverage** is limited. Additional examples would enhance the robustness of the rule.

- **Comment 9**:

  Rule 9 provides **clarity** by specifying that polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in high yield. The **property insight** about multiple hydroxyl groups enhancing coordination is sound. The rule considers multiple functional groups, meeting **complexity**. However, with only **one supporting data point** (entry 9), the **coverage** is insufficient. More data are needed to validate this rule fully.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 is **clear** in stating that modifiers with remote amino or hydroxyl groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance. The **property insight** is appropriate. The rule considers the spatial arrangement of functional groups, satisfying **complexity**. It is supported by **multiple data points** (entries 29, 31, 34) showing low yield, indicating strong **coverage**. Rule 10 meets all the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 11**:

These rules demonstrate how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction:

- **High Yield Modifiers**: Contain functional groups capable of effective metal coordination (e.g., amino acids with coordinating side chains, heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen atoms, proximal thiol or hydroxyl groups). These features enhance metal-ligand interactions, leading to improved catalyst performance.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**: Lack coordinating groups, have functional groups that are too distant or hinder coordination (e.g., bulky substituents, distal amino or hydroxyl groups), or contain interfering functional groups (e.g., aldehydes, ketones, perfluoroalkyl chains). These factors weaken metal-ligand interactions or introduce steric and electronic effects that reduce catalytic efficiency.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield and can design new modifiers to optimize the reaction outcome based on their structural characteristics.

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* is clear and allows for straightforward identification of high yield modifiers based on the presence of a carboxylic acid group with additional coordinating amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups within three atoms from the carboxyl group. The rule provides strong physical-chemical insight, emphasizing the enhancement of metal-ligand interactions due to nearby coordinating groups. It considers combinations of substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. With multiple supporting data points (e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid, gluconic acid), it has excellent coverage. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* aims to classify high yield modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups capable of coordinating with metals, such as amino and nitro groups. However, the inclusion of amino groups as electron-withdrawing is chemically inaccurate, as amino groups are electron-donating and decrease carboxylate acidity. This inconsistency affects the clarity and the physical-chemical insight of the rule. While it considers combinations of substructures and is supported by two data points (4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid), the misclassification of amino groups suggests the rule needs refinement for better accuracy.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* is clear in identifying high yield modifiers as heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination. The physical-chemical insight is solid, highlighting the role of nitrogen in strengthening metal-ligand interactions. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is well-supported by data points (e.g., nicotinic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. It strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* effectively identifies high yield modifiers as those with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group. The rule is clear and provides strong physical-chemical insight by explaining how additional coordination sites enhance metal binding. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., gluconic acid), ensuring good coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* is clear, specifying high yield modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted bromomethyl groups. The physical-chemical rationale is acceptable. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), which does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two supporting examples. This limits the rule's reliability and suggests a need for additional data or integration into a broader rule for better coverage.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* clearly identifies high yield modifiers as medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups. The rationale is satisfactory, citing optimal catalyst interaction without steric hindrance. However, only one data point (octanoic acid) supports the rule, failing the coverage criterion. The simplicity of the rule is balanced, but additional supporting examples are necessary to strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* clearly classifies low yield modifiers as aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, explaining the reduced effectiveness of distant functional groups in metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), fulfilling the coverage requirement and maintaining a good balance.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* effectively identifies low yield modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups. The rule is clear and provides solid physical-chemical insight into how electron-donating groups decrease carboxylate acidity. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* clearly identifies low yield modifiers containing carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group. The physical-chemical rationale is sound, discussing competition for metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is well-supported by data points (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid), meeting the coverage criterion and maintaining a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* is clear in identifying low yield modifiers as perfluorinated carboxylic acids. The physical-chemical rationale is acceptable. However, with only one supporting data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), it fails the coverage criterion. The specificity of the rule and lack of additional examples limit its applicability, suggesting a need for more data for validation.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* effectively classifies low yield modifiers with bulky substituents or flexible polyether chains near the carboxyl group. The rule is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight into steric hindrance effects. It considers combinations of structural features and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), satisfying the coverage requirement and maintaining a good balance.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* clearly identifies low yield modifiers as amino acids with hydrophobic or non-coordinating side chains. The physical-chemical rationale is adequate, explaining the lack of additional coordinating groups. The rule considers combinations of substructures and meets the coverage criterion with supporting data points (e.g., phenylalanine), maintaining a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* is clear in specifying low yield modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted thiol groups. While the physical-chemical insight is acceptable, only one data point (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid) supports the rule, failing the coverage criterion. The rule's specificity and limited data support suggest that additional examples are needed to strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* identifies high yield modifiers with multiple methoxy groups on an aromatic ring and an additional ketone group. The rule is specific and provides some physical-chemical insight into synergistic effects. However, it is supported by only one data point (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), which does not meet the coverage criterion. Additional supporting data are necessary for this rule to be reliable.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* broadly states that modifiers containing both electron-withdrawing groups and coordinating functional groups result in a high yield. The rule lacks clarity due to its generality, and while the physical-chemical rationale is acceptable, it is only supported by one data point (4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), failing the coverage criterion. The rule would benefit from refinement and additional examples to enhance its clarity and coverage.

  - **Rule 11** specifies that modifiers with adjacent carbonyl groups to the carboxyl group result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, explaining potential competition for metal coordination. The rule combines multiple sub-structures (carboxylate and adjacent carbonyl groups), satisfying complexity. It is supported by at least two examples in the dataset (4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), indicating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 12**:
  - **Rule 12** is clear in identifying perfluorinated carboxylic acids as low-yield modifiers. The physical-chemical insight adequately explains how strong electron-withdrawing effects weaken metal coordination. While the rule focuses on a specific functional group, it meets the complexity criterion due to the significant structural modification. With at least one supporting example in the dataset (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), coverage is limited, and additional data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 13**:
  - **Rule 13** clearly states that amino acids with non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight is sufficient, noting the lack of additional coordination sites. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (amino acids with specific side chains), meeting the complexity requirement. Supported by at least one example (phenylalanine) in the dataset, coverage could be improved with more data points.

- **Comment 14**:
  - **Rule 14** specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted thiol groups result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight discusses steric constraints and potential oxidation of thiol groups. The rule combines sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylate, para-thiol substituent), satisfying complexity. With one supporting example (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid) in the dataset, coverage is limited, and additional data would enhance the rule.

- **Comment 15**:
  - **Rule 15** clearly states that modifiers with multiple coordinating groups capable of forming stable chelates result in high yield.

  - **Rule 8** clearly indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups result in low yield. The property insight is solid, explaining decreased acidity and weakened metal coordination. The rule combines specific structural elements, adding complexity. Supported by entries 23 and 30, it satisfies the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and data support is well-managed.

- **Comment 9**:
  - **Rule 9** clearly asserts that aliphatic carboxylic acids with distant functional groups (more than three carbons away) result in low yield. The property insight about reduced coordination effectiveness is logical. The rule's complexity is appropriate, considering the spatial arrangement of functional groups. Supported by entries 29, 31, and 34, it meets the coverage criterion. The balance between specificity and applicability is effective.

- **Comment 10**:
  - **Rule 10** is clear in stating that bulky or flexible polar substituents near the carboxyl group lead to low yield. The property insight about steric hindrance is valid.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are amino acids with an amino group near the carboxyl group result in a high yield, especially when the amino group is on the alpha or beta carbon.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Amino groups located near the carboxylate allow for chelation, forming bidentate coordination with the metal center. This enhances catalytic activity by stabilizing the metal and facilitating electron transfer.

---

2. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups at the para position result in a high yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal. Coordinating groups like amino or halogens can further stabilize the metal center through additional interactions.

---

3. **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination result in a high yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites for the metal, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing electron transfer processes essential for high catalytic activity.

---

4. **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxyl group result in a high yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Polyol groups can chelate the metal center through multiple hydroxyl interactions, enhancing stability and reactivity of the catalyst.

---

5. **Modifiers containing a thiol group (–SH) adjacent to the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in a high yield; however, thiol groups attached to an aromatic ring result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: In aliphatic compounds, thiol groups near the carboxylate strongly coordinate with metals due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur, enhancing catalytic activity. In aromatic compounds, the thiol group's lone pair can delocalize into the ring, reducing its availability for metal coordination.

---

6. **Modifiers that are medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 to 8 carbons) without bulky substituents result in a high yield.**

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **Octanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: The optimal chain length improves hydrophobic interactions without causing steric hindrance, facilitating effective interaction with the catalyst's active site.

---

7. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups, such as methyl (–CH₃) or methoxy (–OCH₃), result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal center, thus reducing catalytic efficiency.

---

8. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located on distant carbons (more than three carbon atoms away from the carboxyl group) result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with the metal center due to increased flexibility and distance, resulting in lower catalytic activity.

---

9. **Modifiers with flexible, bulky, or heavily substituted side chains near the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Bulky and flexible substituents can create steric hindrance, preventing the carboxyl group from effectively coordinating with the metal center and thus diminishing catalytic performance.

---

10. **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can either compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or form intramolecular interactions that disrupt optimal binding to the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.

---

11. **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in a low yield.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: The presence of highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduces the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal center and decreasing catalytic activity.

---

12. **Modifiers that are amino acids with non-coordinating hydrophobic or aromatic side chains result in a low yield.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

    - **Rationale**: Side chains lacking additional coordinating functional groups provide minimal interaction with the metal center, leading to weaker catalyst-modifier binding and lower yields.

---

13. **Modifiers containing amide linkages or peptide bonds near the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Amide groups can compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, interfering with effective binding to the metal center and diminishing catalytic efficiency.

---

14. **Modifiers with highly conjugated aromatic systems or multiple electron-donating substituents result in a low yield.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Extensive conjugation and electron-donating groups delocalize electron density, reducing the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, and thus decreasing the overall yield.

---

15. **Modifiers combining electron-withdrawing groups with additional coordinating functional groups result in a high yield.**

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group, while additional coordinating functional groups facilitate stronger metal binding, synergistically improving catalytic activity.

These rules establish a relationship between specific combinations of functional groups in molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction:

- **High Yield Modifiers** often contain:

  - **Proximal amino groups** near the carboxylate for bidentate coordination (Rule 1).
  - **Aromatic rings** with electron-withdrawing or coordinating para-substituents (Rule 2).
  - **Heterocycles with nitrogen atoms** that serve as additional coordination sites (Rule 3).
  - **Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups** enabling chelation (Rule 4).
  - **Aliphatic thiol groups** adjacent to the carboxylate enhancing metal coordination (Rule 5).
  - **Optimal chain lengths** without bulky substituents for better interaction with the catalyst (Rule 6).
  - **Combinations of electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups** to enhance metal binding (Rule 15).

- **Low Yield Modifiers** typically have:

  - **Electron-donating groups** that reduce carboxylate acidity (Rule 7).
  - **Functional groups distant from the carboxylate**, limiting coordination (Rule 8).
  - **Bulky or flexible substituents** causing steric hindrance (Rule 9).
  - **Adjacent carbonyl groups** competing for metal coordination (Rule 10).
  - **Perfluorination** reducing electron density on the carboxylate (Rule 11).
  - **Non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains** in amino acids (Rule 12).
  - **Amide linkages or peptide bonds** near the carboxylate disrupting coordination (Rule 13).
  - **Highly conjugated systems or multiple electron-donating groups** decreasing carboxylate acidity and coordination (Rule 14).
  - **Aromatic thiol groups** less available for coordination due to delocalization or oxidation (Rule 5, Low Yield example).

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. This aids in the selection or design of modifiers to optimize the catalytic performance of the Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe) system in the target reaction.
