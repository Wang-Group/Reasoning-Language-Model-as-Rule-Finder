**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (3 to 6 carbons) with additional *strong coordinating groups* such as *amino*, *carboxyl*, or *thiol groups* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Short-chain aliphatic acids with additional coordinating functional groups enhance metal-ligand interactions through effective chelation, improving catalyst activity and stability.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with *electron-withdrawing groups* capable of coordination (e.g., *amino*, *nitro*, *bromomethyl*) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and introduce additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heteroaromatic carboxylic acids* with *nitrogen atoms in the ring* capable of coordination result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen heterocycles serve as effective ligands, donating electron density to metal centers and stabilizing the catalyst through strong coordination.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *polyhydroxy carboxylic acids* result in **high yield** due to multiple coordination sites.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several chelation points, enhancing metal binding and improving catalyst efficiency through multidentate coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted with *aldehyde or ketone groups* result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions and interference with coordination.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde and ketone groups can undergo side reactions or compete with the carboxyl group for metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in **low yield** due to poor coordination ability.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions and diminishing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with non-coordinating aromatic side chains* (e.g., *phenylalanine*) result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms do not enhance metal binding, leading to less effective catalyst modification and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (more than six carbons) with *terminal amino or hydroxyl groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Longer aliphatic chains increase flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency and weakening metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with *electron-donating groups* (e.g., *methyl groups*) result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group and do not provide additional coordination sites, leading to weaker metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with *aromatic thiol groups* result in **low yield** due to catalyst poisoning.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic thiol groups can bind irreversibly to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst through strong metal-sulfur bonds and inhibiting catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with *ether linkages* and lacking strong coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weak ligands, and the flexibility introduced by ether linkages reduces effective coordination due to entropic factors, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with aromatic side chains* containing *coordinating heteroatoms* (e.g., the indole nitrogen in *tryptophan*) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in the side chain can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing ligand-metal interactions and improving catalyst activity through additional binding sites.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with *complex or bulky structures* that may interfere with coordination or cause steric hindrance result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky substituents and complex structures may hinder effective coordination with metal centers, reducing catalyst performance due to steric effects.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *hydroxyl groups* on the aromatic ring result in variable yield depending on *chain length* and *positioning* of the hydroxyl group.**

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The distance between the carboxyl group and the aromatic ring influences coordination efficiency; longer linkers may facilitate better interaction with the metal center, enhancing yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are *simple aliphatic carboxylic acids* without additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Simple aliphatic acids may provide optimal spacing and minimal steric hindrance, allowing effective coordination with the metal center and promoting catalytic activity.

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the resulting yield of the reaction. Each rule combines multiple functional group features and considers underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, and steric factors.

By following these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural characteristics. The rules prioritize broad coverage of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity, providing clear guidance for selecting or designing modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------
