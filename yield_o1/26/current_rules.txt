**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are amino acids with an amino group near the carboxyl group result in a high yield, especially when the amino group is on the alpha or beta carbon.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Amino groups located near the carboxylate allow for chelation, forming bidentate coordination with the metal center. This enhances catalytic activity by stabilizing the metal and facilitating electron transfer.

---

2. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups at the para position result in a high yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal. Coordinating groups like amino or halogens can further stabilize the metal center through additional interactions.

---

3. **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination result in a high yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites for the metal, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing electron transfer processes essential for high catalytic activity.

---

4. **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxyl group result in a high yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Polyol groups can chelate the metal center through multiple hydroxyl interactions, enhancing stability and reactivity of the catalyst.

---

5. **Modifiers containing a thiol group (–SH) adjacent to the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in a high yield; however, thiol groups attached to an aromatic ring result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: In aliphatic compounds, thiol groups near the carboxylate strongly coordinate with metals due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur, enhancing catalytic activity. In aromatic compounds, the thiol group's lone pair can delocalize into the ring, reducing its availability for metal coordination.

---

6. **Modifiers that are medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 to 8 carbons) without bulky substituents result in a high yield.**

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **Octanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: The optimal chain length improves hydrophobic interactions without causing steric hindrance, facilitating effective interaction with the catalyst's active site.

---

7. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups, such as methyl (–CH₃) or methoxy (–OCH₃), result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal center, thus reducing catalytic efficiency.

---

8. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located on distant carbons (more than three carbon atoms away from the carboxyl group) result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with the metal center due to increased flexibility and distance, resulting in lower catalytic activity.

---

9. **Modifiers with flexible, bulky, or heavily substituted side chains near the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Bulky and flexible substituents can create steric hindrance, preventing the carboxyl group from effectively coordinating with the metal center and thus diminishing catalytic performance.

---

10. **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can either compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or form intramolecular interactions that disrupt optimal binding to the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.

---

11. **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in a low yield.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: The presence of highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduces the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal center and decreasing catalytic activity.

---

12. **Modifiers that are amino acids with non-coordinating hydrophobic or aromatic side chains result in a low yield.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

    - **Rationale**: Side chains lacking additional coordinating functional groups provide minimal interaction with the metal center, leading to weaker catalyst-modifier binding and lower yields.

---

13. **Modifiers containing amide linkages or peptide bonds near the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Amide groups can compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, interfering with effective binding to the metal center and diminishing catalytic efficiency.

---

14. **Modifiers with highly conjugated aromatic systems or multiple electron-donating substituents result in a low yield.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Extensive conjugation and electron-donating groups delocalize electron density, reducing the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, and thus decreasing the overall yield.

---

15. **Modifiers combining electron-withdrawing groups with additional coordinating functional groups result in a high yield.**

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group, while additional coordinating functional groups facilitate stronger metal binding, synergistically improving catalytic activity.

**End of Rules**

These rules establish a relationship between specific combinations of functional groups in molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction:

- **High Yield Modifiers** often contain:

  - **Proximal amino groups** near the carboxylate for bidentate coordination (Rule 1).
  - **Aromatic rings** with electron-withdrawing or coordinating para-substituents (Rule 2).
  - **Heterocycles with nitrogen atoms** that serve as additional coordination sites (Rule 3).
  - **Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups** enabling chelation (Rule 4).
  - **Aliphatic thiol groups** adjacent to the carboxylate enhancing metal coordination (Rule 5).
  - **Optimal chain lengths** without bulky substituents for better interaction with the catalyst (Rule 6).
  - **Combinations of electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups** to enhance metal binding (Rule 15).

- **Low Yield Modifiers** typically have:

  - **Electron-donating groups** that reduce carboxylate acidity (Rule 7).
  - **Functional groups distant from the carboxylate**, limiting coordination (Rule 8).
  - **Bulky or flexible substituents** causing steric hindrance (Rule 9).
  - **Adjacent carbonyl groups** competing for metal coordination (Rule 10).
  - **Perfluorination** reducing electron density on the carboxylate (Rule 11).
  - **Non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains** in amino acids (Rule 12).
  - **Amide linkages or peptide bonds** near the carboxylate disrupting coordination (Rule 13).
  - **Highly conjugated systems or multiple electron-donating groups** decreasing carboxylate acidity and coordination (Rule 14).
  - **Aromatic thiol groups** less available for coordination due to delocalization or oxidation (Rule 5, Low Yield example).

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. This aids in the selection or design of modifiers to optimize the catalytic performance of the Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe) system in the target reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
