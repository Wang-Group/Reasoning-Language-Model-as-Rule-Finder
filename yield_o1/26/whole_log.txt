**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with a carbon chain length of five or fewer carbons, containing both a free amino group and a carboxylic acid group, result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid  
  Rationale: Short-chain amino acids can effectively coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst due to the presence of amino and carboxylate groups, enhancing catalysis.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with functional groups capable of metal coordination, such as amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups, result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid  
  Rationale: Para-substituted groups that can interact with metal centers enhance catalyst performance by facilitating better metal-ligand interactions.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles with a carboxylic acid group result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid  
  Rationale: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that possess multiple hydroxyl groups along with a carboxylic acid group result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
  - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid  
  Rationale: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds and coordinate with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and activity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol groups on aliphatic chains and a carboxylic acid group result in high yield, whereas thiol groups attached to aromatic rings result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  Rationale: Aliphatic thiols can effectively interact with metal centers without steric hindrance, whereas aromatic thiols may not coordinate as efficiently due to delocalization.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are long-chain (more than six carbons) aliphatic acids with terminal amino groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  Rationale: Longer chains may cause steric hindrance and reduce the ability of functional groups to coordinate with the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups such as aldehydes or perfluoroalkyl chains result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  Rationale: Strong electron-withdrawing groups can destabilize interactions with the catalyst and hinder coordination.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains without additional coordinating groups result in low yield, except when the side chain contains a nitrogen heterocycle.**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)  
  Rationale: Bulky hydrophobic side chains can impede effective coordination unless they contain heteroatoms capable of interacting with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with ether linkages and carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid  
  Rationale: Ether linkages may decrease the affinity of the modifier for the catalyst's metal center due to their electron-donating nature and flexibility.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of eight carbons or fewer result in high yield if they lack additional functional groups that hinder coordination.**  
  Example:  
  - Octanoic acid  
  Rationale: Medium-chain fatty acids can interact favorably with the catalyst without steric hindrance.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid  
  Rationale: Ketone groups can reduce the electron density available for coordination with the metal center, weakening catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with meta-substituted hydroxyl groups result in low yield, whereas para-substituted hydroxyl groups may result in high yield when combined with an extended aliphatic chain.**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  Examples (Mixed Yield):  
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (High Yield)
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (Low Yield)  
  Rationale: Positioning of hydroxyl groups affects the compound's ability to coordinate with the catalyst; para-substitution with an appropriate chain length is favorable.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid  
  Rationale: Amide groups can compete with carboxylate coordination sites, diminishing interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with highly electronegative substituents like trifluoromethyl groups result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid  
  Rationale: Electronegative groups withdraw electron density, impairing effective coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that combine multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxylate) in a manner that promotes chelation to the metal center result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid  
  Rationale: Chelation enhances the stability of the modifier-metal complex, improving catalytic activity.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear, specifying that short-chain amino acids with both amino and carboxylic acid groups result in high yield. The property insight is adequate, explaining that these functional groups facilitate effective coordination with metal centers. The rule combines chain length and functional groups, showing appropriate complexity. Coverage is sufficient, supported by multiple data points such as entries 0, 2, and 3.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 provides clarity by focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted metal-coordinating groups leading to high yield. The rationale is sound, emphasizing that such substitutions enhance metal-ligand interactions. The rule effectively combines substitution position and functional group type, indicating suitable complexity. Coverage is strong with supporting examples like entries 1, 4, and 21.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in identifying that nitrogen heterocycles with a carboxylic acid group result in high yield. The property insight is appropriate, highlighting the role of nitrogen heterocycles in stabilizing the catalyst. The rule's complexity is suitable, combining ring structures with functional groups. Coverage is sufficient, supported by entries 8, 16, and 22.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly states that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups and a carboxylic acid group lead to high yield. The insight is adequate, explaining how these groups can coordinate with metal centers. The rule demonstrates complexity by combining multiple functional groups. Coverage is acceptable, with entries 6 and 9 supporting the rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing modifiers, clearly stating that aliphatic thiols result in high yield while aromatic thiols result in low yield. The property insight is reasonable, and the rule shows complexity by considering both chain type and functional group presence. Coverage is adequate, supported by entries 10 and 18.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear about long-chain aliphatic acids with terminal amino groups resulting in low yield. The rationale is acceptable, attributing low yield to steric hindrance. Complexity is appropriate, considering both chain length and functional groups. Coverage is sufficient with entries 31 and 34.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly identifies modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups like aldehydes or perfluoroalkyl chains as resulting in low yield. The insight is adequate, explaining how these groups hinder coordination. Complexity is acceptable, focusing on the impact of specific substituents. Coverage is strong with entries 14, 19, and 20.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 effectively details that amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains without coordinating groups result in low yield unless the side chain contains a nitrogen heterocycle. The rule is clear and provides appropriate property insight. Complexity is present, combining side-chain characteristics and heteroatom presence. Coverage is acceptable with entries 13 and 15.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 states that modifiers with ether linkages and carboxylic acid groups result in low yield. The clarity is acceptable, and the rationale regarding ether linkages is reasonable. The rule considers specific functional groups, showing appropriate complexity. Coverage is marginal, supported by entries 11 and 32.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 indicates that aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of eight carbons or fewer result in high yield if they lack hindering functional groups. However, the rule's clarity is reduced due to the vague term "functional groups that hinder coordination." The property insight is acceptable, but the complexity may limit applicability. Coverage is limited, primarily supported by entry 5.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 identifies modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acid groups as resulting in low yield. While the clarity is acceptable, coverage is limited with entry 27, and there may be contradictions such as entry 25 showing high yield despite the presence of a ketone group. The property insight is plausible but may need refinement.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 addresses the effect of hydroxyl group positioning on aromatic carboxylic acids, specifying low yield for meta-substituted and potential high yield for para-substituted when combined with an extended aliphatic chain. The rule is somewhat complex but clear, and the rationale is acceptable. Coverage is supported by entries 19, 7, and 30, highlighting the importance of substitution patterns.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that modifiers containing amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield. The rule is clear, and the property insight is acceptable, explaining how amide groups can compete with coordination sites. Complexity is appropriate, considering specific functional group arrangements. Coverage is sufficient with entries 24 and 26.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 specifies that modifiers with highly electronegative substituents like trifluoromethyl groups result in low yield. The rule is clear and the rationale is acceptable. However, coverage is limited, supported primarily by entry 28, which may not be sufficient for a robust rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 suggests that modifiers combining multiple coordinating functional groups that promote chelation result in high yield. While the rule is somewhat general, it is clear and the property insight is reasonable. Complexity is appropriate due to consideration of multiple functional groups. Coverage is acceptable with entries 9 and 8 supporting the rule.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with a carbon chain length of five or fewer carbons, containing both a free amino group and a carboxylic acid group, result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid  
  Rationale: Short-chain amino acids can effectively coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst due to the presence of amino and carboxylate groups, enhancing catalysis.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with functional groups capable of metal coordination, such as amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups, result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid  
  Rationale: Para-substituted groups that can interact with metal centers enhance catalyst performance by facilitating better metal-ligand interactions.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles with a carboxylic acid group result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid  
  Rationale: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that possess multiple hydroxyl groups along with a carboxylic acid group result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
  - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid  
  Rationale: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds and coordinate with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and activity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol groups on aliphatic chains and a carboxylic acid group result in high yield, whereas thiol groups attached to aromatic rings result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  Rationale: Aliphatic thiols can effectively interact with metal centers without steric hindrance, whereas aromatic thiols may not coordinate as efficiently due to delocalization.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are long-chain (more than six carbons) aliphatic acids with terminal amino groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  Rationale: Longer chains may cause steric hindrance and reduce the ability of functional groups to coordinate with the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups such as aldehydes or perfluoroalkyl chains result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  Rationale: Strong electron-withdrawing groups can destabilize interactions with the catalyst and hinder coordination.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains without additional coordinating groups result in low yield, except when the side chain contains a nitrogen heterocycle.**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)  
  Rationale: Bulky hydrophobic side chains can impede effective coordination unless they contain heteroatoms capable of interacting with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with ether linkages and carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid  
  Rationale: Ether linkages may decrease the affinity of the modifier for the catalyst's metal center due to their electron-donating nature and flexibility.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of eight carbons or fewer result in high yield if they lack additional functional groups that hinder coordination.**  
  Example:  
  - Octanoic acid  
  Rationale: Medium-chain fatty acids can interact favorably with the catalyst without steric hindrance.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid  
  Rationale: Ketone groups can reduce the electron density available for coordination with the metal center, weakening catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with meta-substituted hydroxyl groups result in low yield, whereas para-substituted hydroxyl groups may result in high yield when combined with an extended aliphatic chain.**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  Examples (Mixed Yield):  
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (High Yield)
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (Low Yield)  
  Rationale: Positioning of hydroxyl groups affects the compound's ability to coordinate with the catalyst; para-substitution with an appropriate chain length is favorable.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid  
  Rationale: Amide groups can compete with carboxylate coordination sites, diminishing interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with highly electronegative substituents like trifluoromethyl groups result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid  
  Rationale: Electronegative groups withdraw electron density, impairing effective coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that combine multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxylate) in a manner that promotes chelation to the metal center result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid  
  Rationale: Chelation enhances the stability of the modifier-metal complex, improving catalytic activity.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: In **Rule 1**, the code counts the total number of carbons in the molecule (`num_carbons = sum(1 for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6)`) to enforce `max_carbons`. However, the natural language rule specifies "carbon chain length of five or fewer carbons", referring to the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms, not the total number of carbons in the molecule. To accurately reflect the rule, modify the code to calculate the length of the longest aliphatic carbon chain. This can be achieved using RDKit's `rwmol.GetSubstructMatches()` with a SMARTS pattern for aliphatic carbon chains and finding the maximum chain length.

- **Suggestion 2**: In **Rule 2**, the code uses specific SMILES examples (`para_substituted_amino`, `para_substituted_nitro`, `para_substituted_bromomethyl`) rather than general SMARTS patterns. This approach limits the rule to only those exact structures. To generalize the rule, replace the specific SMILES with SMARTS patterns that match any para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acid with coordinating functional groups. For example:
  - Aromatic carboxylic acid: `[c][c]([c][c]([c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[!#1])[!#1]`
  - Para-substituted amino group: `[$(c1ccc(N)cc1)]`
  - Para-substituted nitro group: `[$(c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1)]`
  - Para-substituted bromomethyl group: `[$(c1ccc(CBr)cc1)]`
  Combine these patterns to match any para-substituted group capable of metal coordination.

- **Suggestion 3**: For **Rule 3**, the pattern for "nitrogen heterocycle" is `[n]`, which is too general and may match any nitrogen atom in an aromatic ring, including those not part of a heterocycle. Refine the pattern to match specific nitrogen-containing heterocycles with a carboxylic acid group. For example, use `[n;R]` to match nitrogen atoms in a ring and ensure the presence of a carboxylic acid group `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`.

- **Suggestion 4**: In **Rule 4**, the code checks for multiple hydroxyl groups using the pattern `[OX2H]`, which matches any hydroxyl group, including those on non-carbon atoms. To ensure the hydroxyl groups are attached to carbon atoms (excluding hydroxyl groups on other elements like phosphorus or sulfur), modify the pattern to `[CX4][OX2H]`. Additionally, when counting hydroxyl groups, ensure that the code correctly counts all the hydroxyl groups in the molecule using `mol.GetSubstructMatches()` and checking the length against `min_hydroxyls`.

- **Suggestion 5**: For **Rule 5**, the patterns for thiol groups on aliphatic chains (`[CX4][SX2H]`) and aromatic rings (`[c][SX2H]`) may not fully capture all relevant cases. To improve specificity:
  - Use `[CH2][SX2H]` for thiol groups on saturated aliphatic carbons.
  - Ensure that the carboxylic acid group is present by including `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`.
  - Verify that the patterns accurately distinguish between aliphatic and aromatic thiols.

- **Suggestion 6**: In **Rule 6**, similar to Suggestion 1, the code counts the total number of carbons to enforce `min_carbons`, which may not accurately reflect the length of the aliphatic chain specified in the rule. Modify the code to calculate the length of the longest aliphatic carbon chain with a terminal amino group and a carboxylic acid group. Use RDKit's `GetLongestAliphaticChain()` function or an equivalent method to find chains longer than six carbons.

- **Suggestion 7**: For **Rule 7**, the pattern for aldehydes `[CX3H1](=O)[#6]` may not match all aldehyde forms. Update it to `[CX3H1](=O)[#6]` or `[CX3H](=O)[#6]` to include cases where the aldehyde is attached to any carbon. Additionally, the perfluoroalkyl pattern `C(F)(F)F` only matches trifluoromethyl groups. To capture longer perfluoroalkyl chains, use a recursive SMARTS pattern like `[$(C(F)(F)(F)),$(C(F)(F)[F])]`.

- **Suggestion 8**: In **Rule 8**, the bulky hydrophobic side chain is represented by the benzene ring `[c1ccccc1]`, which may exclude other bulky hydrophobic groups like isopropyl or tert-butyl groups. Expand the pattern to include other bulky hydrophobic groups, such as branched aliphatic chains. Consider using a pattern like `[$([CX4]([CX4])[CX4][CX4])]` for branched aliphatic groups without coordinating heteroatoms.

- **Suggestion 9**: The exception in **Rule 8** for side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles uses the pattern `[n]` in `exclude_patterns`, which may not effectively exclude all cases. Refine the exclusion to specifically match nitrogen heterocycles attached to the side chain. For example, use a pattern that matches amino acids with side chains containing nitrogen in a ring structure: `[CX3H1](C(=O)[OX2H1])[NX3][CX4][R][n]`.

- **Suggestion 10**: The code mentions "Continue defining rules 9 to 15 similarly...", indicating that **Rules 9 to 15** have not been implemented. To fully generate an effective feature matrix, implement these rules in the code with appropriate SMARTS patterns and conditions.

- **Suggestion 11**: Review the logic used to check for pattern matches in the code. Currently, the code sets `match = False` if any required pattern is not matched. However, the `group_match` variable is used within a loop but not always effectively influencing the overall `match` status. Ensure that `match` only remains `True` if all required pattern groups have at least one match, and properly integrate `group_match` in setting `match`.

- **Suggestion 12**: When compiling SMARTS patterns, use error handling to catch any invalid patterns that may cause exceptions. Wrap the pattern compilation in try-except blocks and log any errors to facilitate debugging.

- **Suggestion 13**: In the code, when checking for hydroxyl groups in **Rule 4**, use `len(hydroxyl_matches) < rule['min_hydroxyls']` to determine if the minimum number is met. Ensure that overlapping matches are not counted multiple times by setting `unique` to `True` in `mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts(hydroxyl_group), uniquify=True)`.

- **Suggestion 14**: To account for tautomers and resonance structures, consider normalizing molecules before substructure searching. Use RDKit's canonicalization functions or tautomer enumeration to ensure consistent matching.

- **Suggestion 15**: Ensure stereochemistry is considered if relevant to the rules. For amino acids, the configuration (L or D) may affect interactions. Use SMARTS patterns that are stereochemically aware if stereochemistry is important for the rule.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Redefine Rules Using Quantifiable Molecular Descriptors**

  The current rules are qualitative and complex, making it difficult to generate numeric feature matrices from SMILES. To improve this, redefine the rules using quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. Examples include:

  - **Functional Group Counts**: Number of carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, thiol groups, ether linkages, ketone groups, amide groups, etc.
  - **Chain Lengths**: Number of carbon atoms in the longest aliphatic chain.
  - **Substituent Positions**: Positions of functional groups on aromatic rings (ortho, meta, para).
  - **Ring Counts**: Number of aromatic rings, heterocycles, or fused ring systems.
  - **Heteroatom Counts**: Number of nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur atoms in the molecule.
  - **Electronic Properties**: Presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups, calculated partial charges.

  By expressing rules in terms of these quantifiable descriptors, you can create a numerical feature matrix directly from SMILES data.

- **Advice 2**: **Use Binary Indicators for Specific Structural Features**

  Assign binary variables (1 or 0) to indicate the presence or absence of specific structural motifs or functional groups. For instance:

  - **Amino Acid Backbone**: 1 if the modifier contains an amino acid backbone, 0 otherwise.
  - **Nitrogen Heterocycles**: 1 if a nitrogen-containing heterocycle is present, 0 otherwise.
  - **Para-Substituted Aromatics**: 1 if the aromatic ring has a functional group at the para position, 0 otherwise.
  - **Hydroxyl Group Count**: Number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: 1 if electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, aldehyde, perfluoroalkyl) are present, 0 otherwise.

  This approach simplifies the extraction of features from SMILES and quantifies them for analysis.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Molecular Properties Computable from SMILES**

  Utilize computational chemistry software to calculate molecular properties that can serve as numerical features:

  - **Molecular Weight**
  - **LogP (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient)**
  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**
  - **Number of Rotatable Bonds**
  - **Hydrogen Bond Donors and Acceptors**
  - **Aromaticity Index**

  Including these properties provides a broader quantitative basis for modeling and understanding the impact on yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Consolidate Similar Rules for Clarity**

  Combine overlapping or similar rules to reduce complexity and redundancy. For example:

  - Merge **Rule 7** and **Rule 14** concerning electron-withdrawing groups into a single rule emphasizing the negative impact of such groups on yield.
  - Combine rules related to chain length and steric hindrance (**Rule 6** and parts of **Rule 8**) into a unified rule about the effect of bulky or long aliphatic chains.

  Streamlining the rules makes them easier to translate into numerical descriptors.

- **Advice 5**: **Define Rules Based on Structural Fragment Presence**

  Identify key structural fragments that correlate with high or low yields and create rules based on their presence. Use SMARTS patterns to detect these fragments in SMILES:

  - **High Yield Fragments**: Short-chain amino acids, nitrogen heterocycles with carboxylic acid groups, multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids.
  - **Low Yield Fragments**: Long aliphatic chains with terminal amino groups, modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids, ethers adjacent to carboxylic acids.

  This method allows for straightforward pattern recognition and numerical encoding.

- **Advice 6**: **Quantify Electronic Effects Using Hammett Sigma Constants**

  Assign Hammett sigma constants to substituents to quantify electronic effects:

  - Calculate the sum of sigma constants for all substituents on aromatic rings.
  - Use these sums as numerical descriptors reflecting the overall electron-donating or -withdrawing nature of the molecule.

  This quantification aids in modeling how electronic properties influence yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Include Steric Parameters**

  Incorporate steric descriptors to quantify the impact of molecular size and shape:

  - **Molar Refractivity**
  - **Van der Waals Volume**
  - **Sterimol Parameters** (if 3D structures are available)

  These descriptors help assess how steric hindrance may affect catalyst interactions and reaction yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Develop a Descriptor Matrix for Machine Learning**

  Create a comprehensive descriptor matrix with all the quantified features mentioned. Use this matrix for data-driven modeling approaches like:

  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to identify the most significant features.
  - **Regression Models** (e.g., Multiple Linear Regression, PLS) to correlate descriptors with yield.
  - **Classification Algorithms** (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) to predict high or low yield.

  This will not only improve rule generation but also enhance predictive capabilities.

- **Advice 9**: **Automate Feature Extraction from SMILES**

  Utilize cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit) to automate the calculation of descriptors from SMILES strings:

  - Write scripts to parse SMILES and compute all required descriptors.
  - Ensure that the feature extraction process is reproducible and scalable for larger datasets.

  Automation reduces manual errors and accelerates data processing.

- **Advice 10**: **Iteratively Refine Rules Based on Model Performance**

  Use the insights from predictive models to refine and validate the rules:

  - Analyze misclassifications to identify shortcomings in the current rules.
  - Update rules to account for new patterns or exceptions discovered through modeling.
  - Continuously improve the ruleset to enhance its accuracy and utility.

  This iterative approach ensures that the rules remain relevant and effective.

  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating methyl group)
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (aldehyde substituent)  
  **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen atom, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids or aminocarboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Short-chain amino acids efficiently coordinate with metal centers due to minimal steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **Octanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Long-chain fatty acids can interact hydrophobically with the catalyst matrix, potentially improving catalyst stability and dispersion.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in high yield, whereas those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with metal centers without the steric and electronic delocalization effects present in aromatic systems.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups along with a carboxylic acid group result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance through stronger coordination.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups adjacent to aromatic rings result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or reduce the electron density available for coordination, hindering effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with ether linkages and carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are poor ligands compared to carboxylates and may not coordinate effectively with the metal centers, reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with heavily fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can impede interaction with the catalyst and decrease yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in low yield; however, if the side chain contains heteroatoms capable of coordination, the yield is high.**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)  
  **Rationale**: Bulky hydrophobic side chains without coordinating groups hinder effective interaction with the catalyst, whereas heteroatoms in the side chain can enhance coordination.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for coordination sites or alter the geometry needed for effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with para-substituted phenolic hydroxyl groups and an extended aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) result in high yield; shorter chains result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Longer aliphatic chains may enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, facilitating better positioning for coordination.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-donating alkoxy groups on aromatic rings result in variable yields depending on chain length and additional functional groups.**  
  Example (High Yield):  
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups can increase electron density but may still allow for effective coordination if other structural features compensate.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxylate) in configurations that promote chelation to the metal center result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Chelation increases the stability of the modifier-metal complex, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with secondary or tertiary amines linked through flexible chains to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Flexible chains may reduce the effective coordination of functional groups due to conformational freedom, decreasing interaction with the catalyst.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: This rule is clear and well-defined, making it easy to determine whether a modifier fits the criteria. It provides solid chemical insight into how electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination with metal centers. The rule effectively combines multiple sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, and para-substituents), demonstrating appropriate complexity. It is supported by multiple data points, ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 2**: The rule is clearly stated and offers valuable insight into the role of nitrogen-containing heterocycles in metal coordination. It appropriately focuses on specific sub-structures, showing sufficient complexity. With three supporting data points, the rule has strong coverage and effectively guides predictions about modifier performance.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and incorporates both functional groups and chain length, providing meaningful chemical insight into steric effects on coordination. It balances complexity by considering combinations of features and has robust coverage with multiple high and low yield examples, enhancing its reliability.

- **Comment 4**: While the rule is straightforward and presents a plausible rationale regarding hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst matrix, it lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one data point. Additional examples are necessary to validate the rule and strengthen its applicability.

- **Comment 5**: This rule clearly differentiates between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing modifiers, offering good chemical reasoning. It considers combinations of functional groups, adding appropriate complexity. However, coverage is limited to one high-yield and one low-yield example. More data points would enhance the rule's credibility.

- **Comment 6**: The rule is clear and provides strong insight into how multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate chelation with metal centers. It combines multiple functional groups, demonstrating suitable complexity. With two supporting data points, it has acceptable coverage, but additional examples would further solidify the rule's validity.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is well-defined and offers a clear rationale about the negative impact of electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups adjacent to aromatic rings. It adequately balances complexity and has sufficient coverage with two supporting examples, making it a reliable guideline.

- **Comment 8**: This rule is clear and provides logical chemical insight into why ether linkages may reduce catalytic activity. It appropriately combines functional groups for moderate complexity. With two data points supporting the rule, it has reasonable coverage, reinforcing its effectiveness.

- **Comment 9**: Although the rule is clear and the rationale is sound regarding the effects of heavily fluorinated chains, it suffers from limited coverage with only one supporting data point. Additional examples are needed to confirm the rule's consistency and enhance its reliability.

- **Comment 10**: The rule addresses the complexity of side-chain effects on amino acids with clarity, providing valuable insight into how coordinating heteroatoms influence yield. Coverage is minimal, with only one high-yield and one low-yield example. Expanding the dataset would improve the rule's robustness and applicability.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clearly articulated and offers a solid explanation for how amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acids can hinder coordination. It has appropriate complexity and is supported by two data points, providing sufficient coverage to make the rule dependable.

- **Comment 12**: This rule is somewhat complex but understandable, considering both the length of the aliphatic chain and functional groups. It presents a reasonable rationale for the influence of chain length on yield. With one high-yield and one low-yield example, coverage is acceptable but could be strengthened with more data points.

- **Comment 13**: The rule lacks clarity due to its vagueness about "variable yields" and dependent conditions. The property insight is limited, and with only one supporting data point, the coverage is insufficient. Refinement and additional data are necessary to make this rule effective and reliable.

- **Comment 14**: While providing good insight into the importance of multiple coordinating functional groups, this rule overlaps with others (e.g., Rules 2 and 6), leading to redundancy. Its broad nature may reduce clarity. Consolidating it with related rules and providing more supporting data would enhance its usefulness.

- **Comment 15**: The rule is clear and offers a logical rationale about flexible chains reducing effective coordination. However, it is based on a single data point, limiting its coverage. Additional supporting examples are required to validate the rule and confirm its general applicability.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents in the para position result in high yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating methyl group)
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (aldehyde substituent)  
  **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen atom, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids or aminocarboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Short-chain amino acids efficiently coordinate with metal centers due to minimal steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **Octanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Long-chain fatty acids can interact hydrophobically with the catalyst matrix, potentially improving catalyst stability and dispersion.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in high yield, whereas those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with metal centers without the steric and electronic delocalization effects present in aromatic systems.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups along with a carboxylic acid group result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance through stronger coordination.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups adjacent to aromatic rings result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or reduce the electron density available for coordination, hindering effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with ether linkages and carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are poor ligands compared to carboxylates and may not coordinate effectively with the metal centers, reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with heavily fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can impede interaction with the catalyst and decrease yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in low yield; however, if the side chain contains heteroatoms capable of coordination, the yield is high.**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)  
  **Rationale**: Bulky hydrophobic side chains without coordinating groups hinder effective interaction with the catalyst, whereas heteroatoms in the side chain can enhance coordination.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for coordination sites or alter the geometry needed for effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with para-substituted phenolic hydroxyl groups and an extended aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) result in high yield; shorter chains result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Longer aliphatic chains may enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, facilitating better positioning for coordination.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-donating alkoxy groups on aromatic rings result in variable yields depending on chain length and additional functional groups.**  
  Example (High Yield):  
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups can increase electron density but may still allow for effective coordination if other structural features compensate.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxylate) in configurations that promote chelation to the metal center result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Chelation increases the stability of the modifier-metal complex, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with secondary or tertiary amines linked through flexible chains to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Flexible chains may reduce the effective coordination of functional groups due to conformational freedom, decreasing interaction with the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Improve the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 to correctly identify aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents in the para position.** The current pattern `'[c][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` may not specifically capture a carboxylic acid directly attached to an aromatic ring. A more accurate pattern would be `c1ccccc1C(=O)O`, which represents benzoic acid. To check for electron-withdrawing groups in the para position, you can label the atoms and specify substituents at the para position using SMARTS atom mapping (e.g., `c1cc([#6])ccc1C(=O)O` where `[#6]` can be replaced with EWG patterns at the para position).

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Specify positional relationships in SMARTS patterns for substituents in specific positions (e.g., para, ortho).** For rules that depend on substituent positions on an aromatic ring, use atom mapping and ring numbering to define positions. For example, for para-substituted benzene rings, use `c1cc(ccc1[N,O,F,Cl,Br,I])C(=O)O` to indicate an EWG at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Assign unique identifiers for each rule variation to avoid confusion in the feature matrix.** Currently, rules with both positive and negative predictions (e.g., Rule 5) share the same rule number, leading to duplicate columns with the same name in the matrix. Differentiate them by appending suffixes like `Rule 5_Pos` and `Rule 5_Neg` to maintain clarity.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Enhance error handling and provide detailed logging for pattern matching failures.** Implement logging to capture which patterns fail to match and why. This will help identify issues with SMARTS patterns or parsing errors with specific SMILES strings.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Refine SMARTS patterns for chain length-specific rules by calculating chain lengths programmatically.** For rules like Rule 3 and Rule 4, instead of relying solely on SMARTS patterns, traverse the molecule's graph to compute the actual chain length of aliphatic chains and compare it against the specified thresholds.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Ensure that functional group exclusions in rules are correctly implemented using SMARTS.** For Rule 4, the exclusion patterns may not effectively prevent matches with molecules containing other functional groups. Review and adjust patterns like `'[O,N,S]'` to accurately represent the excluded groups and use negative lookups if necessary.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Adjust patterns to consider the context of functional groups within the molecule.** Patterns should ensure that functional groups are matched in the correct molecular environment. For example, confirm that carboxylic acid groups are not only present but are also connected as specified in the rule (e.g., attached to a certain carbon chain length or ring system).

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Improve the pattern for multiple coordinating functional groups (Rule 14) to accurately capture chelating agents.** The current simplified pattern may miss molecules where coordinating groups are appropriately positioned. Use recursive SMARTS or more detailed subpatterns to detect configurations that promote chelation.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Utilize RDKit's advanced substructure search options to refine matching criteria.** Employ parameters like `useChirality`, `useQueryQueryMatches`, and `maxMatches` to control the matching behavior and ensure the patterns are as specific as needed.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Validate and iteratively refine SMARTS patterns using a test set of known compounds.** Before applying the patterns to the full dataset, test them on a subset with known outcomes to ensure they match the intended structures. Adjust the patterns based on the validation results.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance:**

Comparing the current metrics to the previous reference metrics, we observe the following:

1. **Train Support:**
   - **Previous Train Support:** 0.1667 and 0.1845
   - **Current Train Support:** 0.0095
   - **Comment:** The current train support has significantly decreased compared to previous iterations. This indicates that the current set of rules covers a much smaller portion of the training data. A low support value suggests that the rules are too specific and may not generalize well to new data. The rules might be capturing rare conditions that do not frequently occur in the dataset.

2. **Train Confidence:**
   - **Previous Train Confidence:** 0.6352 and 0.5396
   - **Current Train Confidence:** 0.6111
   - **Comment:** The train confidence remains relatively consistent with previous metrics. This implies that, for the small subset of data the rules apply to, they are fairly accurate. However, without sufficient support, high confidence alone is not indicative of overall rule performance.

3. **Train Lift:**
   - **Previous Train Lift:** 1.2048 and 1.0559
   - **Current Train Lift:** 1.2162
   - **Comment:** There is a slight increase in train lift compared to previous metrics. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule's prediction is better than random chance. The increase suggests that the rules have become slightly more effective at identifying instances where the outcome is positive. However, the marginal improvement may not compensate for the significant drop in support.

4. **Train Leverage:**
   - **Previous Train Leverage:** 0.0289 and -0.0041
   - **Current Train Leverage:** 0.0047
   - **Comment:** The leverage has decreased from the highest previous value. Positive leverage indicates a stronger association than expected by chance, but the decrease suggests that the strength of the association is weaker than before. The small value also reflects the low support, indicating limited practical significance.

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

The sharp decline in train support indicates that the current rules have become too narrowly focused, possibly due to overfitting during the iterative process. The high specificity of the rules may have led to capturing noise rather than meaningful patterns. Given that further iterations have resulted in diminishing support without substantial gains in confidence or lift, it is likely that a local minimum has been reached. Continuing with additional iterations under the same approach may not improve the performance and could further reduce the generalizability of the rules.

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules:**

1. **Increase Rule Generalization:**
   - **Simplify Rule Conditions:** Review the current rules to identify overly specific criteria. Loosen strict conditions to make the rules more inclusive. For example, instead of specifying exact chain lengths or positions of substituents, consider broader categories like "short-chain" vs. "long-chain" or "electron-donating groups" vs. "electron-withdrawing groups."
   - **Use Broader Chemical Classes:** Group modifiers by broader chemical classes or functional groups to increase coverage. This can help in capturing general trends rather than specific instances.

2. **Combine Similar Rules:**
   - **Merge Redundant Rules:** Identify rules that have similar rationales or overlapping conditions. Combining them can increase support while maintaining confidence. For instance, rules 1 and 13 both deal with aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents; consider integrating them into a single, more general rule.

3. **Re-evaluate Low-Support Rules:**
   - **Eliminate or Revise Low-Impact Rules:** Rules with extremely low support may not contribute significantly to the model's predictive power. Consider removing or revising such rules to focus on more impactful patterns.

4. **Balance Support and Confidence:**
   - **Optimize Trade-Offs:** Strive for a balance between support and confidence. While high confidence is desirable, very low support undermines the utility of the rules. Aim to improve support even if it results in a slight decrease in confidence, as long as the confidence remains acceptable.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data Analysis:**
   - **Perform Feature Importance Analysis:** Use statistical methods to determine which features (modifier properties) most influence the yield. This can guide the refinement of rules to focus on the most impactful features.
   - **Cluster Analysis:** Group modifiers based on similarities and analyze the yield within clusters to identify new patterns that can inform rule adjustments.

6. **Validate with Test Data:**
   - **Obtain Test Metrics:** Since only train metrics are provided, it's important to evaluate the rules on test data to assess their generalizability. High train confidence with low test confidence indicates overfitting.
   - **Monitor Test Support and Confidence:** Ensure that improvements in train metrics are reflected in the test metrics to confirm that the rules perform well on unseen data.

7. **Re-assess Rule Rationales:**
   - **Challenge Assumptions:** Revisit the rationales behind each rule to verify their validity. It's possible that some chemical assumptions do not hold true across the dataset. Seek input from domain experts if necessary.
   - **Update Chemical Knowledge Integration:** Incorporate recent scientific findings or alternative theories that might explain the observed outcomes better.

8. **Adjust Iterative Process:**
   - **Review Iteration Strategy:** Modify the criteria for rule adjustments in each iteration. Introducing random perturbations or alternative optimization techniques may help escape a local minimum.
   - **Set New Objectives:** If a local minimum is causing stagnation, redefining the optimization goals (e.g., placing more emphasis on support) could provide a new direction for improvement.

**Conclusion:**

The current rules exhibit high confidence and lift but suffer from significantly reduced support, suggesting they are too specialized and not broadly applicable. To enhance performance, it is essential to generalize the rules to cover a larger portion of the dataset while maintaining reasonable confidence levels. This involves simplifying rule conditions, combining similar rules, and focusing on more impactful features. Additionally, validating the rules against test data is crucial to ensure they generalize well and are not merely capturing noise. By adjusting the iterative process and reassessing the rule rationales, it's possible to overcome the local minimum and develop a more effective set of rules that better predict high yield outcomes in the catalytic problem.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Comments on Accuracies of the Validation Set and Training Set:**

The current validation accuracy obtained using the classification model is **0.6**, which is a noticeable decrease from the previous validation accuracies that consistently hovered around **0.76**. Similarly, previous test accuracies ranged from **0.75** to **0.625**, whereas the current iteration's test accuracy hasn't been explicitly provided but can be inferred to be lower based on the validation performance. This decline in accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be effectively capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

The drop in validation accuracy indicates potential issues with the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data. It could be a sign of underfitting, where the model is too simple to capture complex relationships, or it may point to the necessity of refining the existing rules to better align with the dataset's characteristics.

---

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into the contribution of each rule (feature) to the model's predictions for individual molecules. By examining the SHAP values, we can identify which rules are influencing the predictions, especially in cases where the model's predictions do not match the experimental values.

Here are the key observations from the SHAP analysis:

1. **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**
   - **Molecules:**
     - *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
     - *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*
     - *C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN*
     - *C(CCCN)CCC(=O)O*
     - *C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O*
     - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O*
     - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=NC=C2)C(=O)O*
     - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)S*
   - **Contributing Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
     - **Rule 8:** Consistently shows high positive SHAP values (~0.04156), contributing significantly to the overestimation of loading.
     - **Rule 6 and Rule 10:** Also exhibit positive SHAP values but to a lesser extent compared to Rule 8.

2. **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**
   - No significant cases were observed where the model predicted low loading while the experimental value was high. This suggests that underestimations are less problematic in the current model.

**Interpretation:**

- **Rule 8** appears to be **contributing excessively** to predicting high loading, even for molecules where the experimental value is low. This indicates that the conditions defined in Rule 8 may be too broad or not accurately capturing the intended chemical characteristics associated with low yield modifiers.
- **Rules 6 and 10** also contribute positively to the high loading predictions in overestimated cases, though their impact is less pronounced than Rule 8. This suggests these rules might require refinement to prevent misclassification.

---

**Thoughts on Improving Current Rules Used to Generate the Feature Matrix:**

Given the observations from the SHAP analysis and the decreased validation accuracy, it is evident that certain rules need refinement to improve the model's performance. Here are recommendations for specific rules:

1. **Refine Rule 8:**
   - **Current Issue:** Rule 8 states that modifiers with ether linkages and carboxylic acid groups result in low yield. However, the SHAP analysis shows that Rule 8 is assigning high positive values in cases where the model overestimates loading (predicts high loading when experimental value is low).
   - **Suggested Improvement:**
     - **Re-express Rule 8** to more accurately identify modifiers that should result in low yield.
     - **Consider Specificity:** Perhaps only certain types of ether linkages or their positions relative to the carboxylic acid affect the yield. Introduce criteria to differentiate between different ethers.
     - **Example Adjustment:** Modify Rule 8 to focus on **long-chain aliphatic ethers** versus **aryl ethers**, or specify the chain length and branching that lead to low yield.

2. **Adjust Rule 6:**
   - **Current Issue:** Rule 6 suggests that modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups along with a carboxylic acid group result in high yield. However, this may be too general and could inadvertently include molecules that do not contribute to high yield.
   - **Suggested Improvement:**
     - **Increase Specificity:** Define the position and configuration of hydroxyl groups. Perhaps only certain stereochemistry or proximity to the carboxylic acid enhances chelation.
     - **Exclude Certain Structures:** Identify if there are specific structural motifs within polyhydroxylated compounds that do not contribute to high yield and adjust the rule accordingly.

3. **Reevaluate Rule 10:**
   - **Current Issue:** Rule 10 differentiates between amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms (low yield) and those with side chains containing heteroatoms (high yield). The rule may not adequately cover all variations, leading to misclassification.
   - **Suggested Improvement:**
     - **Clarify Definitions:** Provide clear definitions of what constitutes a "bulky hydrophobic side chain" and specify which heteroatoms are effective in coordination.
     - **Include Exceptions:** If certain bulky amino acids unexpectedly contribute to high yield, note these exceptions and adjust the rule to accommodate them.

4. **General Recommendations:**
   - **Incorporate Additional Descriptors:** Consider adding more features to the model that capture other chemical properties influencing catalyst performance, such as electronic properties, steric hindrance, or solubility parameters.
   - **Review Overlapping Rules:** Check for overlaps or contradictions between rules that might confuse the model. Ensuring each rule is distinct and non-redundant can improve clarity.
   - **Balance Rule Complexity:** Avoid making rules overly complex, which can lead to overfitting. Aim for a balance where rules are specific enough to capture key patterns but general enough to apply to new data.

---

**Assess Overfitting/Underfitting:**

The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the model might be **underfitting** the data. This underfitting could be due to:

- **Rules Being Too General:** If the rules are not capturing specific nuances of the data, the model cannot distinguish between high and low yield modifiers effectively.
- **Insufficient Rules:** There may be important chemical features not currently accounted for in the rules.
- **Data Distribution:** If the dataset has an imbalance between high and low yield modifiers, the model might struggle to learn the minority class.

**Suggestions to Address Underfitting:**

- **Introduce New Rules:** Based on chemical intuition and literature, add new rules that capture missing patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract additional molecular descriptors using cheminformatics tools to provide more information to the model.
- **Model Complexity:** Consider using a more complex model if appropriate, though caution should be taken to avoid overfitting.

---

**Derive Insights from SHAP Analysis for Rule Improvement:**

- **Focus on High SHAP Contributors:** Since Rule 8 contributes significantly to overestimations, refining this rule could lead to immediate improvements in accuracy.
- **Investigate Misclassified Molecules:** Examine the structural features of molecules that are frequently misclassified to identify patterns not currently captured by the rules.
- **Iterative Testing:** After adjusting rules, retrain the model and perform SHAP analysis again to assess the impact of changes.

---

**Conclusion:**

To enhance the performance of the classification model:

- **Refine existing rules** by increasing their specificity and ensuring they accurately reflect the underlying chemistry influencing catalyst loading and yield.
- **Address underfitting** by possibly adding new rules or features that capture additional relevant chemical information.
- **Use SHAP analysis iteratively** to guide rule adjustments, focusing on rules that contribute most to misclassifications.
- **Monitor Model Performance:** Continuously compare the validation accuracy to previous iterations to ensure that changes lead to tangible improvements.

By systematically applying these strategies, the model's predictive accuracy on the validation set should improve, leading to better generalization on unseen data.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules:**

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction using various molecular modifiers has been analyzed, revealing several areas for improvement:

1. **Performance Metrics Indicate Over-Specificity:**
   - **Low Train Support:** The current train support is **0.0095**, significantly lower than previous values (approximately **0.17**). This suggests that the rules are too specific and apply to only a small portion of the data.
   - **Train Confidence and Lift:** While the train confidence remains relatively stable at **0.6111**, the low support undermines the practical significance of this confidence. The slight increase in train lift to **1.2162** does not compensate for the decreased support.
   - **Decreased Validation Accuracy:** The validation accuracy has dropped to **0.6** from previous values of **0.76**, indicating reduced generalizability and potential underfitting.

2. **Possible Overfitting and Local Minimum:**
   - The sharp decline in support and validation accuracy suggests the model may have reached a **local minimum**, where further iterations under the same approach yield diminishing returns.
   - The rules may have become too narrowly focused, capturing noise rather than meaningful patterns, leading to overfitting.

3. **SHAP Analysis Highlights Rule Issues:**
   - **Rule 8 Overestimation:** Rule 8 is contributing excessively to predicting high loading even when experimental values are low. This indicates the rule may be misclassifying modifiers due to overly broad or inaccurate criteria.
   - **Rules 6 and 10 Require Refinement:** These rules also show positive SHAP values in misclassified cases, suggesting they may need adjustments to prevent incorrect predictions.

**Directions and Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Generalize and Simplify Rules:**
   - **Loosen Overly Strict Conditions:** Broaden the criteria in overly specific rules to increase coverage without significantly sacrificing accuracy.
   - **Focus on Broader Chemical Classes:** Group modifiers by general chemical properties (e.g., "aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups") rather than specific substitutions.
   - **Combine Similar Rules:** Merge rules with overlapping rationales to enhance support and reduce redundancy.

2. **Refine Specific Rules Based on SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Refine Rule 8 (Modifiers with Ether Linkages):**
     - **Issue:** Rule 8 is misclassifying modifiers by predicting high loading for low-yield modifiers.
     - **Suggestion:** Adjust the SMARTS pattern to more accurately identify ethers that lead to low yield. Specify the type and position of ether linkages relative to the carboxylic acid. For example, differentiate between aliphatic and aromatic ethers or specify chain lengths.

   - **Adjust Rule 6 (Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups):**
     - **Issue:** Rule 6 may be too general, including compounds that do not contribute to high yield.
     - **Suggestion:** Refine the rule to specify the positions and configurations of hydroxyl groups that enhance chelation. Exclude structures where hydroxyl groups are less likely to coordinate effectively with the metal center.

   - **Reevaluate Rule 10 (Amino Acids with Bulky Side Chains):**
     - **Issue:** Rule 10 may not adequately differentiate between modifiers that contribute to high or low yield.
     - **Suggestion:** Clarify definitions of "bulky hydrophobic side chains" and specify which heteroatoms enhance coordination. Incorporate exceptions where necessary and refine SMARTS patterns accordingly.

3. **Enhance SMARTS Patterns and Matching:**

   - **Specify Positional Relationships:**
     - Use precise SMARTS patterns to capture substituents at specific positions (e.g., para position on aromatic rings). For example, use atom mapping to define positions relative to functional groups.
     - Example: For para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups on benzoic acid, use a pattern like `c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O`.

   - **Correct Functional Group Exclusions:**
     - Ensure exclusions in SMARTS patterns are correctly implemented using appropriate syntax. Use negative lookups or logical operators to accurately exclude certain functional groups.

   - **Calculate Chain Lengths Programmatically:**
     - Instead of relying solely on SMARTS patterns for chain length, traverse the molecular graph to compute actual chain lengths and apply rules based on calculated values.

4. **Balance Support and Confidence:**

   - **Increase Rule Coverage:** Modify rules to apply to a larger portion of the dataset, even if it results in a slight decrease in confidence, as long as the overall predictive power improves.
   - **Reassess Low-Support Rules:** Remove or revise rules that have minimal impact due to low support.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data Analysis:**

   - **Feature Importance Analysis:** Use statistical methods to identify key molecular features influencing yield and prioritize these in rule refinement.
   - **Cluster Analysis:** Group modifiers based on structural similarities to uncover patterns not previously captured.

6. **Enhance Validation and Iteration Process:**

   - **Iteratively Test and Refine:** After adjusting rules, re-evaluate model performance on validation and test sets to ensure improvements are generalizable.
   - **Monitor Metrics Closely:** Keep track of support, confidence, lift, and accuracy across iterations to avoid overfitting.

7. **Reassess Rule Rationales:**

   - **Validate Chemical Assumptions:** Ensure that each rule's chemical rationale is sound and aligns with observed data trends.
   - **Seek Expert Input:** Consult with chemists or domain experts to validate assumptions and gain insights into reaction mechanisms.

8. **Improve Error Handling and Logging:**

   - **Detailed Logging:** Implement logging for pattern matching failures to identify and correct issues with SMARTS patterns or SMILES parsing.
   - **Error Analysis:** Analyze mismatches between predicted and experimental values to identify systematic errors.

**Judgment on Possibility for Further Optimization:**

Given the significant decrease in train support and validation accuracy, as well as the issues identified through SHAP analysis, there is considerable room for further optimization of the current rules. Refining the rules as suggested above can enhance model performance without overfitting by improving generalization, correcting misclassifications, and ensuring the rules are chemically and statistically sound.

  Examples:  
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen atom, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids or aminocarboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Short-chain amino acids efficiently coordinate with metal centers due to minimal steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **Octanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Long-chain fatty acids can interact hydrophobically with the catalyst matrix, potentially improving catalyst stability and dispersion.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in high yield, whereas those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with metal centers without the steric and electronic delocalization effects present in aromatic systems.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups along with a carboxylic acid group result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance through stronger coordination.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups adjacent to aromatic rings result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or reduce the electron density available for coordination, hindering effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with ether linkages and carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are poor ligands compared to carboxylates and may not coordinate effectively with the metal centers, reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with heavily fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can impede interaction with the catalyst and decrease yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in low yield; however, if the side chain contains heteroatoms capable of coordination, the yield is high.**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)  
  **Rationale**: Bulky hydrophobic side chains without coordinating groups hinder effective interaction with the catalyst, whereas heteroatoms in the side chain can enhance coordination.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for coordination sites or alter the geometry needed for effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with para-substituted phenolic hydroxyl groups and an extended aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) result in high yield; shorter chains result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Longer aliphatic chains may enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, facilitating better positioning for coordination.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-donating alkoxy groups on aromatic rings result in variable yields depending on chain length and additional functional groups.**  
  Example (High Yield):  
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups can increase electron density but may still allow for effective coordination if other structural features compensate.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxylate) in configurations that promote chelation to the metal center result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Chelation increases the stability of the modifier-metal complex, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with secondary or tertiary amines linked through flexible chains to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Flexible chains may reduce the effective coordination of functional groups due to conformational freedom, decreasing interaction with the catalyst.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Generalize Overly Specific Rules to Increase Coverage**
  - **Action**: Combine similar rules with overlapping rationales to reduce redundancy and broaden applicability.
    - **Example**: Merge **Rule 1** (aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents) and **Rule 2** (nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids) into a single rule focusing on **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing features**, including heterocycles.
  - **Rationale**: Broadening the rules will increase train support and help capture more relevant modifiers without sacrificing accuracy.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rule 8 (Modifiers with Ether Linkages)**
  - **Issue**: Rule 8 misclassifies modifiers by predicting high yield for low-yield cases due to broad SMARTS patterns.
  - **Action**:
    - **Specify Ether Position**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to target ethers directly connected to the carboxylic acid group.
      - **Example SMARTS**: `[CX3](=O)[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX3](=O)` to identify polyether chains adjacent to carboxyl groups.
    - **Differentiate Ether Types**: Exclude aromatic ethers or ethers in side chains far from the carboxyl group.
  - **Rationale**: Precise patterns will reduce false positives by only matching ethers that negatively affect yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rule 6 (Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups)**
  - **Issue**: Rule 6 is too general and may include ineffective modifiers.
  - **Action**:
    - **Specify Chelation Sites**: Modify the rule to require hydroxyl groups positioned to form chelate rings with metal centers.
      - **Example SMARTS**: `C(O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)C(=O)O` to match sugar acids like gluconic acid.
    - **Exclude Non-Chelating Structures**: Ensure modifiers without appropriate hydroxyl positioning are not matched.
  - **Rationale**: Focusing on chelation-capable structures enhances the rule's predictive power for high yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Reevaluate Rule 10 (Amino Acids with Bulky Side Chains)**
  - **Issue**: Rule 10 does not clearly differentiate modifiers affecting yield.
  - **Action**:
    - **Clarify Definitions**: Define "bulky hydrophobic side chains" and identify coordinating heteroatoms explicitly.
    - **Update SMARTS Patterns**:
      - **Low Yield Modifiers**: `[NX3][CX4][CX3](c1ccccc1)[C](=O)O` to match amino acids like phenylalanine lacking coordinating atoms.
      - **High Yield Modifiers**: `[NX3][CX4][CX3](C2=CNC1=CC=CC=C12)[C](=O)O` for tryptophan with an indole nitrogen capable of coordination.
  - **Rationale**: Clear distinctions improve the rule's accuracy in predicting yield based on side-chain properties.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance SMARTS Patterns for Positional Specificity**
  - **Action**:
    - **Specify Substitution Positions**: Use SMARTS patterns that define positions relative to functional groups.
      - **Example**: `c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)O` for para-substituted benzoic acids.
    - **Implement Correct Exclusions**: Utilize logical operators to exclude certain groups.
      - **Example**: `[$([OH]),$([NH2])]!@[CX3](=O)O` to exclude modifiers with hydroxyl or amino groups directly bonded to the carboxylic acid.
  - **Rationale**: Precise positional definitions reduce misclassifications and improve rule reliability.

- **Advice 6**: **Calculate Chain Lengths Programmatically**
  - **Action**:
    - **Implement Molecular Graph Traversal**: Use cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit) to compute actual chain lengths.
    - **Apply Chain Length Criteria in Rules**: Use calculated lengths to enforce rules based on chain length thresholds.
  - **Rationale**: Accurate chain length assessment ensures modifiers are classified correctly according to chain-dependent rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Balance Support and Confidence by Broadening Rules**
  - **Action**:
    - **Modify Rules to Increase Coverage**: Relax overly strict conditions that limit rule applicability.
      - **Example**: Expand Rule 4 to include medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids, not just long-chain ones.
    - **Monitor Impact on Confidence**: Ensure that increased support does not significantly reduce confidence.
  - **Rationale**: A balanced approach improves model performance by considering more data without overfitting.

- **Advice 8**: **Reassess and Consolidate Low-Support Rules**
  - **Action**:
    - **Evaluate Rule Effectiveness**: Identify rules with minimal impact due to low support.
    - **Remove or Merge Rules**: Eliminate ineffective rules or combine them with others to strengthen their contribution.
  - **Rationale**: Streamlining the rule set focuses the model on the most predictive features.

    - **Integrate Findings into Rules**: Adjust or create rules based on insights from data analysis.
  - **Rationale**: Data-driven adjustments enhance rule relevance and predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Chemical Rationales**
  - **Action**:
    - **Consult Literature and Experts**: Ensure chemical assumptions align with established knowledge.
    - **Adjust Rules Accordingly**: Modify rules that are not supported by chemical evidence.
  - **Rationale**: Scientifically validated rules are more likely to predict outcomes accurately.

- **Advice 11**: **Enhance Validation and Iterative Testing**
  - **Action**:
    - **Iteratively Test Adjusted Rules**: Evaluate changes using validation and test sets after each iteration.
    - **Monitor Performance Metrics**: Track support, confidence, lift, and accuracy to avoid overfitting.
  - **Rationale**: Regular validation ensures that rule changes lead to genuine improvements.

- **Advice 12**: **Improve Error Handling and Logging**
  - **Action**:
    - **Implement Detailed Logging**: Record pattern matching successes and failures.
    - **Analyze Misclassifications**: Identify systematic errors in rule application or pattern definitions.
  - **Rationale**: Enhanced debugging capabilities facilitate the correction of issues affecting model performance.

  Examples:  
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Niacin)  
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**  
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Nitrogen heterocycles coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen atom, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in high yield; aromatic thiol-containing acids result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with metal centers without the steric and electronic delocalization present in aromatic systems.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)  
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance through stronger coordination.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield; addition of polar groups leads to low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **Octanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (hydroxyl group)  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (amino group)  
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Unsubstituted long-chain fatty acids interact hydrophobically with the catalyst matrix, improving stability. Polar functional groups may interfere with catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages and carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**  
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are poor ligands compared to carboxylates and may not coordinate effectively with metal centers, reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with heavily fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can impede interaction with the catalyst and decrease yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in low yield; side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination result in high yield.**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)  
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (N-Acetyllysine)  
  Example (High Yield):  
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)  
  **Rationale**: Bulky hydrophobic side chains without coordinating groups hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. Heteroatoms in side chains can enhance coordination.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**  
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for coordination sites or alter the geometry needed for effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings bearing multiple methoxy groups and a ketone in the aliphatic chain result in high yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Electron-donating methoxy groups increase electron density, and the ketone can participate in coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups on long aliphatic chains (more than five carbons) result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**  
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Polar terminal groups increase solubility in the reaction medium and may interfere with catalyst interactions or reduce effective coordination.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with electron-donating alkyl groups on aromatic carboxylic acids result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylic acid, reducing interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxylate) in configurations that promote chelation to the metal center result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)  
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Chelation increases the stability of the modifier-metal complex, enhancing catalytic efficiency through stronger and multidentate coordination.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1 is clear, specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, halogens) result in high yield. The rationale provides adequate physicochemical insight by explaining how coordinating substituents enhance interaction with the catalyst and how electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity, improving coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures—aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, and coordinating substituents—satisfying the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by multiple data points in the dataset (e.g., high yields with 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid; low yields with 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid), demonstrating good coverage.**

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2 is clear in stating that aliphatic amino acids or aminocarboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield, while longer chains result in low yield. The rationale provides physicochemical insight by highlighting how shorter chains minimize steric hindrance and enhance coordination with metal centers, whereas longer chains may hinder coordination due to increased flexibility. The rule combines considerations of functional groups (amino and carboxylate) and chain length, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., high yields with (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid; low yields with 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid), indicating strong coverage.**

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde substituents result in low yield. The rationale offers physicochemical insight by explaining that aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or reduce electron density for coordination, hindering effective catalyst interaction. The rule combines structural features (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, aldehyde substituent), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points such as low yields with 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, demonstrating adequate coverage.**

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4 specifies that carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles result in high yield. The rationale provides insight into how nitrogen heterocycles coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen atom, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity. The rule combines the presence of a carboxylic acid group with a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, meeting the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by data points (e.g., high yields with pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), indicating strong coverage.**

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5 differentiates between aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups, stating that aliphatic thiol-containing acids result in high yield, whereas aromatic ones result in low yield. The rationale provides physicochemical insight by explaining that aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively without the steric and electronic delocalization present in aromatic systems. The rule considers both the type of thiol and the aliphatic or aromatic nature of the molecule, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points such as high yield with 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (aliphatic thiol) and low yield with 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (aromatic thiol), demonstrating good coverage.**

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6 states that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield. The rationale offers physicochemical insight by explaining that multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance through stronger coordination. The rule combines the presence of a carboxylic acid group with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points like high yield with gluconic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid, indicating good coverage.**

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7 indicates that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield, whereas the addition of polar groups leads to low yield. The rationale provides insight by discussing how unsubstituted long-chain fatty acids improve stability through hydrophobic interactions, while polar functional groups may interfere with catalyst interactions. The rule combines chain length with the presence or absence of polar functional groups, satisfying complexity. It is supported by data points such as high yield with octanoic acid and low yields with 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid, demonstrating strong coverage.**

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8 states that modifiers containing ether linkages and carboxylic acid groups result in low yield. The rationale explains that ether oxygens are poor ligands compared to carboxylates and may not coordinate effectively with metal centers, reducing catalytic activity. The rule combines the presence of ether linkages with carboxylic acid groups, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points like low yield with 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, indicating adequate coverage.**

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9 specifies that modifiers with heavily fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield. The rationale provides physicochemical insight into how the high electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorinated chains impede interaction with the catalyst. While the rule is clear, it is based on a limited number of data points (e.g., low yield with 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), which may affect coverage. The rule focuses on a specific structural feature without combining multiple substructures, slightly limiting its complexity.**

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10 distinguishes between amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms (resulting in low yield) and those with side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination (resulting in high yield). The rationale provides insight into how bulky hydrophobic side chains can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst, whereas heteroatoms enhance coordination. The rule combines considerations of side chain properties with amino acid structure, satisfying complexity. It is supported by data points such as low yields with (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine) and high yield with (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan), indicating acceptable coverage.**

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11 states that modifiers containing amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield. The rationale suggests that amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for coordination sites or alter the geometry required for effective catalyst interaction. The rule combines the presence of amide linkages with carboxylic acid groups, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points such as low yields with 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid and 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, demonstrating adequate coverage.**

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12 specifies that modifiers with aromatic rings bearing multiple methoxy groups and a ketone in the aliphatic chain result in high yield. The rationale provides insight into how electron-donating methoxy groups increase electron density and how the ketone can participate in coordination, enhancing catalytic activity. The rule combines multiple structural features—aromatic methoxy groups and aliphatic ketone—fulfilling the complexity criterion. However, coverage may be limited as it appears to be based on a single data point (high yield with 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), potentially affecting robustness.**

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13 indicates that modifiers with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups on long aliphatic chains (more than five carbons) result in low yield. The rationale explains that these polar terminal groups increase solubility in the reaction medium and may interfere with catalyst interactions or reduce effective coordination. The rule combines considerations of chain length and terminal functional groups, satisfying complexity. It is supported by multiple data points such as low yields with 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid, demonstrating strong coverage.**

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14 states that modifiers with electron-donating alkyl groups on aromatic carboxylic acids result in low yield. The rationale explains that electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylic acid, reducing interaction with the catalyst. The rule combines the presence of electron-donating substituents with aromatic carboxylic acids, satisfying complexity. Coverage is acceptable but somewhat limited, primarily supported by data showing low yield with 4-methylbenzoic acid.**

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15 asserts that modifiers containing multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxylate) in configurations that promote chelation to the metal center result in high yield. The rationale highlights how chelation increases the stability of the modifier-metal complex, enhancing catalytic efficiency through stronger and multidentate coordination. The rule is complex, considering multiple functional groups and their spatial arrangement. It is supported by data points such as high yields with (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid) and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, indicating good coverage.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, halogens like bromo) result in high yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**  
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**  
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating methyl group)  
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (aldehyde group)  
  **Rationale**: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers enhance interaction with the catalyst, increasing the yield. Electron-withdrawing groups also increase acidity, improving coordination.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids or aminocarboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; longer chains result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)  
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)  
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**  
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Short-chain amino acids effectively coordinate with metal centers due to minimal steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity. Longer chains may hinder coordination due to increased flexibility and steric effects.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde substituents result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**  
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or reduce the electron density available for coordination, hindering effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Niacin)  
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**  
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Nitrogen heterocycles coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen atom, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in high yield; aromatic thiol-containing acids result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with metal centers without the steric and electronic delocalization present in aromatic systems.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)  
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance through stronger coordination.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield; addition of polar groups leads to low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **Octanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (hydroxyl group)  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (amino group)  
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Unsubstituted long-chain fatty acids interact hydrophobically with the catalyst matrix, improving stability. Polar functional groups may interfere with catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages and carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**  
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are poor ligands compared to carboxylates and may not coordinate effectively with metal centers, reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with heavily fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can impede interaction with the catalyst and decrease yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in low yield; side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination result in high yield.**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)  
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (N-Acetyllysine)  
  Example (High Yield):  
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)  
  **Rationale**: Bulky hydrophobic side chains without coordinating groups hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. Heteroatoms in side chains can enhance coordination.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**  
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for coordination sites or alter the geometry needed for effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings bearing multiple methoxy groups and a ketone in the aliphatic chain result in high yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Electron-donating methoxy groups increase electron density, and the ketone can participate in coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups on long aliphatic chains (more than five carbons) result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**  
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Polar terminal groups increase solubility in the reaction medium and may interfere with catalyst interactions or reduce effective coordination.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with electron-donating alkyl groups on aromatic carboxylic acids result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylic acid, reducing interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxylate) in configurations that promote chelation to the metal center result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)  
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Chelation increases the stability of the modifier-metal complex, enhancing catalytic efficiency through stronger and multidentate coordination.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Adjust Rule 1's SMARTS pattern to accurately match para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups, including halogens like bromo.** The current pattern `[c][c]([c][c][c][N,O,F,Cl,Br,I])[C](=O)[O;H1]` may not correctly identify halogen substituents at the para position. Consider revising the pattern to ensure it matches any para-substituted group capable of coordination, such as `[c]1[c][c][c][c]([N,O,F,Cl,Br,I])[c]1C(=O)O`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Modify Rule 6 to prevent carboxylic acid hydroxyls from being counted as aliphatic hydroxyl groups.** The current implementation may miscount the hydroxyl in the carboxylic acid group `[CX3](=O)[O;H1]` as part of the hydroxyl count. Update the SMARTS pattern for hydroxyl groups to `[#6][OX2H;$([OX2H][#6;!$(C=O)])]`, ensuring only aliphatic hydroxyls not attached to carboxyl groups are counted.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Correct the implementation of Rule 10 to ensure that amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (like tryptophan) are assigned a high yield prediction.** The code may not be properly evaluating alternative patterns. Verify that the `alternative_patterns` are being checked when the primary patterns match and correctly assign the `alternative_prediction`. Ensure that the pattern for side chains with heteroatoms, such as `[CX4][c][n]`, correctly matches compounds like tryptophan.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Enhance Rule 2's implementation to accurately calculate the carbon chain length and assign predictions accordingly.** The current method may not correctly determine the chain length of amino acids, particularly when distinguishing between chains longer than five carbons. Implement a function to calculate the longest carbon backbone path and use it to assign `prediction` or `alternative_prediction` based on the chain length.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Refine Rule 8 to ensure that only modifiers containing ether linkages are assigned a low yield prediction.** Some molecules without ether linkages may be incorrectly matched due to broad SMARTS patterns. Adjust the ether linkage pattern to `[#6]-O-[#6;!$(O-[#6]=O)]`, ensuring it specifically matches ether groups and excludes other oxygen-containing functionalities.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Adjust Rule 15 to prevent molecules that should result in low yield (like phenylalanine) from being incorrectly assigned a high yield prediction due to multiple coordinating groups.** Incorporate checks for disqualifying features, such as bulky hydrophobic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms, by adding `exclude_patterns` or modifying the conditions under which `prediction` is assigned.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Improve substructure matching by using recursive SMARTS patterns and additional atom properties to accurately identify functional groups.** This can help distinguish between similar substructures and ensure that only the intended functional groups are matched. For example, specify atom hybridization or the absence of neighboring functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Include explicit positional checks in SMARTS patterns to differentiate between ortho, meta, and para substitutions on aromatic rings.** This will ensure accurate matching of substituent positions as per the natural language rules. For instance, use patterns like `c1cc([N,O,F,Cl,Br,I])ccc1C(=O)O` for para-substituted benzoic acids.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Implement unit tests for each rule using the provided examples to validate that the code correctly identifies matches and assigns predictions.** This will help catch errors in SMARTS patterns or logic and ensure that each rule functions as intended.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Ensure that when both `patterns` and `alternative_patterns` are specified in a rule, the code correctly checks `alternative_patterns` when `patterns` do not result in a match, and assigns `alternative_prediction` accordingly.** Modify the code logic to handle this properly and avoid defaulting to zero when an alternative prediction is applicable.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, halogens like bromo) result in high yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**  
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**  
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating methyl group)  
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (aldehyde group)  
  **Rationale**: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers enhance interaction with the catalyst, increasing the yield. Electron-withdrawing groups also increase acidity, improving coordination.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids or aminocarboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; longer chains result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)  
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)  
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**  
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Short-chain amino acids effectively coordinate with metal centers due to minimal steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity. Longer chains may hinder coordination due to increased flexibility and steric effects.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde substituents result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**  
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or reduce the electron density available for coordination, hindering effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Niacin)  
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**  
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Nitrogen heterocycles coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen atom, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in high yield; aromatic thiol-containing acids result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with metal centers without the steric and electronic delocalization present in aromatic systems.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)  
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance through stronger coordination.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield; addition of polar groups leads to low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **Octanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (hydroxyl group)  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (amino group)  
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Unsubstituted long-chain fatty acids interact hydrophobically with the catalyst matrix, improving stability. Polar functional groups may interfere with catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages and carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**  
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are poor ligands compared to carboxylates and may not coordinate effectively with metal centers, reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with heavily fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can impede interaction with the catalyst and decrease yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in low yield; side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination result in high yield.**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)  
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (N-Acetyllysine)  
  Example (High Yield):  
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)  
  **Rationale**: Bulky hydrophobic side chains without coordinating groups hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. Heteroatoms in side chains can enhance coordination.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**  
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for coordination sites or alter the geometry needed for effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings bearing multiple methoxy groups and a ketone in the aliphatic chain result in high yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Electron-donating methoxy groups increase electron density, and the ketone can participate in coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups on long aliphatic chains (more than five carbons) result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**  
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Polar terminal groups increase solubility in the reaction medium and may interfere with catalyst interactions or reduce effective coordination.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with electron-donating alkyl groups on aromatic carboxylic acids result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylic acid, reducing interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxylate) in configurations that promote chelation to the metal center result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)  
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Chelation increases the stability of the modifier-metal complex, enhancing catalytic efficiency through stronger and multidentate coordination.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **For Rule 1**, the SMARTS pattern `'c1ccc([N,O,F,Cl,Br,I])cc1C(=O)[O;H1]'` does not accurately capture the substituents like amino (`-NH₂`) and nitro (`-NO₂`) groups, as these are not single atoms but groups. Modify the SMARTS to include substituents capable of coordination, such as amino groups (`'[NX3;H2]'`), nitro groups (`'[N+](=O)[O-]'`), and halogens (`'[F,Cl,Br,I]'`) attached at the para position. Consider using patterns like `'c1ccc([NX3;H2,F,Cl,Br,I])cc1C(=O)[O;H1]'` and `'c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1C(=O)[O;H1]'` to match these groups accurately.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **For Rule 2**, the method to calculate the longest carbon chain from the amino group may not be reliable. Instead of a custom DFS function, use established cheminformatics functions like `Chem.rdmolops.GetShortestPath` or `Chem.GetDistanceMatrix` to determine chain lengths more accurately. Also, ensure that the SMARTS patterns for amino acids correctly match both D- and L-amino acids.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **For Rule 3**, the SMARTS pattern `'c1ccc(C=O)cc1C(=O)[O;H1]'` may only match aldehyde substitutions at a specific position. Modify it to allow the aldehyde group at any position on the ring, for example, `'c[c](C=O)[c][c][c][c]C(=O)[O;H1]'` or use a recursive SMARTS to match any aromatic ring with both an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid group.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **For Rule 4**, the pattern `'[nH]1cccc1C(=O)[O;H1]'` only matches heterocycles with a protonated nitrogen. To include all nitrogen heterocycles (both protonated and unprotonated), adjust the SMARTS to `'n1cccc1C(=O)[O;H1]'` so that it matches any nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycle with a carboxylic acid group.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **For Rule 5**, ensure that the SMARTS pattern for aliphatic thiols (`'[CX4][SX2H]'`) correctly distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic thiols. Verify that the exclude pattern (`'[c][SX2H]'`) effectively excludes aromatic thiols. Test the patterns on example molecules to confirm they behave as expected.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **For Rule 6**, the hydroxyl pattern `'[#6][OX2H;$([OX2H][#6;!$(C=O)])]'` may not correctly match multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain. Consider using a pattern like `'[CX4H,CH2][OX2H]'` to match hydroxyl groups attached to sp³ carbons and adjust the counting mechanism to ensure it counts the number of hydroxyl groups correctly.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **For Rule 7**, the `{6,}` repetition syntax in the SMARTS pattern `'[CH3][CH2]{6,}[CX3](=O)[O;H1,O-]'` may not be supported by all cheminformatics libraries. Replace it with an explicit pattern or use recursive SMARTS. Alternatively, generate patterns for specific chain lengths or use the `AllChem.GetMolFrags` function to determine chain lengths programmatically.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **For Rule 10**, the side chain patterns (`'[CX4][c]'`) may not adequately represent bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms. Expand the patterns to include other bulky hydrophobic groups, such as isopropyl or tert-butyl groups (`'[CX4][CX3](C)C'`) and ensure that the exclude patterns accurately remove side chains with coordinating heteroatoms.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **For Rule 15**, when counting coordinating functional groups, ensure that overlapping matches are not counted multiple times. Use `GetSubstructMatches` with the `uniquify=False` parameter carefully, or consider using atom tags or flags to prevent double-counting. Also, verify that the exclude patterns do not inadvertently exclude molecules that should match according to the rule.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Overall**, review all SMARTS patterns for syntax errors and ensure compatibility with the chosen cheminformatics toolkit (e.g., RDKit). Test each pattern individually against known molecules to confirm they correctly identify the intended structures. Consider adding unit tests for each rule to validate the patterns.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, halogens like bromo) result in high yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**  
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**  
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating methyl group)  
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (aldehyde group)  
  **Rationale**: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers enhance interaction with the catalyst, increasing the yield. Electron-withdrawing groups also increase acidity, improving coordination.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids or aminocarboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; longer chains result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)  
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)  
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**  
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Short-chain amino acids effectively coordinate with metal centers due to minimal steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity. Longer chains may hinder coordination due to increased flexibility and steric effects.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde substituents result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**  
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or reduce the electron density available for coordination, hindering effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Niacin)  
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**  
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Nitrogen heterocycles coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen atom, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in high yield; aromatic thiol-containing acids result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with metal centers without the steric and electronic delocalization present in aromatic systems.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)  
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance through stronger coordination.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield; addition of polar groups leads to low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **Octanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (hydroxyl group)  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (amino group)  
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Unsubstituted long-chain fatty acids interact hydrophobically with the catalyst matrix, improving stability. Polar functional groups may interfere with catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages and carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**  
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are poor ligands compared to carboxylates and may not coordinate effectively with metal centers, reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with heavily fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can impede interaction with the catalyst and decrease yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in low yield; side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination result in high yield.**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)  
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (N-Acetyllysine)  
  Example (High Yield):  
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)  
  **Rationale**: Bulky hydrophobic side chains without coordinating groups hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. Heteroatoms in side chains can enhance coordination.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**  
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for coordination sites or alter the geometry needed for effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings bearing multiple methoxy groups and a ketone in the aliphatic chain result in high yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Electron-donating methoxy groups increase electron density, and the ketone can participate in coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups on long aliphatic chains (more than five carbons) result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**  
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Polar terminal groups increase solubility in the reaction medium and may interfere with catalyst interactions or reduce effective coordination.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with electron-donating alkyl groups on aromatic carboxylic acids result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylic acid, reducing interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxylate) in configurations that promote chelation to the metal center result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)  
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Chelation increases the stability of the modifier-metal complex, enhancing catalytic efficiency through stronger and multidentate coordination.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: In **Rule 2**, the code for determining the chain length of amino acids is not accurate. The current code uses distance matrices and may not correctly calculate the chain length, especially in branched chains or rings. Instead, modify the code to calculate the shortest carbon chain between the amino nitrogen and the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon, counting only the carbon atoms in the backbone. Use RDKit's `GetShortestPath` method to find the path and count the number of carbons to ensure accurate chain length calculation.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: In **Rule 2**, the SMARTS patterns used may not accurately match aliphatic amino acids. The current pattern `'[NX3;H2][CX4]'` matches any primary amine attached to an aliphatic carbon but doesn't ensure the presence of both amino and carboxylic acid groups on the same chain. Modify the SMARTS pattern to specifically match amino acids: `'[NX3;H2][CX4][CX2H1][CX3](=O)[O;H1,O-]'`, ensuring the amine and carboxylic acid are connected via an aliphatic chain.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 6**, the code checks for multiple hydroxyl groups but doesn't ensure they are on an aliphatic chain. The code should specify that hydroxyl groups are attached to adjacent carbons in an aliphatic chain. Modify the SMARTS pattern to `'[CX4;!$(C=[O,N,S])][OX2H]'` and ensure that multiple such patterns are connected in a chain.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: In **Rule 7**, the method for determining the chain length and presence of polar groups may not account for branching or cycles. Instead, use RDKit's `AllChem.CalcMolFormula` and `Chem.rdmolops.GetSSSR` methods to ensure the chain is linear and acyclic. Use the `Chem.FragmentOnBonds` method to break cycles if needed and accurately determine the longest linear carbon chain.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: In **Rule 10**, the `bulky_side_chains` patterns may not comprehensively cover all bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms. Expand these patterns to include side chains like isobutyl (leucine), isopropyl (valine), and others. Adjust the `exclude_patterns` to include heteroatom-containing side chains more effectively by using patterns like `'[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1-][#6][CX4][NX3;!H0]'` to exclude amino acids with coordinating side chains.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For **Rule 13**, the SMARTS pattern `'[CH3][CH2]{5,}[OX2H,NX3;H2]'` may not match branched chains or rings correctly. Instead, implement a method to identify terminal hydroxyl or amino groups on long aliphatic chains by calculating the chain length between the functional group and the carboxylic acid, ensuring it exceeds five carbons. Use recursive SMARTS or path calculations to achieve this.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For rules involving counts of functional groups, such as **Rule 6** and **Rule 15**, use RDKit's `GetSubstructMatches` with `uniquify=True` and ensure counts are accurate. For example, in **Rule 15**, confirm that coordinating groups are in positions that allow chelation by checking their relative positions in the molecule.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: In **Rule 5**, the `exclude_patterns` may not sufficiently exclude aromatic thiol-containing acids. Replace `'[c][SX2H]'` with a more comprehensive pattern like `'c[SX2H]'` which ensures the thiol is directly attached to an aromatic system. Similarly, ensure aliphatic thiols are correctly identified.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For **Rule 7**, improve the exclusion of polar groups by expanding the `exclude_patterns` to include other polar functional groups like ketones (`'[CX3](=O)[#6]'`), aldehydes, and ethers. This will ensure that only unsubstituted long-chain fatty acids are matched.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Test all SMARTS patterns against a diverse set of example SMILES, both positive and negative, for each rule. This will help validate the accuracy of the patterns and highlight any mismatches or unintended matches. Adjust the SMARTS patterns based on testing results to ensure they accurately reflect the natural language rules.

Metric Calculator Message:

    Train support: 0.1657142857142857
    Train confidence: 0.564973544973545
    Train lift: 1.1248366013071895
    Train leverage: 0.004462585034013608
    -------------------------------------------------------

    
---------------------------------------------------------------
Metric Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Performance of the Current Rules Based on the Current Metrics**

After analyzing the current rule metrics and comparing them with the reference metrics from previous iterations, we observe the following:

---

**1. Train Support**

- **Previous Mean Support:**  
  \[(0.1667 + 0.1845) / 2 = 0.1756\]
  
- **Current Support:**  
  \(0.1657\)

- **Analysis:**  
  The current train support is slightly lower than the previous mean support. Train support reflects the proportion of records for which both the rule conditions and the predictions are true. A support value of approximately 0.1657 indicates that 16.57% of the training data fits the rules entirely, which is slightly less than the previous average of 17.56%. This minor decrease suggests that the current rules cover a similar portion of the dataset compared to previous iterations.

---

**2. Train Confidence**

- **Previous Mean Confidence:**  
  \[(0.6352 + 0.5396) / 2 = 0.5874\]
  
- **Current Confidence:**  
  \(0.5650\)

- **Analysis:**  
  The train confidence has decreased from the previous mean of 58.74% to 56.50%. Confidence measures the proportion of cases where the rule predictions are correct among all cases where the rule conditions are met. This slight decline indicates that the current rules are marginally less reliable in making accurate predictions based on the conditions specified.

---

**3. Train Lift**

- **Previous Mean Lift:**  
  \[(1.2048 + 1.0559) / 2 = 1.1304\]
  
- **Current Lift:**  
  \(1.1248\)

- **Analysis:**  
  The lift remains relatively consistent with a minimal decrease from 1.1304 to 1.1248. A lift greater than 1 suggests that the rule is useful in predicting the outcome better than random chance. The current lift value indicates that the rules still hold predictive value, though there has been no significant improvement over previous iterations.

---

**4. Train Leverage**

- **Previous Mean Leverage:**  
  \[(0.0289 + (-0.0041)) / 2 = 0.0124\]
  
- **Current Leverage:**  
  \(0.0045\)

- **Analysis:**  
  The train leverage has decreased from an average of 0.0124 to 0.0045. Leverage measures the difference between the observed support and the expected support if the items were independent. A lower leverage indicates a weaker association between the rule conditions and the predictions beyond what would be expected by chance. This suggests that the current rules contribute less additional predictive power compared to previous rules.

---

**Conclusions on Local Minimum and Iterations**

Based on the comparison:

- **Marginal Changes:** The metrics show marginal changes compared to the previous iteration, with slight decreases in support, confidence, lift, and leverage.
  
- **Plateauing Performance:** The minimal differences suggest that the performance of the rules is plateauing. There is no significant improvement, and in some aspects, there is a slight decline.

- **Local Minimum:** The plateau in performance metrics indicates that a local minimum may have been reached. Continuing with the same approach and expecting different results might not be efficient at this point.

- **Sufficiency of Iterations:** Given that successive iterations are not yielding substantial improvements, it may be appropriate to consider that enough iterations have been conducted with the current methodology.

---

**Suggestions for Improving the Current Rules After Detailed Analysis**

To enhance the performance of the rules and potentially overcome the local minimum, consider the following strategies:

**1. Re-examine the Rule Set for Redundancies and Conflicts**

- **Identify Redundant Rules:**  
  Some rules may overlap or predict similar outcomes based on similar conditions (e.g., Rules 2, 7, and 13 all deal with aliphatic chain length and presence of functional groups). Consolidating these rules could increase support and potentially improve confidence.

- **Resolve Conflicting Rules:**  
  Ensure that rules do not contradict each other. For instance, Rules 2 and 13 both address aliphatic amino acids with varying chain lengths but may offer conflicting predictions for certain compounds.

**2. Adjust the Specificity and Generality of Rules**

- **Balance Generality and Specificity:**  
  Rules that are too specific may have high confidence but low support, while overly general rules may have high support but low confidence.

- **Example:**  
  - **Rule 9** (Modifiers with heavily fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield) is highly specific and may have low support.
  - **Suggestion:** Broaden this rule to include other electron-withdrawing groups or consider integrating it into a more general rule about electronegative substituents.

**3. Incorporate Additional Chemical Insights**

- **Leverage Chemical Properties:**  
  Utilize chemical properties such as electronegativity, steric hindrance, and coordination chemistry to refine rules. For example, consider the overall electron density, hard and soft acid-base interactions, or the impact of pKa values on coordination.

- **Re-evaluate Functional Group Effects:**  
  Assess whether certain functional groups consistently influence yield and revise rules accordingly.

**4. Enhance Feature Engineering**

- **Create New Descriptors:**  
  Develop additional descriptors or features that capture relevant chemical information, such as molecular orbital interactions, solubility parameters, or three-dimensional structures.

- **Use Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR):**  
  Incorporate QSAR modeling to quantitatively relate chemical structure to catalytic activity, potentially uncovering patterns not evident through rule-based methods.

**5. Explore Alternative Modeling Approaches**

- **Machine Learning Techniques:**  
  Employ machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests, support vector machines) to discover complex, non-linear relationships that may be missed by manual rule generation.

- **Cluster Analysis:**  
  Use clustering to identify groups of modifiers with similar properties and performance, which can inform the creation of more effective rules.

**6. Validate and Test the Rules with New Data**

- **Gather Additional Data:**  
  Obtain more experimental data to test the rules, providing a better assessment of their generalizability and robustness.

- **Cross-Validation:**  
  Implement cross-validation techniques to evaluate rule performance and prevent overfitting to the training data.

**7. Reassess the Rule Evaluation Metrics**

- **Focus on Statistically Significant Improvements:**  
  Assess whether changes in metrics are statistically significant. Minor fluctuations may not represent meaningful differences.

- **Prioritize Metrics Based on Goals:**  
  Determine which metrics align best with the objectives of the research. If high confidence is crucial, focus on improving that metric even if it means sacrificing some support.

---

**Final Thoughts**

The current analysis indicates that the existing set of rules, while reasonable, may have reached their maximum effectiveness under the current framework. To achieve further improvements:

- **Innovate in Rule Development:**  
  Break away from existing patterns and consider novel approaches to rule generation.

- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:**  
  Collaborate with experts in catalysis, computational chemistry, and data science to integrate diverse perspectives and expertise.

- **Iterative Refinement:**  
  Adopt an iterative process of rule development, testing, and refinement, continuously incorporating feedback from both metric evaluations and domain knowledge.

By implementing these strategies, it is possible to enhance the performance of the rules, gain deeper insights into the catalytic problem, and ultimately contribute more effectively to the research program.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Comments on the Accuracies**

The model's performance has decreased compared to previous iterations. In prior runs, the validation accuracies were consistently around **76%**, with test accuracies ranging from **62.5% to 75%**. Specifically:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies**: `[0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]`
- **Previous Test Accuracies**: `0.625` to `0.75`

In the current iteration:

- **Current 5-Fold Validation Accuracy**: **51.43%**
  
This significant drop in accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be effectively capturing the underlying patterns in the data. The decrease indicates potential issues such as underfitting, where the model fails to capture the complexity of the data, or the rules may not generalize well to unseen data.

**2. Analysis Based on SHAP Values**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions for each molecule. By examining the SHAP values, we can identify which rules are influencing the predictions, especially in cases where the model's predictions do not align with experimental values.

**Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low)**

For molecules where the model predicts a high loading but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values contribute to the overestimation. Key observations include:

- **Molecule**: `C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`
  - **Predicted Loading**: High
  - **Experimental Loading**: Low
  - **Significant SHAP Values**:
    - **Rule 2**: **+0.3016**
    - **Rule 11**: **+0.0604**

- **Molecule**: `C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O`
  - **Predicted Loading**: High
  - **Experimental Loading**: Low
  - **Significant SHAP Values**:
    - **Rule 15**: **+0.2239**
    - **Rule 11**: **+0.0123**
  
- **Molecule**: `COCCOCCOCC(=O)O`
  - **Predicted Loading**: High
  - **Experimental Loading**: Low
  - **Significant SHAP Values**:
    - **Rule 15**: **+0.2239**
    - **Rule 11**: **+0.0123**

**Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High)**

For molecules where the model predicts a low loading but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values are contributing to the underestimation:

- **Molecule**: `C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O`
  - **Predicted Loading**: Low
  - **Experimental Loading**: High
  - **Significant SHAP Values**:
    - **Rule 2**: **-0.0433**
    - **Rule 6**: **-0.0385**

- **Molecule**: `C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O`
  - **Predicted Loading**: Low
  - **Experimental Loading**: High
  - **Significant SHAP Values**:
    - **Rule 2**: **-0.0433**
    - **Rule 6**: **-0.0385**

**Key Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule 2**: Significant positive SHAP values in overestimations and negative SHAP values in underestimations suggest that **Rule 2** may be overemphasizing certain molecular features, leading to incorrect predictions.

- **Rule 6**: Negative SHAP values in cases of underestimated loading indicate that **Rule 6** may be suppressing predictions where it should not, potentially due to overly restrictive conditions.

- **Rule 15**: High positive SHAP values in overestimations imply that **Rule 15** may be contributing to false positives, possibly because its criteria are too broad.

**3. Evaluation of Current Rules**

**Effectiveness of Current Rules**

The current rules appear to be less effective than in previous iterations, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy. The rules may not be adequately capturing the nuances of the molecular structures or their interactions with the catalyst.

**Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment**

- **Underfitting**: The significant drop in accuracy and inability to correctly predict loadings suggest that the model may be underfitting. This is indicative of rules that are too simplistic or not sufficiently representative of the underlying chemistry.

- **Overfitting**: The consistent mispredictions in certain areas may also point to overfitting on specific features, where the rules are tailored too closely to particular examples without generalizing well.

**Discrepancies Analysis**

- **Overestimations**: Predicted high loading with low experimental value indicates that some rules are over-contributing to the prediction. Rules with high positive SHAP values in these cases need reassessment.

- **Underestimations**: Predicted low loading with high experimental value suggests that some rules are penalizing the prediction too heavily. Rules with high negative SHAP values in these instances should be adjusted.

**4. Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can help improve the current rules and model performance:

**a. Refine Rule 2**

- **Issue**: Rule 2 is contributing significantly to both overestimations and underestimations.
  
- **Current Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids or aminocarboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; longer chains result in low yield.*

- **Recommendation**:
  - **Reassess the Chain Length Criterion**: The strict cutoff at five carbons may be too arbitrary. Consider expanding the acceptable chain length or incorporating additional factors such as side chain functionality.
  - **Include Side Chain Effects**: Recognize that side chains with coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) can influence the yield regardless of chain length.
  - **Modify Rule**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids or aminocarboxylic acids with chain lengths of up to seven carbons and contain side chains with coordinating groups result in high yield.*

**b. Adjust Rule 6**

- **Issue**: Rule 6's negative SHAP values in underestimations suggest it's penalizing molecules that should result in high yield.

- **Current Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield.*

- **Recommendation**:
  - **Broaden the Scope**: Consider including molecules with aromatic rings bearing hydroxyl groups if they can facilitate chelation.
  - **Clarify the Functional Group Configuration**: Specify the positions and number of hydroxyl groups necessary for high yield.
  - **Modify Rule**: *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with two or more hydroxyl groups capable of chelation, whether on aliphatic or aromatic systems, result in high yield.*

**c. Reevaluate Rule 15**

- **Issue**: Rule 15 is contributing to overestimations due to high positive SHAP values in cases where the experimental yield is low.

- **Current Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxylate) in configurations that promote chelation to the metal center result in high yield.*

- **Recommendation**:
  - **Introduce Specificity**: The rule may be too broad, capturing molecules that do not actually contribute to high yield.
  - **Define Configurations**: Specify the spatial arrangement or the need for multidentate ligands.
  - **Modify Rule**: *Modifiers that contain multiple coordinating functional groups in specific configurations that have been shown to effectively chelate the metal center (e.g., bidentate or tridentate chelators with optimal spatial orientation) result in high yield.*

**d. Address Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Improve Generalization**:
  - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: Rules that are too specific may overfit to the training data. Ensure that rules are based on fundamental chemical principles that generalize across different molecules.
  - **Combine Similar Rules**: Rules that overlap significantly may be merged for simplicity and to reduce redundancy.

**e. Incorporate Additional Chemical Insights**

- **Consider Electronic Effects**: Include rules that account for electron-donating or withdrawing effects of substituents on aromatic rings, as they influence acidity and coordination ability.

- **Evaluate Steric Hindrance**: Modify rules to consider steric factors that may hinder coordination, especially in bulky molecules.

**f. Utilize SHAP Insights Iteratively**

- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously use SHAP analysis after each iteration to identify which rules contribute to mispredictions and adjust them accordingly.

- **Threshold Setting**: Set thresholds for SHAP value contributions to identify significant rules for modification.

**Conclusion**

By refining the problematic rules identified through SHAP analysis, particularly Rules 2, 6, and 15, and ensuring that the rules are neither too broad nor too restrictive, we can enhance the model's ability to accurately predict the catalyst modifier loading. Incorporating additional chemical insights and continuously iterating based on SHAP feedback will help in converging towards a more accurate and generalizable set of rules.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The recent analysis of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols has revealed that the current set of rules governing the selection of molecular modifiers can be further optimized to improve the yield. The key points from the discussions are as follows:

**Performance Metrics Overview**

- **Train Support and Confidence**: The current train support is approximately **16.57%**, slightly lower than the previous average, indicating that the rules cover a similar portion of the dataset. The train confidence is **56.50%**, a slight decrease from the previous mean, suggesting marginally less reliability in predictions.
  
- **Train Lift and Leverage**: The train lift is **1.1248**, consistent with previous values, indicating that the rules still hold predictive value. However, the train leverage decreased to **0.0045**, suggesting a weaker association between the rule conditions and predictions compared to previous iterations.

- **Validation Accuracy**: The model's 5-fold validation accuracy has significantly dropped to **51.43%**, down from consistent previous accuracies of around **76%**. This decrease suggests that the current rules may not be effectively capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

**SHAP Analysis Insights**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis highlighted several issues:

- **Overestimations**: Some rules are contributing to high predicted loadings when the experimental values are low. For example, **Rule 2** and **Rule 15** have high positive SHAP values in cases where the model overestimates the loading.

- **Underestimations**: In instances where the model predicts low loading but the experimental value is high, rules like **Rule 2** and **Rule 6** have significant negative SHAP values, indicating they may be overly penalizing certain molecular features.

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**

To enhance the predictive accuracy and effectiveness of the rules, the following key suggestions have been made:

1. **Refine Rule 2 (Chain Length of Amino Acids)**

   - **Issue**: The code for determining the chain length of amino acids is not accurately calculating the chain length, especially in branched chains or rings.

   - **Recommendation**:
     - Modify the method for calculating chain length by using RDKit's `GetShortestPath` function to find the shortest path between the amino nitrogen and the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon, counting only the backbone carbon atoms.
     - Adjust the SMARTS pattern to specifically match amino acids with both amino and carboxylic acid groups connected via an aliphatic chain, such as `'[NX3;H2][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[O;H1,O-]'`.

2. **Improve Specificity of SMARTS Patterns**

   - **Issue**: Several rules use SMARTS patterns that may not accurately match the intended functional groups, leading to incorrect classifications.

   - **Recommendation**:
     - For **Rule 6**, ensure that multiple hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons in an aliphatic chain by refining the SMARTS pattern to capture consecutive hydroxylated carbons.
     - In **Rule 8**, expand the SMARTS patterns to include other polar groups like ketones and aldehydes to better identify modifiers that should result in low yield.
     - For **Rule 10**, expand the patterns for bulky hydrophobic side chains to include more variations such as isobutyl and isopropyl groups, ensuring accurate identification of non-coordinating side chains.

3. **Clarify Functional Group Positions for Chelation (Rule 15)**

   - **Issue**: **Rule 15** may be too broad, leading to overestimations due to high positive SHAP values.

   - **Recommendation**:
     - Specify the spatial arrangement and positions of coordinating groups necessary for effective chelation.
     - Modify the rule to focus on multidentate ligands with optimal spatial orientations that have been shown to effectively chelate the metal center.

4. **Address Overlapping and Conflicting Rules**

   - **Issue**: Some rules may overlap or contradict each other, such as **Rules 2**, **7**, and **13**, which all address aliphatic chain lengths and functional groups.

   - **Recommendation**:
     - Re-examine the rules for redundancies and conflicts, merging similar rules where appropriate to increase support and confidence.
     - Ensure that the rules are consistent and do not produce contradictory predictions for the same modifiers.

5. **Incorporate Additional Chemical Insights**

   - **Issue**: The current rules may not fully capture the nuanced effects of molecular interactions with the catalyst.

   - **Recommendation**:
     - Utilize chemical properties such as steric hindrance, electronic effects, and hard-soft acid-base interactions to refine the rules.
     - Consider the role of pKa values, electron density, and the ability of functional groups to participate in coordination with the metal center.

6. **Enhance Feature Engineering**

   - **Issue**: The existing features may not sufficiently represent the modifiers' properties affecting the yield.

   - **Recommendation**:
     - Develop additional descriptors that capture relevant chemical information, such as molecular size, shape, and polarity.
     - Use quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) to model the relationship between chemical structure and catalytic activity.

7. **Test and Validate SMARTS Patterns**

   - **Issue**: Incorrect or overly broad SMARTS patterns can lead to erroneous classifications.

   - **Recommendation**:
     - Test all SMARTS patterns against a diverse set of example SMILES to validate their accuracy.
     - Adjust the patterns based on testing results to ensure they match the intended functional groups without capturing unintended ones.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Considering the significant decrease in validation accuracy and the insights gained from the SHAP analysis, there is room for further optimization of the current rules. The issues identified suggest that the current rules may be underfitting, failing to capture essential patterns in the data.

By refining the rules based on the suggestions above, especially through improving the specificity of SMARTS patterns and incorporating deeper chemical insights, we can enhance the model's performance without overfitting. Emphasizing chemical principles and ensuring that rules are neither too broad nor too restrictive will help in achieving better generalization.

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, halogens like bromo) result in high yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**  
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**  
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating methyl group)  
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (aldehyde group)  
  **Rationale**: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers enhance interaction with the catalyst, increasing the yield. Electron-withdrawing groups also increase acidity, improving coordination.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids or aminocarboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; longer chains result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)  
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)  
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**  
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Short-chain amino acids effectively coordinate with metal centers due to minimal steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity. Longer chains may hinder coordination due to increased flexibility and steric effects.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde substituents result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**  
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or reduce the electron density available for coordination, hindering effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Niacin)  
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**  
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Nitrogen heterocycles coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen atom, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in high yield; aromatic thiol-containing acids result in low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with metal centers without the steric and electronic delocalization present in aromatic systems.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)  
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance through stronger coordination.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield; addition of polar groups leads to low yield.**  
  Examples (High Yield):  
  - **Octanoic acid**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (hydroxyl group)  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (amino group)  
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Unsubstituted long-chain fatty acids interact hydrophobically with the catalyst matrix, improving stability. Polar functional groups may interfere with catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages and carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**  
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are poor ligands compared to carboxylates and may not coordinate effectively with metal centers, reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with heavily fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can impede interaction with the catalyst and decrease yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in low yield; side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination result in high yield.**  
  Examples (Low Yield):  
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)  
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (N-Acetyllysine)  
  Example (High Yield):  
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)  
  **Rationale**: Bulky hydrophobic side chains without coordinating groups hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. Heteroatoms in side chains can enhance coordination.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**  
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for coordination sites or alter the geometry needed for effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings bearing multiple methoxy groups and a ketone in the aliphatic chain result in high yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Electron-donating methoxy groups increase electron density, and the ketone can participate in coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups on long aliphatic chains (more than five carbons) result in low yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**  
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**  
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Polar terminal groups increase solubility in the reaction medium and may interfere with catalyst interactions or reduce effective coordination.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with electron-donating alkyl groups on aromatic carboxylic acids result in low yield.**  
  Example:  
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylic acid, reducing interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxylate) in configurations that promote chelation to the metal center result in high yield.**  
  Examples:  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)  
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**  
  **Rationale**: Chelation increases the stability of the modifier-metal complex, enhancing catalytic efficiency through stronger and multidentate coordination.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2 by Improving Chain Length Calculations and SMARTS Patterns**

  - **Issue**: The current method for determining the chain length of amino acids in Rule 2 is inaccurate, especially for branched chains or rings, leading to incorrect classifications and predictions.

  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Use RDKit's `GetShortestPath` Function**: Implement RDKit's `GetShortestPath` method to calculate the shortest path between the amino nitrogen (`N`) and the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon (`C`), counting only aliphatic backbone carbon atoms. This will provide an accurate measurement of the chain length regardless of branching.

    - **Adjust the SMARTS Pattern**:
      - **Current SMARTS**: The existing SMARTS pattern may not specifically capture short-chain aliphatic amino acids.
      - **Refined SMARTS Pattern**: Use a SMARTS pattern that matches amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer. Example:
        ```
        [NX3;H2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[O;H1]
        ```
        This pattern matches primary amines connected to a straight aliphatic chain of four carbons ending with a carboxylic acid group.

      - **Implementation**:
        - For chain lengths up to five carbons, adjust the pattern accordingly. For example, for three-carbon chains:
          ```
          [NX3;H2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[O;H1]
          ```

    - **Example Modifiers**:
      - **High Yield (Should Match)**:
        - **5-aminopentanoic acid**: Chain length of five carbons.
        - **4-aminobutanoic acid**: Chain length of four carbons.
      - **Low Yield (Should Not Match)**:
        - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**: Chain length exceeds five carbons.
        - **8-aminooctanoic acid**: Chain length exceeds five carbons.

- **Advice 2**: **Improve Specificity of SMARTS Patterns in Multiple Rules**

  - **Rule 6 (Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups)**:
    - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern may not ensure that the hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons in an aliphatic chain, leading to inaccurate matching.

    - **Recommendation**:
      - **Refined SMARTS Pattern**:
        ```
        [CX4;H2,O](O)[CX4;H2,O](O)[CX4;H2,O](O)[CX4][CX3](=O)[O;H1]
        ```
        This pattern matches aliphatic chains with at least three consecutive carbons bearing hydroxyl groups, adjacent to a carboxylic acid group.

      - **Example Modifiers**:
        - **High Yield (Should Match)**:
          - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
        - **Low Yield (Should Not Match)**:
          - Molecules where hydroxyl groups are not on adjacent carbons or are part of an aromatic ring.

  - **Rule 8 (Modifiers with Ether Linkages and Carboxylic Acid Groups)**:
    - **Issue**: The current rule may miss modifiers containing other polar groups like ketones and aldehydes, which can also lead to low yield.

    - **Recommendation**:
      - **Expand SMARTS Pattern**:
        ```
        [CX3](=O)[O;H1][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4]
        ```
        This pattern includes ether linkages in the chain adjacent to the carboxylic acid.

      - **Include Other Polar Groups**:
        - Modify the rule to account for ketones and aldehydes:
          ```
          [CX3](=O)[O;H1][CX4][CX3](=O)[CX4]
          ```
        - This captures modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid.

  - **Rule 10 (Modifiers with Bulky Hydrophobic Side Chains Lacking Coordinating Heteroatoms)**:
    - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern may not capture all bulky hydrophobic side chains, leading to misclassification.

    - **Recommendation**:
      - **Expand SMARTS Pattern**:
        ```
        [NX3;H2][CH2][CH](C)[CX3](=O)[O;H1]
        ```
        - This pattern matches amino acids like valine, leucine, and isoleucine with branched alkyl side chains.

      - **Include Aromatic Side Chains**:
        ```
        [NX3;H2][CH2][CH](c1ccccc1)[CX3](=O)[O;H1]
        ```
        - This captures amino acids like phenylalanine with aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms.

- **Advice 3**: **Clarify Functional Group Positions for Chelation in Rule 15**

  - **Issue**: Rule 15 may be too broad, causing overestimations due to high positive SHAP values.

  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Specify Spatial Arrangement of Donor Atoms**:
      - Focus on modifiers where coordinating groups are positioned to form stable chelate rings (five- or six-membered rings) with the metal center.

    - **Refined SMARTS Pattern**:
      ```
      [O;H1]-[C;H2]-[C;H2]-[N;H2]
      ```
      - This captures modifiers with hydroxyl and amino groups separated by two carbons, suitable for chelation.

    - **Example Modifiers**:
      - **High Yield (Should Match)**:
        - **2,3-dihydroxypropanoic acid** (Glyceric acid)
      - **Low Yield (Should Not Match)**:
        - Modifiers where coordinating groups are too far apart or sterically hindered.

- **Advice 4**: **Address Overlapping and Conflicting Rules**

  - **Issue**: Rules 2, 7, and 13 overlap and may conflict, all addressing aliphatic chain lengths and functional groups, leading to inconsistent predictions.

  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Merge Similar Rules**:
      - Combine Rules 2, 7, and 13 into a unified rule that accounts for chain length and the presence or absence of functional groups capable of coordination.

    - **Revised Rule**:
      - **Rule**: "Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer and contain coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) result in high yield; longer chains without coordinating groups result in low yield."

    - **Adjust SMARTS Patterns Accordingly**:
      - Use patterns that specifically capture the desired chain lengths and functional groups.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Additional Chemical Insights into the Rules**

  - **Issue**: Current rules may not fully capture the nuanced chemical interactions affecting yield.

  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Consider Steric Hindrance and Electronic Effects**:
      - Evaluate the size and electronic properties of substituents on the modifiers to determine their impact on coordination.

    - **Include Hard-Soft Acid-Base Interactions**:
      - Account for the metal center's preference for certain donor atoms based on hard-soft acid-base theory. For example, Fe(III) is a hard acid and prefers hard bases like oxygen donors.

    - **Adjust Rules Based on pKa Values**:
      - Modifiers with carboxylic acids of lower pKa may coordinate more effectively. Include rules that consider the acidity of functional groups.

- **Advice 6**: **Enhance Feature Engineering by Developing Additional Descriptors**

  - **Issue**: Existing features may not adequately represent the modifiers' properties affecting the yield.

  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Create Descriptors for Molecular Size and Shape**:
      - Calculate descriptors such as molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), and molecular volume.

    - **Assess Polarity and Electron Distribution**:
      - Include descriptors like the octanol-water partition coefficient (LogP) and electron density on coordinating atoms.

    - **Implement Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR)**:
      - Use QSAR modeling to identify correlations between chemical structures and yield, informing rule adjustments.

- **Advice 7**: **Test and Validate All SMARTS Patterns Thoroughly**

  - **Issue**: Incorrect or overly broad SMARTS patterns can lead to erroneous classifications.

  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Validate SMARTS Against Diverse SMILES**:
      - Test each SMARTS pattern with a variety of SMILES strings representing both matching and non-matching modifiers to ensure accuracy.

    - **Adjust Patterns Based on Testing Results**:
      - Refine patterns to eliminate false positives and negatives.

    - **Use RDKit Substructure Matching**:
      - Utilize RDKit's substructure search capabilities to confirm that the SMARTS patterns match the intended structures.

- **Advice 8**: **Review and Update Rule 14 (Electron-Donating Alkyl Groups on Aromatic Carboxylic Acids)**

  - **Issue**: Rule 14 may be too narrow, focusing only on alkyl groups, and not considering other electron-donating substituents that could decrease yield.

  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Expand Rule to Include Other Electron-Donating Groups**:
      - Include substituents like methoxy, ethoxy, and amino groups that are electron-donating and could reduce the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylic acid.

    - **Refined SMARTS Pattern**:
      ```
      c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[O;H1]
      ```
      - Combined with a condition that the aromatic ring has electron-donating substituents:
        ```
        [cH]-[c;$(c-[O,N])]  (aromatic carbon bonded to O or N)
        ```

    - **Example Modifiers**:
      - **Low Yield (Should Match)**:
        - **4-methoxybenzoic acid**
        - **4-dimethylaminobenzoic acid**

- **Advice 9**: **Eliminate Redundant or Ineffective Rules**

  - **Issue**: Some rules may not contribute significantly to the predictive power and may introduce noise.

  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Evaluate Each Rule's Performance Metrics**:
      - Use statistical analysis to determine the support, confidence, and lift of each rule.

    - **Remove or Modify Rules with Low Predictive Value**:
      - Eliminate rules that show low confidence and do not significantly improve model accuracy.

    - **Focus on High-Impact Rules**:
      - Prioritize rules that have strong statistical backing and clear chemical rationale.

- **Advice 10**: **Update Rule Descriptions for Clarity and Consistency**

  - **Issue**: Some rule descriptions may be ambiguous or lack sufficient detail, leading to misunderstanding during implementation.

  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Ensure Clear Definitions of Functional Groups and Terms**:
      - Define terms like "bulky," "long-chain," and "polar groups" quantitatively where possible.

    - **Provide Structural Examples**:
      - Include explicit molecular structures or SMILES strings alongside descriptors.

    - **Maintain Consistent Terminology**:
      - Use consistent chemical nomenclature throughout all rules for clarity.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents capable of coordination at the para position (such as amino or nitro groups) result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents (like alkyl or methoxy groups) result in low yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylic acid, enhancing interaction with the metal center and improving yield. Electron-donating groups decrease these properties, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids or aminodicarboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; longer chains without additional coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Short chains facilitate effective coordination with metal centers due to minimal steric hindrance. Longer aliphatic chains reduce coordination efficiency and catalytic performance.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (seven carbons or more) without additional polar functional groups result in high yield; introduction of polar groups like hydroxyl or amino leads to low yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **Octanoic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Unsubstituted long-chain acids enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst matrix, improving stability. Polar groups introduce steric and electronic interference with catalytic sites.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly connected to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield; if the heterocycle is substituted or not directly attached, the yield is low.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Niacin)
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles coordinate effectively with metal centers. Direct attachment maximizes this interaction, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to chelation; those with partial oxidation or ether linkages result in low yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups allow for multidentate coordination with metal centers, enhancing stability and reactivity. Ether linkages reduce coordinating ability and disrupt optimal interactions.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with electron-donating alkyl or methoxy groups on aromatic carboxylic acids result in low yield.**

  Examples:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordination potential of the carboxylic acid, weakening interaction with the catalyst and reducing yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or formyl substituents result in low yield due to potential side reactions and reduced coordination.**

  Examples:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or decrease the electron density available for coordination, hindering effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield.**

  Example:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Fluorination increases electronegativity and hydrophobicity, which can impede interaction with the catalyst's active sites, decreasing yield.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky, non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains result in low yield; presence of heteroatoms capable of coordination in side chains results in high yield.**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  **Rationale**: Side chains lacking coordinating groups do not contribute to metal binding and may introduce steric hindrance. Coordinating heteroatoms enhance metal interaction.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing sulfur atoms directly attached to aliphatic chains result in high yield; sulfur attached to aromatic rings results in low yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively with metal centers without the steric and electronic complications of aromatic systems.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield due to competition for coordination sites and altered geometry.**

  Examples:
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  **Rationale**: Amide groups can interfere with the carboxylate's ability to coordinate, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups and carbonyl functionalities result in high yield.**

  Example:
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Methoxy groups increase electron density, and carbonyl groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages and additional polar functional groups result in low yield due to reduced coordination efficiency and steric hindrance.**

  Example:
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weaker ligands, and additional polar groups may disrupt optimal metal-ligand interactions.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers possessing multiple functional groups capable of chelation (such as hydroxyl, amino, and carboxylate groups) in configurations that promote multidentate binding to metal centers result in high yield.**

  Examples:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Chelation enhances the stability of the metal-ligand complex, improving catalytic activity through stronger coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains without additional coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  Example:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  **Rationale**: The presence of ethers disrupts effective coordination due to their geometry and weaker donating ability compared to carboxylates and amines.

**End of Rules**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing para substituents result in high yield, while those with electron-donating groups result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight connecting electronic effects to coordination ability is strong. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, adding complexity, and is well-supported by multiple data points, satisfying coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly delineates that short-chain aliphatic amino acids (five carbons or fewer) with coordinating groups yield high performance, whereas longer chains without additional coordinating groups yield low performance. The rationale about steric hindrance and coordination efficiency provides solid physical-chemical insight. The rule combines chain length and functional groups, enhancing complexity, and is supported by sufficient data points.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 effectively states that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar groups lead to high yield, while introduction of polar groups decreases yield. The physical-chemical reasoning regarding hydrophobic interactions and steric interference is sound. The rule balances complexity and is supported by multiple data points, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in specifying that nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids result in high yield. The insight into coordination through nitrogen heteroatoms is accurate. It accounts for structural combinations, increasing complexity, and is backed by adequate data, fulfilling coverage criteria.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly indicates that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains lead to high yield due to chelation, while ethers and partially oxidized compounds result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight about multidentate coordination enhancing stability is strong. The rule is complex and supported by multiple data points.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 states that electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids result in low yield. While clear and supported by data, it overlaps with Rule 1, potentially reducing its unique contribution to complexity. The physical-chemical reasoning aligns with decreased acidity affecting coordination.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear about aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or formyl groups yielding low performance due to side reactions and reduced coordination. The physical-chemical insight is valid, and the rule has sufficient complexity and data support.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 specifies that fluorinated alkyl chains lead to low yield. While clear and providing reasonable insight into electronegativity effects, the rule has limited coverage with only one supporting data point, reducing its robustness.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly differentiates between amino acids with non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains (low yield) and those with coordinating heteroatoms (high yield). The physical-chemical insight is strong, considering the side chain's impact on metal binding. The rule is complex and well-supported by data.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 effectively distinguishes sulfur-containing modifiers based on their attachment, with aliphatic sulfurs yielding high performance and aromatic sulfurs yielding low performance. The physical-chemical rationale is sound. The rule adds complexity and is supported by data.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly states that modifiers with adjacent amide linkages result in low yield due to coordination interference. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, the rule has sufficient complexity, and it is supported by data, meeting coverage requirements.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 suggests that aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups and carbonyl functionalities result in high yield. While the rule provides clear guidance and reasonable insight, it is supported by limited data, affecting coverage and robustness.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 indicates that modifiers with ether linkages and additional polar groups result in low yield. The insight about reduced coordination efficiency is valid. However, the rule has limited coverage with few supporting data points, which may impact its general applicability.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 emphasizes that modifiers with multiple chelating functional groups in configurations promoting multidentate binding yield high performance. The physical-chemical insight is strong, the rule is complex, and it is well-supported by data, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 clearly states that ether linkages in aliphatic chains without coordinating groups lead to low yield. While the rule provides valid insight, it overlaps with Rule 13 and has limited data support, affecting its overall strength and coverage.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents capable of coordination at the para position (such as amino or nitro groups) result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents (like alkyl or methoxy groups) result in low yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylic acid, enhancing interaction with the metal center and improving yield. Electron-donating groups decrease these properties, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids or aminodicarboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; longer chains without additional coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Short chains facilitate effective coordination with metal centers due to minimal steric hindrance. Longer aliphatic chains reduce coordination efficiency and catalytic performance.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (seven carbons or more) without additional polar functional groups result in high yield; introduction of polar groups like hydroxyl or amino leads to low yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **Octanoic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Unsubstituted long-chain acids enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst matrix, improving stability. Polar groups introduce steric and electronic interference with catalytic sites.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly connected to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield; if the heterocycle is substituted or not directly attached, the yield is low.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Niacin)
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles coordinate effectively with metal centers. Direct attachment maximizes this interaction, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to chelation; those with partial oxidation or ether linkages result in low yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups allow for multidentate coordination with metal centers, enhancing stability and reactivity. Ether linkages reduce coordinating ability and disrupt optimal interactions.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with electron-donating alkyl or methoxy groups on aromatic carboxylic acids result in low yield.**

  Examples:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordination potential of the carboxylic acid, weakening interaction with the catalyst and reducing yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or formyl substituents result in low yield due to potential side reactions and reduced coordination.**

  Examples:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or decrease the electron density available for coordination, hindering effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield.**

  Example:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Fluorination increases electronegativity and hydrophobicity, which can impede interaction with the catalyst's active sites, decreasing yield.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky, non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains result in low yield; presence of heteroatoms capable of coordination in side chains results in high yield.**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  **Rationale**: Side chains lacking coordinating groups do not contribute to metal binding and may introduce steric hindrance. Coordinating heteroatoms enhance metal interaction.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing sulfur atoms directly attached to aliphatic chains result in high yield; sulfur attached to aromatic rings results in low yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively with metal centers without the steric and electronic complications of aromatic systems.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield due to competition for coordination sites and altered geometry.**

  Examples:
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  **Rationale**: Amide groups can interfere with the carboxylate's ability to coordinate, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups and carbonyl functionalities result in high yield.**

  Example:
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Methoxy groups increase electron density, and carbonyl groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages and additional polar functional groups result in low yield due to reduced coordination efficiency and steric hindrance.**

  Example:
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weaker ligands, and additional polar groups may disrupt optimal metal-ligand interactions.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers possessing multiple functional groups capable of chelation (such as hydroxyl, amino, and carboxylate groups) in configurations that promote multidentate binding to metal centers result in high yield.**

  Examples:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Chelation enhances the stability of the metal-ligand complex, improving catalytic activity through stronger coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains without additional coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  Example:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  **Rationale**: The presence of ethers disrupts effective coordination due to their geometry and weaker donating ability compared to carboxylates and amines.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Modify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 2 to accurately match short-chain aliphatic amino acids like 5-aminopentanoic acid.** The current pattern `aliphatic_amino_acid = '[NX3;H2][CX4H;!$(C=[O,N,S])][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[O;H1]'` is too restrictive and misses molecules where the amino group is not attached exactly as specified. A more general pattern like `'[NX3;H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX3](=O)[O;H1]'` would include primary amines attached to chains of variable lengths up to five carbons ending with a carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Adjust the logic and patterns for Rule 3 to correctly identify long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar functional groups.** The current implementation mistakenly assigns a low yield to octanoic acid (SMILES index 6). Ensure that the exclude patterns accurately detect the presence of polar groups and do not exclude molecules lacking them. Perhaps redefine the exclude patterns to `['[OX2H]', '[NX3;H2,H1]', '[SX2H]']` applied correctly within the code.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Update the SMARTS pattern for Rule 5 to capture molecules like gluconic acid that have multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain.** The existing pattern `'[CX4][OX2H][CX4][OX2H][CX4][OX2H][CX3](=O)[O;H1]'` is too specific. A recursive pattern such as `'[CX4;!$(C=O)](-[OX2H]){2,}.*[CX3](=O)[O;H1]'` can match aliphatic chains with two or more hydroxyl groups ending with a carboxylic acid, covering a broader range of relevant molecules.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Ensure Rule 6 correctly identifies aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups.** Verify that the SMARTS patterns for electron-donating groups (`edgs`) accurately match methoxy and alkyl-substituted benzoic acids. Adjust the patterns if necessary to include all positions on the aromatic ring and account for variations in substitution.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Implement additional rules not currently included, such as Rule 4, to enhance the feature matrix.** This will ensure that modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly connected to the carboxylic acid group are correctly identified and assigned high yield as per the natural language rules.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Refine the pattern matching logic to handle overlapping patterns and ensure mutually exclusive application where appropriate.** For example, in cases where a molecule could match both high-yield and low-yield patterns, define precedence or adjust the logic to prevent incorrect assignments.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Conduct unit testing for each rule with known positive and negative examples to validate the SMARTS patterns and logic.** Create a test suite that includes molecules from the examples provided in the natural language rules and additional compounds to confirm that the patterns match as intended.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Consider using cheminformatics libraries to generate substructure fingerprints or descriptors that can capture more complex patterns described in the rules.** This approach might provide a more robust way to encode the structural features influencing yield, especially for rules involving more complex coordination chemistry.

** End of Suggestions **

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rules Using Quantifiable Molecular Descriptors**  
  Reframe the current rules to focus on specific, quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For example, use counts of functional groups (e.g., number of hydroxyl groups, amino groups), chain lengths, and the presence of specific substructures. This will facilitate the generation of a numerical feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Similar Rules for Clarity and Efficiency**  
  Merge overlapping or redundant rules to simplify the rule set. For instance, combine Rules 6 and 7, which both involve electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids leading to low yield, and electron-withdrawing groups leading to high yield. This consolidation aids in creating a more streamlined feature extraction process.

- **Advice 3**: **Specify Chain Lengths with Exact Numbers**  
  Replace qualitative terms like "short-chain" and "long-chain" with specific carbon counts. For example, modify Rule 2 and Rule 3 to state: "Modifiers with aliphatic chains of 5 carbons or fewer result in high yield; chains longer than 5 carbons result in low yield unless they are unsubstituted." This precision allows for easy numerical encoding.

- **Advice 4**: **Utilize SMARTS Patterns for Functional Group Identification**

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating substituents at the para position (such as amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups) result in high yield; those with non-coordinating substituents result in low yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Substituents capable of coordinating with the metal center enhance catalytic activity by improving interaction between the modifier and the catalyst. Non-coordinating substituents do not aid in such interaction, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids or aminodicarboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; longer chains without additional coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Short chains with amino and carboxyl groups can effectively coordinate with metal centers due to proximal functional groups facilitating chelation. Longer chains with greater flexibility may result in less effective coordination.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids, where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocyclic ring, result in high yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  **Rationale**: The nitrogen in the heterocycle can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalytic properties. Direct attachment of the carboxylic acid to the heterocycle maximizes this interaction.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to chelation; those with single hydroxyl groups or ether linkages result in low yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups allow for multidentate coordination with metal centers, enhancing stability and reactivity. Ether linkages or single hydroxyl groups provide less effective coordination.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination result in high yield; those without coordinating heteroatoms result in low yield.**

  Examples (High Yield):
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  Examples (Low Yield):

  Examples (Low Yield):
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Unsubstituted long-chain acids enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst matrix, improving stability. Polar groups introduce steric and electronic interference with catalytic sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low yield due to competition for coordination sites and altered geometry.**

  Examples:
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  **Rationale**: Amide groups can interfere with the carboxylate's ability to coordinate, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups and carbonyl functionalities in the side chain result in high yield due to enhanced coordination capabilities.**

  Example:
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Methoxy groups increase electron density, and carbonyl groups in the side chain can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers possessing multiple functional groups capable of chelation (such as hydroxyl and carboxylate groups) in configurations that promote multidentate binding to metal centers result in high yield.**

  Example:
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

  **Rationale**: Chelation enhances the stability of the metal-ligand complex, improving catalytic activity through stronger coordination.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near coordinating groups that may hinder access to coordination sites result in low yield.**

  Example:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Develop Quantitative Structural Descriptors**: Update the rules to include specific structural descriptors that can be numerically quantified from the SMILES strings. For example, instead of qualitative terms like "short-chain" or "bulky aromatic side chains," define exact chain lengths (e.g., number of carbons), counts of specific functional groups (e.g., number of hydroxyl groups), or specific positions of substituents on aromatic rings (e.g., para, meta, ortho positions).

- **Advice 2**: **Create a Feature Matrix with Binary Indicators**: For each modifier, generate a binary feature vector indicating the presence or absence of key functional groups and structural features identified in the rules. This could include indicators for functional groups like amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl, nitro, thiol, ether linkages, and specific ring systems (e.g., pyridine ring).

- **Advice 3**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions**: Use standardized chemical definitions for functional groups and structures to ensure consistency. For instance, classify modifiers based on the presence of specific functional groups using SMARTS patterns, which can be directly applied to SMILES strings for automated feature extraction.

- **Advice 4**: **Quantify Steric and Electronic Parameters**: Incorporate numerical steric and electronic descriptors such as molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), and computed partial charges. These parameters can help correlate the steric hindrance and electronic effects mentioned in the rules with the reaction yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Include Molecular Geometry and Flexibility Indices**: Since chain length and flexibility impact yield, calculate molecular descriptors like the number of rotatable bonds or the flexibility index. This quantifies the effect of chain length and flexibility on coordination efficiency with the metal center.

- **Advice 6**: **Apply Substituent Constants**: Utilize Hammett sigma constants or Taft steric parameters for substituents on aromatic rings. These constants provide numerical values representing the electronic and steric effects of substituents, aiding in quantifying their influence on yield.

  - **Issue**: Rule 2 suggests that short-chain aliphatic amino acids with coordinating side chains result in high yield, while longer chains without additional coordinating groups result in low yield. Conversely, Rule 5 states that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with nonpolar side chains result in high yield, and introducing polar groups leads to low yield. This presents a contradiction regarding the effect of chain length and polarity on yield.

  - **Recommendation**: Clarify and differentiate the conditions under which chain length and polarity affect the yield. Specifically:

    - **Separate Rules Based on Functional Groups**: Create distinct rules for amino acids and simple aliphatic carboxylic acids to avoid confusion.

      - **For Amino Acids**: Emphasize that short-chain amino acids with coordinating side chains (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, sulfur groups) promote high yield due to effective metal coordination.

      - **For Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**: Highlight that longer-chain aliphatic acids without polar groups enhance yield through hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst matrix.

    - **Revise Rules**:

      - **Modified Rule 2**: Focus on short-chain amino acids with coordinating side chains leading to high yield.

      - **Modified Rule 5**: Focus on long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar substitutions leading to high yield.

    - **Add Clarifying Examples**: Provide examples that clearly fit each rule to illustrate the distinctions.

- **Advice 2**: **Enhance Rules Supported by Limited Data Points for Better Coverage**

  - **Issue**: Rules like Rule 7 and Rule 15 are supported by only one example each, limiting their robustness and applicability.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge these rules with others that share common themes to strengthen coverage.

      - **Example**: Integrate Rule 7 (fluorinated chains leading to low yield) with rules addressing electron-withdrawing groups that decrease coordination efficiency.

      - **Example**: Merge Rule 15 (cyclic dicarboxylic acids with multiple carbonyl groups leading to high yield) with rules highlighting multidentate chelation enhancing yield.

    - **Expand Data Set**: Include additional modifiers that fit these criteria to validate and reinforce the rules.

    - **Adjust Rule Specificity**: Broaden the rules to encompass more compounds by focusing on the underlying chemical principles rather than specific structures.

- **Advice 3**: **Reduce Redundancy by Combining Overlapping Rules**

  - **Issue**: Rules such as Rule 4 and Rule 13 both address modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups leading to high yield due to chelation.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **Merge Rules**: Combine Rule 4 and Rule 13 into a single, more comprehensive rule that states:

      - **New Rule**: "Modifiers possessing multiple coordinating functional groups (such as hydroxyl and carboxylate groups) in proximity on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to enhanced chelation."

    - **Provide Diverse Examples**: Include various compounds that demonstrate this principle, such as polyhydroxy acids and diacids with adjacent hydroxyl groups.

    - **Clarify Scope**: Specify that the rule applies to both polyhydroxy compounds and other multidentate ligands to prevent ambiguity.

- **Advice 4**: **Ensure Each Rule Includes Contrasting Examples for Clarity**

  - **Issue**: Some rules lack either high-yield or low-yield examples, which may hinder understanding of the rule's applicability.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **Add Missing Examples**: For each rule, provide at least one example of a modifier resulting in the opposite yield outcome.

      - **Example**: In Rule 3, include a high-yield example where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocycle and a low-yield example where it is not.

    - **Highlight Contrasts**: Clearly explain why the included examples conform to or deviate from the rule based on their structural features.

- **Advice 5**: **Broaden Overly Specific Rules to Increase Applicability**

  - **Issue**: Rules like Rule 12 and Rule 15 are highly specific and based on single examples, limiting their usefulness.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **Generalize the Rules**: Expand the rules to encompass a wider range of compounds by focusing on the general chemical characteristics.

      - **Modified Rule 12**: "Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy) and additional coordinating functionalities (e.g., carbonyl or hydroxyl groups) result in high yield due to enhanced electron density and coordination ability."

    - **Incorporate Additional Examples**: Identify and include other compounds that fit the broadened criteria to support the rule.

    - **Assess Necessity**: If the rule cannot be adequately supported with more examples, consider integrating its content into related rules.

- **Advice 6**: **Clarify the Dominant Factors in Rules Involving Multiple Structural Features**

  - **Issue**: In Rule 10, it's unclear whether the bulkiness of the side chain or the presence of coordinating heteroatoms is the primary determinant of high yield.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **Split the Rule if Necessary**:

      - **Rule Focusing on Coordinating Heteroatoms**: Emphasize that the presence of heteroatoms capable of coordination in side chains enhances yield.

      - **Rule Addressing Steric Effects**: Explain that bulky side chains without coordinating ability may hinder yield due to steric hindrance.

    - **Clarify Interaction of Factors**: Provide insight into how bulkiness and coordination ability may interplay, possibly enhancing or detracting from the yield.

    - **Provide Distinct Examples**: Use examples that isolate each factor to illustrate their individual effects.

- **Advice 7**: **Translate Rules into SMILES-Based Patterns for Practical Application**

  - **Issue**: The current rules are not directly translatable into SMILES patterns, which limits their utility in computational predictions.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **Define SMARTS Patterns**: For each rule, develop corresponding SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification) patterns that represent the structural features described.

      - **Example for Rule 1**: SMARTS pattern for aromatic carboxylic acids with para-position amino groups.

    - **Create a Rule Dictionary**: Compile the rules and associated SMARTS patterns into a reference that can be used by cheminformatics tools.

    - **Test the Patterns**: Validate the SMARTS patterns against the dataset to ensure they accurately capture the intended compounds.

    - **Provide Usage Guidelines**: Include instructions on how to apply the SMILES-based rules in computational workflows for predicting yields.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Additional Physical-Chemical Properties into the Rules**

  - **Issue**: Some rules focus solely on structural motifs without considering properties like pKa, steric parameters, or electronic effects quantitatively.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **Integrate Quantitative Descriptors**: Where applicable, include descriptors such as acidity (pKa), electron-withdrawing/donating effects (Hammett constants), or steric parameters (Taft constants).

      - **Example**: Modify rules to state that modifiers with substituents having high electron-withdrawing Hammett σ values enhance yield due to increased metal coordination.

    - **Use These Descriptors to Refine Rules**: Adjust rules based on threshold values of these descriptors to improve prediction accuracy.

- **Advice 9**: **Evaluate and Update Rules Based on Additional Data**

  - **Issue**: The dataset is limited, and some rules may not be fully validated across a broader range of modifiers.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **Expand the Data Set**: Include more experimental data for modifiers that fit within and outside the current rules.

    - **Iteratively Refine Rules**: Use the expanded dataset to test the existing rules, identify exceptions, and adjust the rules accordingly.

    - **Document Exceptions**: Keep track of modifiers that do not conform to the rules to understand their unique properties or to further refine the rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Ensure Consistency in Terminology and Definitions Across All Rules**

  - **Issue**: Inconsistent use of terminology or definitions can lead to misunderstandings and misapplication of the rules.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **Standardize Terms**: Use consistent chemical nomenclature and descriptors throughout all rules.

    - **Provide Definitions**: Include a glossary for any specialized terms or abbreviations used in the rules.

    - **Cross-Reference Related Rules**: Indicate when rules are related or when one rule overrides another under specific conditions.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify Rules into Quantifiable Features**

  Convert the current descriptive rules into quantifiable features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For each modifier, identify specific structural features that can be counted or measured. For example:

  - **Number of Carboxylic Acid Groups**: Count the occurrence of carboxylic acid groups in the molecule.
  - **Chain Length**: Calculate the length of the longest carbon chain.
  - **Number of Heteroatoms**: Count nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms that may coordinate with metal centers.
  - **Position of Functional Groups**: Identify the position of functional groups relative to the main functional group (e.g., para-position on aromatic rings).

  By quantifying these features, you can create a numeric feature matrix suitable for statistical analysis or machine learning models.

---

- **Advice 2**: **Develop a Comprehensive Feature Extraction Protocol**

  Create a standardized protocol for feature extraction from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit, Open Babel). Define a set of molecular descriptors relevant to coordination chemistry and catalytic activity, such as:

  - **Topological Descriptors**: Molecular weight, number of rings, ring size.
  - **Electronic Descriptors**: Partial charges, electron-donating/withdrawing capacity.
  - **Geometric Descriptors**: Steric bulk near coordination sites, molecular volume.
  - **Functional Group Counts**: Specific counts of amino, hydroxyl, carbonyl, thiol groups.
  - **Substructure Flags**: Presence or absence of key substructures (e.g., pyridine ring, indole moiety).

  Implement automated scripts to process the SMILES data and extract these features consistently.

---

- **Advice 3**: **Translate Rules into SMARTS Patterns**

  Rewrite the rules using SMARTS notation to create pattern-matching rules that can be programmatically applied to the SMILES data. For example:

  - **Rule for High Yield with Aromatic Amines**:
    - SMARTS Pattern: `c1ccc(cc1)N` (aromatic ring with an amino group)
  - **Rule for Low Yield with Ether Linkages**:
    - SMARTS Pattern: `C-O-C` (ether linkage in an aliphatic chain)

  Using SMARTS patterns allows for precise identification of substructures and facilitates the creation of a feature matrix where each pattern's presence or absence is a binary feature.

---

- **Advice 4**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions**

  Clearly define functional groups and their variants to avoid ambiguity. Create a dictionary of functional groups with their corresponding SMARTS patterns and assign unique identifiers to them. This standardization will make it easier to map structural features to numeric representations.

---

- **Advice 5**: **Prioritize Key Coordinating Functional Groups**

  Focus on the most influential coordinating groups identified in the reaction mechanism, such as:

  - **Amine Groups (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary)**
  - **Carboxylate Anions**
  - **Hydroxyl Groups**
  - **Thiol Groups**
  - **Nitrogen Heterocycles (e.g., Pyridine, Pyrazole)**

  Assign higher weights or importance to these groups when generating the feature matrix, as they are critical for metal coordination and catalytic activity.

---

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Steric and Electronic Parameters**

  Include features that account for steric hindrance and electronic effects, such as:

  - **Bulkiness Near Coordination Sites**: Calculate the Sterimol parameters or use cone angles to assess steric effects.
  - **Hammett Sigma Constants**: Use substituent constants to represent electron-donating or withdrawing effects of substituents.
  - **Hydrophobicity (LogP)**: Determine the compound's hydrophobicity, which may influence interaction with the catalyst matrix.

  Quantifying these parameters helps in associating structural features with their impact on yield.

---

- **Advice 7**: **Utilize Machine Learning for Feature Selection**

  Apply machine learning techniques to identify the most significant features affecting yield. Use methods such as:

  - **Correlation Analysis**: Identify features that correlate strongly with high or low yield.
  - **Feature Importance from Decision Trees or Random Forests**: Determine which features contribute most to predictive models.
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduce dimensionality and highlight key contributing features.

  This data-driven approach can refine the rules to focus on the most impactful features.

---

- **Advice 8**: **Create a Hierarchical Rule Structure**

  Organize the rules into a hierarchical or decision-tree format where primary rules are applied first, followed by secondary rules. For example:

  1. **Primary Rule**: Presence of coordinating heteroatoms (N, O, S) directly attached to aromatic rings results in high yield.
  2. **Secondary Rule**: If primary rule is met, assess chain length and steric effects to further refine yield prediction.

  This structure simplifies the rule application process and aids in programming the rules for feature extraction.

---

- **Advice 9**: **Address Exceptions and Conflicting Features**

  Analyze compounds that do not fit neatly into the existing rules and identify why they are exceptions. Modify the rules to account for these cases, possibly by introducing conditional statements or exception handling mechanisms in your code.

---

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Iterate the Rules**

  Test the revised rules against the dataset to evaluate their predictive accuracy. Use cross-validation techniques to assess performance and adjust the rules as necessary. Continuous validation ensures that the rules remain robust and reliable.

---

- **Advice 11**: **Document the Rules and Workflow**

  Maintain clear documentation of the rules, feature definitions, and the workflow used for feature extraction and model building. This transparency facilitates collaboration, reproduction of results, and future optimization efforts.

---

- **Advice 12**: **Leverage Domain Knowledge**

  Collaborate with chemists to ensure that the rules align with chemical intuition and mechanistic understanding. Incorporating expert insights can improve the relevance and applicability of the rules, especially for complex coordination behaviors.

**End of Advice**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (six carbons or more) *without polar substituents* result in **high yield**; introduction of polar groups such as hydroxyl or amino leads to **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Unsubstituted long-chain acids can interact hydrophobically with the catalyst matrix, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Polar substituents introduce hydrogen bonding and steric effects that can disrupt these interactions and hinder effective coordination with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *para-position substituents* capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups or non-coordinating substituents result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Substituents with lone pairs or electron-withdrawing properties enhance the ability to coordinate with the metal center, improving catalyst performance. Electron-donating groups without coordinating ability do not facilitate this interaction and may inhibit effective binding.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic amino acids* or *aminodicarboxylic acids* (chain lengths of five carbons or fewer) with side-chain coordinating groups (e.g., amino, sulfhydryl) result in **high yield**; longer-chain amino acids or those lacking coordinating side chains result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Short chains with coordinating groups in proximity to the carboxylate enhance chelation with metal centers. Longer chains increase flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing coordination efficiency.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing *multiple hydroxyl groups* on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxy acids) attached to a carboxylic acid result in **high yield**; modifiers with ether linkages or single hydroxyl groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Ether linkages and single hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination, reducing effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *heteroaromatic carboxylic acids* with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in **high yield**; those where the carboxyl group is separated from the heterocycle result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Direct attachment allows the nitrogen atom to effectively coordinate with the metal center. Separation by additional rings or linkers diminishes this interaction, reducing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with aromatic side chains* containing heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., indole group in tryptophan) result in **high yield**; those lacking such heteroatoms result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms do not contribute to metal binding and may introduce steric hindrance.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers possessing *multiple functional groups capable of chelation* (e.g., hydroxyl and carboxyl groups) in close proximity result in **high yield**; similar compounds lacking coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple coordinating groups enhance binding to the metal center through chelation, increasing catalyst effectiveness. Without these groups, coordination is less effective.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with *sterically hindered functional groups* near coordinating sites result in **low yield** due to reduced coordination efficiency.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky substituents can obstruct access to coordination sites on the metal center, decreasing catalytic activity by hindering effective ligand-metal interactions.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing *fluorinated alkyl chains* result in **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability and increased hydrophobicity, which hinders interaction with the metal center.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorination increases electronegativity and hydrophobic character, reducing the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal center and interact effectively within the catalyst system.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *cyclic dicarboxylic acids* with multiple carbonyl groups (e.g., cyclic anhydrides or lactones) result in **high yield** due to enhanced chelation properties.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple carbonyl groups in a cyclic structure offer several points of coordination, facilitating strong multidentate binding to the metal center and improving catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with *amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups* result in **low yield** due to altered electronic properties and reduced ability to coordinate with the metal center.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The presence of an amide linkage can delocalize electron density and interfere with the carboxylate's ability to effectively coordinate with the metal, diminishing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing *ether linkages* in aliphatic chains without additional coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weaker ligands compared to hydroxyl or carboxylate groups. Ether linkages increase flexibility and can reduce the effectiveness of coordination with the metal center due to unfavorable conformations.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-withdrawing substituents* capable of coordination (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl groups) result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-methoxybenzoic acid** (if present)

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate and enhance its ability to coordinate with the metal center. Electron-donating groups decrease this ability, reducing catalytic effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with *aldehyde or ketone substituents* on the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions with the metal center and reduced coordination ability.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde and ketone groups can participate in undesired side reactions or chelation that competes with the intended coordination, leading to decreased catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers possessing *bulky hydrophobic groups in combination with coordinating substituents* result in **high yield** due to enhanced interactions with both the metal center and the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky hydrophobic groups can interact with the catalyst's framework, while coordinating substituents (e.g., methoxy, ketone) enhance metal binding, synergistically improving catalytic performance.

The rule combines sub-structures and is supported by data (e.g., tryptophan yields high; phenylalanine yields low). The balance between complexity and coverage is satisfactory.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear and specifies that modifiers with multiple functional groups capable of chelation in close proximity result in high yield, while similar compounds lacking coordinating groups result in low yield. It provides property insight into the importance of chelation. The rule effectively combines sub-structures and is supported by data (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yields high; 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yields low). The balance is appropriate.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly states that modifiers with sterically hindered functional groups near coordinating sites result in low yield. It provides insight into how steric hindrance affects coordination efficiency. The rule considers structural features and is supported by data (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid yields low). The coverage meets the minimum requirement, and the balance is acceptable.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear in stating that modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield. It provides property insight into how fluorination affects coordination and hydrophobicity. However, the rule is only supported by a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid yields low). The coverage is insufficient according to the criteria requiring at least two supporting data points. Therefore, this rule lacks adequate coverage.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** specifies that cyclic dicarboxylic acids with multiple carbonyl groups result in high yield. It offers property insight into enhanced chelation properties but is only supported by a single data point (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid yields high). The coverage is insufficient, failing to meet the minimum requirement. Hence, the rule lacks adequate data support.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear in stating that modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups result in low yield. It provides property insight into altered electronic properties affecting coordination. The rule is supported by at least two data points (e.g., 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid and (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid yield low). The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** clearly states that modifiers containing ether linkages in aliphatic chains without additional coordinating groups result in low yield. It provides insight into how ether oxygens affect coordination. The rule combines sub-structures and is supported by data (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid yields low). The coverage is acceptable as it meets the minimum data requirement.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** is redundant with Rule 2, both addressing aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents resulting in high yield and electron-donating groups resulting in low yield. While the rule is clear and provides property insight, having two rules covering the same concept adds unnecessary complexity. It would be better to combine this rule with Rule 2 to improve clarity and balance.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** clearly indicates that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone substituents on the aromatic ring result in low yield. It provides property insight into potential side reactions and reduced coordination ability. The rule is supported by data (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid yields low), satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is good.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** specifies that modifiers possessing bulky hydrophobic groups with coordinating substituents result in high yield. While it provides property insight, the rule is only supported by a single data point (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid yields high). The coverage is insufficient according to the criteria, and the rule lacks adequate data support.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Remove Rules 9, 10, and 15** from the rule set due to insufficient data support. Each of these rules is only backed by a single data point, which does not meet the minimum requirement of at least two supporting examples. Eliminating these rules will strengthen the rule set by ensuring all rules have adequate coverage and reliability.

- **Advice 2**: **Combine Rule 13 with Rule 2** to eliminate redundancy. Both rules address aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents resulting in high yield and electron-donating substituents leading to low yield. Merging these rules will simplify the rule set, reduce complexity, and provide a clearer guide for predicting outcomes based on substituent effects on aromatic rings.

- **Advice 3**: **Ensure consistency between rules regarding chain length and functional groups**. There appears to be potential confusion between Rule 2 (which emphasizes short-chain amino acids with coordinating side chains resulting in high yield) and Rule 5 (which focuses on long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar substituents yielding high results). Clarify these rules to specify the contexts in which chain length and functional groups influence the yield, ensuring they do not contradict each other.

- **Advice 4**: **Augment rules with additional supporting data where possible**. For rules that are currently supported by limited examples (e.g., Rules 11 and 14), consider obtaining more experimental data or literature evidence to strengthen their validity. Increasing the number of supporting data points will enhance the reliability and applicability of these rules.

- **Advice 5**: **Review all rules for sufficient coverage and clarity**. Ensure that each rule is supported by at least two examples of both high and low yields, meeting the criteria for acceptable coverage. Additionally, verify that the rules are articulated clearly, focusing on the key structural features and functional groups that influence the reaction yield, to make them practical and easy to apply.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (six carbons or more) *without polar substituents* result in **high yield**; introduction of polar groups such as hydroxyl or amino leads to **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Unsubstituted long-chain acids can interact hydrophobically with the catalyst matrix, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Polar substituents introduce hydrogen bonding and steric effects that can disrupt these interactions and hinder effective coordination with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *para-position substituents* capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups or non-coordinating substituents result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Substituents with lone pairs or electron-withdrawing properties enhance the ability to coordinate with the metal center, improving catalyst performance. Electron-donating groups without coordinating ability do not facilitate this interaction and may inhibit effective binding.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic amino acids* or *aminodicarboxylic acids* (chain lengths of five carbons or fewer) with side-chain coordinating groups (e.g., amino, sulfhydryl) result in **high yield**; longer-chain amino acids or those lacking coordinating side chains result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Short chains with coordinating groups in proximity to the carboxylate enhance chelation with metal centers. Longer chains increase flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing coordination efficiency.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing *multiple hydroxyl groups* on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxy acids) attached to a carboxylic acid result in **high yield**; modifiers with ether linkages or single hydroxyl groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Ether linkages and single hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination, reducing effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *heteroaromatic carboxylic acids* with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in **high yield**; those where the carboxyl group is separated from the heterocycle result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Direct attachment allows the nitrogen atom to effectively coordinate with the metal center. Separation by additional rings or linkers diminishes this interaction, reducing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with aromatic side chains* containing heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., indole group in tryptophan) result in **high yield**; those lacking such heteroatoms result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms do not contribute to metal binding and may introduce steric hindrance.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers possessing *multiple functional groups capable of chelation* (e.g., hydroxyl and carboxyl groups) in close proximity result in **high yield**; similar compounds lacking coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple coordinating groups enhance binding to the metal center through chelation, increasing catalyst effectiveness. Without these groups, coordination is less effective.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with *sterically hindered functional groups* near coordinating sites result in **low yield** due to reduced coordination efficiency.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky substituents can obstruct access to coordination sites on the metal center, decreasing catalytic activity by hindering effective ligand-metal interactions.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing *fluorinated alkyl chains* result in **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability and increased hydrophobicity, which hinders interaction with the metal center.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorination increases electronegativity and hydrophobic character, reducing the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal center and interact effectively within the catalyst system.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *cyclic dicarboxylic acids* with multiple carbonyl groups (e.g., cyclic anhydrides or lactones) result in **high yield** due to enhanced chelation properties.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple carbonyl groups in a cyclic structure offer several points of coordination, facilitating strong multidentate binding to the metal center and improving catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with *amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups* result in **low yield** due to altered electronic properties and reduced ability to coordinate with the metal center.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The presence of an amide linkage can delocalize electron density and interfere with the carboxylate's ability to effectively coordinate with the metal, diminishing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing *ether linkages* in aliphatic chains without additional coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weaker ligands compared to hydroxyl or carboxylate groups. Ether linkages increase flexibility and can reduce the effectiveness of coordination with the metal center due to unfavorable conformations.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-withdrawing substituents* capable of coordination (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl groups) result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-methoxybenzoic acid** (if present)

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate and enhance its ability to coordinate with the metal center. Electron-donating groups decrease this ability, reducing catalytic effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with *aldehyde or ketone substituents* on the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions with the metal center and reduced coordination ability.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde and ketone groups can participate in undesired side reactions or chelation that competes with the intended coordination, leading to decreased catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers possessing *bulky hydrophobic groups in combination with coordinating substituents* result in **high yield** due to enhanced interactions with both the metal center and the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky hydrophobic groups can interact with the catalyst's framework, while coordinating substituents (e.g., methoxy, ketone) enhance metal binding, synergistically improving catalytic performance.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate how combinations of specific functional groups and structural features within the molecular modifiers influence the yield of the reaction. By focusing on multiple sub-structures—such as chain length, presence of coordinating groups, and steric factors—the rules capture the underlying physical-chemical properties affecting catalytic activity. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity, helping predict whether a given modifier will result in a high or low yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct the SMARTS patterns for Rule 1**. The current SMARTS patterns use syntax like `C{6,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` and `[#6]{5,}[OX2H]`, which are invalid in SMARTS notation. Instead, use recursive SMARTS or atom counts to represent long aliphatic chains. For example:
  - **High Yield Pattern**: Use `[$([CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2,CH3])][CX3](=O)[OX1H]` to match aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of six or more carbons without polar substituents.
  - **Low Yield Pattern**: Include patterns for polar substituents on long chains, such as `[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][OX2H]` for hydroxyl groups and `[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][NX3;H2,H1]` for amino groups.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Generalize the SMARTS patterns for Rule 2**. The current patterns match only specific molecules rather than capturing the broader rule. Instead, create patterns that match any aromatic carboxylic acid with para-position coordinating groups:
  - **High Yield Pattern**: `c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[OX1H]` with a coordinating group at the para position. You can specify the para substituent using a recursive SMARTS pattern: `[$(c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H])cc1[!H])]`, where `[!H]` represents a substituent capable of coordination (e.g., `[NX3;H2,H1]`, `[N+](=O)[O-]`, `[CBr]`).
  - **Low Yield Pattern**: Similar to the high yield pattern but with electron-donating or non-coordinating substituents in the para position, such as `[CH3]` or `[C=O]`.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Implement proper atom counting in SMARTS patterns**. Since SMARTS does not support quantifiers like `{n,}`, you can use recursive SMARTS or SMILES arbitrary target specification (SMARTS) extensions. For chain length, you can use:
  - Use wildcards with specified chain length: `[CH2]` repeated six times to represent a chain of six carbons: `[CH3][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]`.
  - Alternatively, use the `*` and recursive patterns: `[$(CCCCCC[CX3](=O)[OX1H])]` to match six-carbon chains ending with a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Expand the code to include all rules (Rules 1–15)**. Currently, the code only implements Rules 1 and 2. To create an effective feature matrix, each rule must be translated into accurate SMARTS patterns and added to the code in the same structure.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Validate and test each SMARTS pattern individually**. Before integrating the patterns into the code, test them using RDKit or another cheminformatics toolkit to ensure they match the intended chemical structures. This testing can prevent errors due to incorrect pattern syntax or logic.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Refine the matching logic in the code**. Adjust the code to handle cases where multiple rules might match a single molecule. Ensure that high yield patterns are checked before low yield patterns within each rule to prioritize the correct prediction. Also, consider adding code to prevent conflicting assignments (e.g., a molecule matching both high and low yield patterns for the same rule).

- **Suggestion 7**: **Improve error handling for unparsable SMILES**. Modify the code to log or report SMILES strings that cannot be parsed by RDKit, allowing for data cleaning or correction rather than silently assigning zeros.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Enhance code comments and documentation**. Add detailed comments explaining the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and any non-obvious code sections. This practice will help collaborators understand and maintain the code.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Consider using molecular fingerprints or descriptors**. For more complex patterns or properties (like chain length), it might be more effective to calculate molecular descriptors or use fingerprints that can capture these features numerically.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Use substructure queries for functional groups**. Create a library of SMARTS patterns for common functional groups mentioned in the rules (e.g., hydroxyl groups, amino groups, aromatic rings, coordinating heteroatoms). This library can be reused across different rules and improve consistency.

   - **Train Leverage:** [0.0289, -0.0041]

2. **Metrics During Current Iteration:**

   - **First Set:**
     - **Train Support:** 0.0095
     - **Train Confidence:** 0.6111
     - **Train Lift:** 1.2162
     - **Train Leverage:** 0.0047

   - **Second Set:**
     - **Train Support:** 0.1657
     - **Train Confidence:** 0.5650
     - **Train Lift:** 1.1248
     - **Train Leverage:** 0.0045

     - **Train Lift:** 1.0
     - **Train Leverage:** 0.0

---

**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Support Analysis:**

   - **Observation:** The **train support** has decreased from previous values (0.1667, 0.1845) to **0.0** in the latest iteration.
   - **Interpretation:** A train support of **0.0** indicates that none of the records in the training dataset satisfy the conditions of the current rules. This suggests that the rules are either too restrictive or improperly defined.
   - **Impact:** Zero support means the rules have no applicability to the dataset, rendering any derived insights or predictions ineffective.

2. **Confidence Analysis:**

   - **Observation:** The **train confidence** has decreased from previous values (approximately 0.54 to 0.64) to **0.5** in the latest iteration.
   - **Interpretation:** Confidence represents the probability that the rule prediction is true given that the rule condition is true. A confidence of **0.5** is akin to random chance, indicating no predictive power.
   - **Impact:** Lower confidence reduces the reliability of the rules in making accurate predictions about high or low yields.

3. **Lift Analysis:**

   - **Observation:** The **train lift** has decreased from previous values (1.0559 to 1.2162) to **1.0**.
   - **Interpretation:** A lift of **1.0** means that the rule does not improve the likelihood of the prediction beyond the base rate in the dataset. In other words, knowing the rule condition does not provide any additional information about the likelihood of the prediction being true.
   - **Impact:** A lift of 1.0 indicates that the rules are not useful for identifying conditions that lead to high or low yields.

4. **Leverage Analysis:**

   - **Observation:** The **train leverage** has decreased to **0.0** from previous positive values.
   - **Interpretation:** Leverage measures the difference between the observed rule support and the expected support if the items were independent. A leverage of **0.0** suggests no association between the rule conditions and the predictions.
   - **Impact:** Without leverage, the rules do not contribute to understanding the relationships within the data.

---

**Determining If a Local Minimum Has Been Reached:**

- **Metric Trends:** The decline in support, confidence, and lift indicates that the performance of the rules has deteriorated compared to previous iterations.
- **Local Minimum Indication:** The stagnation or decline of key metrics suggests that the current set of rules may represent a local minimum in the performance landscape.
- **Iteration Sufficiency:** Given that the latest metrics show no improvement and even regression, it appears that sufficient iterations have occurred to conclude that the current approach is not yielding better results.

---

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Re-evaluate Rule Conditions:**

   - **Relax Overly Restrictive Criteria:** The zero support indicates that the rules may be too specific. Broadening the conditions could include more relevant records.
   - **Ensure Alignment with Data:** Verify that the rules correspond to actual patterns within the dataset.

2. **Enhance Rule Relevance:**

   - **Focus on High-Impact Features:** Identify and prioritize functional groups or molecular features that have the most significant influence on yield.
   - **Incorporate Statistical Analysis:** Use statistical methods to discern which attributes are most strongly correlated with high yields.

3. **Simplify Rules:**

   - **Reduce Complexity:** Overly complex rules may not generalize well. Simplify rules to core principles that capture essential relationships.
   - **Avoid Redundancy:** Eliminate overlapping or redundant rules to enhance clarity and effectiveness.

4. **Improve Confidence and Lift:**

   - **Target Higher Confidence Rules:** Adjust the rules to increase confidence above random chance (greater than 0.5). This may involve refining conditions to better capture true positives.
   - **Aim for Lift Greater Than 1:** Modify rules to ensure they provide predictive value beyond the base rate, indicating they are useful for prediction.

5. **Increase Support:**

   - **Broaden Applicability:** Adjust rule conditions to apply to a larger portion of the dataset without sacrificing confidence and lift.
   - **Balance Specificity and Generality:** Find a middle ground where rules are neither too specific (low support) nor too general (low confidence and lift).

6. **Iterative Refinement:**

   - **Stepwise Adjustments:** Make incremental changes to rules and assess the impact on metrics after each change.
   - **Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly compare new metrics to previous ones to track improvements or declines.

7. **Leverage Domain Expertise:**

   - **Consult Chemical Principles:** Ensure that rules are grounded in established chemical knowledge and rationales.
   - **Cross-Validate with Experts:** Collaborate with domain experts to validate the plausibility and significance of the rules.

8. **Data Quality and Integrity:**

   - **Verify Data Accuracy:** Ensure that the dataset is accurate and that any anomalies are addressed.
   - **Handle Missing Values:** Address any missing or incomplete data that may be affecting the rules' applicability.

9. **Algorithmic Adjustments:**

   - **Explore Alternative Models:** Consider using different algorithms or modeling approaches that may capture patterns more effectively.
   - **Parameter Tuning:** Adjust parameters within the current modeling framework to optimize performance.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current rules are not performing effectively, as evidenced by the zero support and neutral confidence and lift values. To enhance performance:

- **Revise and Relax Rule Conditions:** Broaden the rules to cover more data without compromising accuracy.
- **Focus on Key Predictors:** Prioritize features with strong correlations to yield outcomes.
- **Iterate Thoughtfully:** Make gradual adjustments and continuously monitor metric changes.

By implementing these strategies, we can move beyond the current local minimum and develop rules that are both meaningful and predictive, improving confidence and lift while maintaining adequate support.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Upon reviewing the latest training results and comparing them with previous metrics, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current rules used to generate the feature matrix for predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

1. **Accuracy Metrics Comparison:**

   - **Previous Accuracies for Reference:**
     - Validation Accuracies consistently around **0.76**.
     - Test Accuracies ranging between **0.625** and **0.75**.

   - **Current Accuracies:**
     - **5-Fold Validation Accuracy:** **0.514**
     - The model predicts **low loading** for all molecules.

   The significant drop in validation accuracy from approximately **0.76** to **0.514** indicates a decrease in the model's performance. The model's current accuracy is only marginally better than random guessing for a binary classification task, suggesting that the predictive capability of the model has diminished.

2. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

   - The current rules appear to be **ineffective** in distinguishing between modifiers that result in high loading and those that lead to low loading.
   - The model predicts **low loading** for **all molecules**, regardless of their experimental values. This uniformity in prediction implies that the model is not utilizing the features derived from the rules effectively to make accurate classifications.
   - The SHAP values for **Rule 2** are **0.0** for all molecules, indicating that this rule is not contributing to the model's predictions.

3. **Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   - The model is likely **underfitting** the data. Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data.
   - The consistency in predicting a single class suggests that the model does not have sufficient complexity or that the features are not informative enough to learn the relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding loading outcomes.
   - The lack of variation in SHAP values further supports the notion that the model is not leveraging the rules to make differential predictions.

4. **Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values:**

   - In the current iteration, the SHAP values are **zero** for all molecules, and the model's output does not vary across different inputs.
   - For molecules where the experimental value is **high** but the predicted loading is **low**, the zero SHAP values indicate that **Rule 2** (the only rule with SHAP values reported) is not influencing the prediction towards high loading.
   - The absence of positive SHAP contributions from any rule suggests that the rules are not effectively capturing features indicative of high loading modifiers.

5. **Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

   - The decrease in accuracy from previous iterations implies that the modifications made to the rules or the model have negatively impacted performance.
   - The consistent prediction of low loading, coupled with poor accuracy, suggests that the model has reached a **local minimum** and is not learning effectively from the data.
   - The current rules may be too restrictive or may not cover the necessary molecular features to differentiate between high and low loading modifiers.

6. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

   - The SHAP analysis indicates that the current rules are not contributing meaningful information to the model's predictions.
   - In previous iterations, certain rules had significant positive or negative SHAP values, which influenced the model's predictions. The absence of such contributions in the current iteration points to potential issues with the rules or the feature extraction process.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the model's performance and improve the predictive accuracy, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Refine Problematic Rules:**

   - **Re-evaluate Rule 2**: Since **Rule 2** shows zero SHAP values and does not contribute to the model's predictions, it may need to be revised or expanded. Consider reviewing the criteria for this rule and incorporating additional features that better capture the characteristics of high loading modifiers.
   - **Reintroduce Effective Rules**: In previous iterations, rules such as **Rule 6**, **Rule 11**, and **Rule 15** had significant SHAP values and contributed to the predictions. Reassessing these rules and potentially reintegrating them could provide the model with more informative features.
   - **Address Overgeneralization**: The current rules may be too general, leading to a lack of differentiation between modifiers. Introducing specificity in the rules could help the model distinguish between high and low loading cases.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**

   - **Identify Underestimated Loadings**: For molecules where the experimental loading is high but predicted as low, any rules that would have negative SHAP values (if not zero) need to be scrutinized.
   - **Modify Rule Conditions**: Adjust the rules to reduce unnecessary negative contributions to high loading predictions. This may involve relaxing certain conditions or thresholds within the rules to better align with the observed data.

3. **Enhance Feature Representation:**

   - **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors**: Beyond the current rules, consider including other molecular features that may influence loading, such as electronic properties, steric factors, or solubility parameters.
   - **Utilize Substructure Fingerprints**: Employ computational chemistry tools to generate molecular fingerprints that capture various functional groups and structural motifs relevant to catalytic activity.

4. **Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting:**

   - **Increase Model Complexity**: If the model is too simple, consider using a more complex algorithm or adding layers (if using neural networks) to allow the model to capture non-linear relationships.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Generate new features from existing data that might better represent the underlying patterns. This could include interaction terms or polynomial features.

5. **Iteratively Refine Rules Based on SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Perform Detailed SHAP Analysis**: In future iterations, ensure that SHAP values are computed and analyzed for all rules. Use this information to understand which rules are contributing positively or negatively to the predictions.
   - **Feedback Loop**: Use insights from the SHAP analysis to iteratively modify the rules, focusing on increasing the positive contributions of rules in correctly predicted high loading cases and minimizing the negative impact of rules in misclassified cases.

6. **Validate with Cross-Validation and External Test Sets:**

   - **Employ Cross-Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of data.
   - **External Validation**: Test the model on an independent dataset to assess its generalizability and prevent overfitting to the training data.

7. **Consider Data Imbalance:**

   - **Address Class Imbalance**: If the dataset has a skewed distribution of high and low loading cases, apply techniques such as resampling (oversampling minority class or undersampling majority class), or use algorithms that are robust to class imbalance.

8. **Collaborate with Domain Experts:**

   - **Expert Input**: Engage with chemists or materials scientists to validate the rules from a chemical standpoint. Their insights could lead to more meaningful and accurate rules.
   - **Update Rules with New Knowledge**: Incorporate the latest research findings into the rules to ensure they reflect current understanding of catalytic behavior.

**Conclusion**

The current model's performance indicates that the rules used to generate the feature matrix are not effectively capturing the necessary information to distinguish between high and low loading modifiers. By refining existing rules, reintroducing previously effective ones, enhancing feature representation, and using insights from SHAP analysis, we can improve the model's predictive capabilities. Iterative refinement, combined with expert input and robust validation techniques, will help in developing a more accurate and generalizable model for predicting modifier loading on catalysts.

**Next Steps:**

- **Rule Revision**: Re-express and adjust the rules, focusing on those that previously contributed positively to the model's performance.
- **Model Retraining**: Update the feature matrix based on the revised rules and retrain the model to assess improvements.
- **SHAP Analysis**: Conduct a thorough SHAP analysis after retraining to evaluate the impact of changes and guide further refinements.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously monitor accuracy metrics and compare them with baseline references to ensure progress.

By systematically addressing the identified issues and leveraging SHAP analysis for interpretability, we can enhance the model's performance and contribute valuable insights to the catalytic problem at hand.

**Summary and Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

The current set of rules designed to predict the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp3)–H bond functionalization reaction are not performing effectively. Several key observations highlight the need for optimization:

1. **Poor Model Performance:**
   - The model's accuracy has significantly decreased, with a 5-fold validation accuracy dropping to approximately **51%**, only marginally better than random chance.
   - The model consistently predicts **low loading** for all modifiers, failing to differentiate between high and low yield cases.
   - SHAP analysis indicates that the rules are not contributing meaningful information, with SHAP values for key rules being zero across all molecules.

2. **Ineffective Rules Implementation:**
   - Only a subset of the proposed **15 rules** has been implemented in the code, limiting the model's ability to capture the diverse molecular features affecting yield.
   - The SMARTS patterns used to translate the rules into computational queries contain errors and are overly restrictive or improperly defined.
   - The rules do not adequately account for molecules that exhibit both high and low yield characteristics, leading to conflicting or non-informative predictions.

**Directions to Optimize the Current Rules:**

To enhance the predictive capability of the model and improve the accuracy of the rules, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Correct and Refine SMARTS Patterns:**
   - **Validate Syntax and Semantics:** Ensure that all SMARTS patterns are syntactically correct and accurately represent the intended chemical structures. For example, correct the use of quantifiers and atom counts in patterns.
   - **Implement Proper Atom Counting:** Replace invalid syntax like `{n,}` with recursive SMARTS or explicit atom repetitions to represent features such as chain length.

2. **Expand Rule Implementation:**
   - **Incorporate All Rules:** Implement all **15 rules** consistently in the code to fully capture the relationships between molecular features and yield outcomes.
   - **Balance Specificity and Generality:** Adjust the rules to be neither too specific (causing low support) nor too general (reducing confidence).

3. **Individual Rule Testing and Validation:**
   - **Test SMARTS Patterns Individually:** Use cheminformatics tools like RDKit to test each SMARTS pattern against known molecules to confirm they match the intended structures.
   - **Ensure Rules Align with Experimental Data:** Verify that the rules correctly classify molecules based on experimental high and low yield data.

4. **Refine Matching Logic in Code:**
   - **Handle Multiple Rule Matches:** Modify the code to correctly handle cases where a molecule matches multiple rules, prioritizing rules that are more strongly correlated with yield.
   - **Prevent Conflicting Assignments:** Implement logic to resolve conflicts when a molecule matches both high and low yield patterns.

5. **Reintroduce Effective Rules:**
   - **Leverage Previously Successful Rules:** Reassess and reintegrate rules that previously showed positive contributions in SHAP analysis, such as **Rule 6** and **Rule 11**.
   - **Adjust Rules with Negative SHAP Values:** Modify rules that negatively impact predictions to reduce their adverse effects.

6. **Enhance Feature Representation:**
   - **Include Additional Molecular Descriptors:** Incorporate molecular properties such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, and solubility parameters that may affect catalyst performance.
   - **Utilize Molecular Fingerprints:** Employ computational fingerprints to capture complex structural features and improve model inputs.

7. **Improve Error Handling and Data Quality:**
   - **Address Unparsable SMILES Strings:** Implement error handling to identify and correct invalid SMILES strings rather than assigning default values.
   - **Ensure Data Integrity:** Verify the accuracy and completeness of the dataset to prevent misleading results.

8. **Iterative Refinement and Testing:**
   - **Use Cross-Validation:** Continuously validate the model using cross-validation techniques to monitor improvements.
   - **Iterate Based on Feedback:** Adjust rules iteratively based on model performance metrics and SHAP analysis to gradually enhance predictive accuracy.

9. **Collaboration with Domain Experts:**
   - **Consult Chemists and Material Scientists:** Engage with experts to validate the chemical rationale behind the rules and incorporate domain knowledge.
   - **Update Rules with Expert Insights:** Refine the rules to reflect current understanding and recent developments in catalysis research.

10. **Enhance Documentation and Code Clarity:**
    - **Add Comprehensive Comments:** Document the purpose and logic behind each SMARTS pattern and code block.
    - **Maintain a Functional Group Library:** Create a repository of SMARTS patterns for common functional groups to ensure consistency and reuse.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

Yes, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without risking overfitting. The current model is underfitting, indicating it is too simple and not capturing the complexity of the data. By refining the rules to better represent the chemical features influencing yield and ensuring they are correctly implemented, the model's performance can be improved substantially.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (six carbons or more) *without polar substituents* result in **high yield**; introduction of polar groups such as hydroxyl or amino leads to **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Unsubstituted long-chain acids can interact hydrophobically with the catalyst matrix, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Polar substituents introduce hydrogen bonding and steric effects that can disrupt these interactions and hinder effective coordination with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *para-position substituents* capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups or non-coordinating substituents result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Substituents with lone pairs or electron-withdrawing properties enhance the ability to coordinate with the metal center, improving catalyst performance. Electron-donating groups without coordinating ability do not facilitate this interaction and may inhibit effective binding.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic amino acids* or *aminodicarboxylic acids* (chain lengths of five carbons or fewer) with side-chain coordinating groups (e.g., amino, sulfhydryl) result in **high yield**; longer-chain amino acids or those lacking coordinating side chains result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Short chains with coordinating groups in proximity to the carboxylate enhance chelation with metal centers. Longer chains increase flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing coordination efficiency.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing *multiple hydroxyl groups* on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxy acids) attached to a carboxylic acid result in **high yield**; modifiers with ether linkages or single hydroxyl groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Ether linkages and single hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination, reducing effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *heteroaromatic carboxylic acids* with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in **high yield**; those where the carboxyl group is separated from the heterocycle result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Direct attachment allows the nitrogen atom to effectively coordinate with the metal center. Separation by additional rings or linkers diminishes this interaction, reducing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with aromatic side chains* containing heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., indole group in tryptophan) result in **high yield**; those lacking such heteroatoms result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms do not contribute to metal binding and may introduce steric hindrance.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers possessing *multiple functional groups capable of chelation* (e.g., hydroxyl and carboxyl groups) in close proximity result in **high yield**; similar compounds lacking coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple coordinating groups enhance binding to the metal center through chelation, increasing catalyst effectiveness. Without these groups, coordination is less effective.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with *sterically hindered functional groups* near coordinating sites result in **low yield** due to reduced coordination efficiency.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky substituents can obstruct access to coordination sites on the metal center, decreasing catalytic activity by hindering effective ligand-metal interactions.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing *fluorinated alkyl chains* result in **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability and increased hydrophobicity, which hinders interaction with the metal center.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorination increases electronegativity and hydrophobic character, reducing the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal center and interact effectively within the catalyst system.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *cyclic dicarboxylic acids* with multiple carbonyl groups (e.g., cyclic anhydrides or lactones) result in **high yield** due to enhanced chelation properties.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple carbonyl groups in a cyclic structure offer several points of coordination, facilitating strong multidentate binding to the metal center and improving catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with *amide bonds adjacent to carboxyl groups* result in **low yield** due to altered electronic properties and reduced ability to coordinate with the metal center.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The presence of an amide linkage can delocalize electron density and interfere with the carboxylate's ability to effectively coordinate with the metal, diminishing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing *ether linkages* in aliphatic chains without additional coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weaker ligands compared to hydroxyl or carboxylate groups. Ether linkages increase flexibility and can reduce the effectiveness of coordination with the metal center due to unfavorable conformations.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-withdrawing substituents* capable of coordination (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl groups) result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-methoxybenzoic acid** (if present)

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate and enhance its ability to coordinate with the metal center. Electron-donating groups decrease this ability, reducing catalytic effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with *aldehyde or ketone substituents* on the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions with the metal center and reduced coordination ability.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde and ketone groups can participate in undesired side reactions or chelation that competes with the intended coordination, leading to decreased catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers possessing *bulky hydrophobic groups in combination with coordinating substituents* result in **high yield** due to enhanced interactions with both the metal center and the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky hydrophobic groups can interact with the catalyst's framework, while coordinating substituents (e.g., methoxy, ketone) enhance metal binding, synergistically improving catalytic performance.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate how combinations of specific functional groups and structural features within the molecular modifiers influence the yield of the reaction. By focusing on multiple sub-structures—such as chain length, presence of coordinating groups, and steric factors—the rules capture the underlying physical-chemical properties affecting catalytic activity. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity, helping predict whether a given modifier will result in a high or low yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (six carbons or more) *without polar substituents* result in **high yield**; introduction of polar groups such as hydroxyl or amino leads to **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Unsubstituted long-chain acids can interact hydrophobically with the catalyst matrix, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Polar substituents introduce hydrogen bonding and steric effects that can disrupt these interactions and hinder effective coordination with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic amino acids* or *aminodicarboxylic acids* (chain lengths of five carbons or fewer) with side-chain coordinating groups (e.g., amino, sulfhydryl) result in **high yield**; similar longer-chain amino acids or those lacking coordinating side chains result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Short chains with coordinating groups in proximity to the carboxylate enhance chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst activity. Longer chains increase flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing coordination efficiency.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *para-position substituents* capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) result in **high yield**; those with non-coordinating substituents or electron-donating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers enhance the ability to form strong ligand-metal interactions, improving catalyst performance. Non-coordinating groups or electron-donating substituents without coordinating ability do not facilitate this interaction and may inhibit effective binding.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *heteroaromatic carboxylic acids* with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in **high yield**; those where the carboxyl group is separated from the heterocycle or lacks nitrogen coordination sites result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The nitrogen atom in the heteroaromatic ring can coordinate with the metal center when the carboxyl group is directly attached, enhancing catalyst activity. When the carboxyl group is separated from the ring, this coordination is hindered, reducing effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing *multiple hydroxyl groups* on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**; modifiers with ether linkages or single hydroxyl groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Ether linkages introduce flexibility and reduce coordination ability due to conformational freedom.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *para-position substituents* that are bulky electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky electron-donating groups can sterically hinder the approach of the modifier to the metal center and reduce the acidity of the carboxyl group, decreasing the efficiency of coordination.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with aromatic side chains* containing heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., indole group in tryptophan) result in **high yield**; those lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in the side chain can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms do not contribute to metal binding, possibly reducing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with *aldehyde or ketone groups* adjacent to the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions and reduced coordination ability.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde and ketone groups can participate in side reactions with the metal catalyst or interfere with binding, leading to decreased catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing *fluorinated alkyl chains* result in **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability and increased hydrophobicity, which hinders interaction with the metal center.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorination increases the electron-withdrawing nature and hydrophobicity, reducing the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal center effectively.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *cyclic dicarboxylic acids* with multiple carbonyl groups (e.g., cyclic anhydrides or lactones) result in **high yield** due to enhanced chelation properties.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple carbonyl groups in a rigid cyclic structure enhance multidentate binding to the metal center, improving catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with *ether linkages* in aliphatic chains and lacking additional strong coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are relatively weak ligands, and the flexibility introduced by ether linkages reduces the effective coordination with the metal center due to entropic factors and unfavorable conformations.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with *bulky or sterically hindered substituents* near coordinating sites result in **low yield** due to reduced coordination efficiency.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Steric hindrance from bulky substituents can impede the approach and binding of the modifier to the metal center, decreasing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers possessing *combinations of coordinating groups* and hydrophobic groups in proximity result in **high yield** due to synergistic enhancement of interactions with the metal center and the hydrophobic environment of the catalyst.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Coordinating groups enhance metal binding while adjacent hydrophobic groups facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst framework, improving overall catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *sulfur-containing aromatic carboxylic acids* result in **low yield** due to possible poisoning of the metal catalyst.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Sulfhydryl groups can strongly bind to metal centers and may deactivate the catalyst by forming stable metal-sulfur bonds.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are *polyfunctional acids* with multiple carboxyl groups in close proximity result in **high yield** due to enhanced chelating ability.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple carboxyl groups can chelate the metal center effectively, leading to stronger binding and better catalytic activity.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the rules by focusing on quantifiable molecular features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings, such as counts of specific functional groups, presence of certain atoms, ring structures, and chain lengths. This will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix for computational analysis.**

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate overlapping and similar rules to reduce redundancy and improve clarity. For example, combine rules that involve modifiers with coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl) into a single rule that accounts for the presence and number of these groups.**

- **Advice 3**: **Reframe qualitative descriptors into quantitative thresholds. Define explicit numerical criteria for terms like "long-chain" (e.g., chain length ≥ 6 carbons), "short-chain" (≤ 5 carbons), "bulky groups" (steric hindrance quantified by van der Waals volume), and "electron-donating/withdrawing groups" using Hammett sigma constants or other electronic parameters.**

- **Advice 4**: **Use cheminformatics tools to calculate molecular descriptors from SMILES strings, such as molecular weight, LogP (hydrophobicity), topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and count of heteroatoms. Incorporate these numerical descriptors into the rules to make them more data-driven and quantifiable.**

- **Advice 5**: **Develop a standardized set of features or a feature matrix for all modifiers in the dataset. This matrix should include numerical values for functional group counts, chain lengths, ring types, presence of coordinating atoms, and calculated molecular properties.**

- **Advice 6**: **Apply statistical analysis or machine learning techniques to the feature matrix to identify the most significant molecular features correlated with high or low yield. Use these insights to refine the rules based on empirical data rather than solely on chemical intuition.**

- **Advice 7**: **Create binary features (1 or 0) indicating the presence or absence of specific functional groups or structural motifs (e.g., presence of an amino group adjacent to a carboxyl group, presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle). This simplifies the inclusion of categorical data into numerical models.**

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate electronic descriptors, such as partial charges, HOMO-LUMO gap, or aromaticity indices, which can influence the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal center. These can be computed using quantum chemical calculations or predicted with cheminformatics software.**

- **Advice 9**: **Validate and iterate the revised rules by testing their predictive accuracy on the existing dataset. Analyze mispredictions to further refine the rules or adjust the thresholds and descriptors used. This iterative process will enhance the reliability and practicality of the rules.**

- **Advice 10**: **Document the reasoning and data supporting each rule in a clear and concise manner. Provide examples with calculated descriptor values to illustrate how modifiers fit the rules. This will improve the usability of the rules and assist in training others to apply them correctly.**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic amino acids* or *aminodicarboxylic acids* with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer and side-chain functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl) result in **high yield**; similar longer-chain amino acids or those lacking side-chain functional groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Short-chain amino acids with coordinating side-chain groups are better positioned to chelate metal centers due to proximity and reduced flexibility. This enhances catalyst activity by promoting strong ligand-metal interactions. Longer chains increase flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing coordination efficiency and catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with strongly electron-withdrawing groups capable of coordination (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups or groups that hinder coordination result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and may facilitate stronger coordination with metal centers. They can also participate directly in coordination if they possess lone pairs (e.g., nitro groups). Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and may introduce steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heteroaromatic carboxylic acids* with nitrogen atoms in the ring capable of coordinating to metal centers result in **high yield**; those lacking coordinating heteroatoms or with the carboxyl group disconnected from the heterocycle result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing chelation with metal centers. This dual coordination strengthens metal-ligand interactions, improving catalyst performance. If the carboxyl group is not directly attached to the heterocycle, the potential for such synergistic coordination is diminished.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (six carbons or more) *without polar functional groups* result in **high yield**; introduction of polar groups such as hydroxyl or amino leads to **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Non-polar long-chain acids can enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst framework, potentially stabilizing the active metal center and facilitating substrate access. Polar substituents introduce hydrogen bonding and can disrupt these hydrophobic interactions, possibly leading to catalyst deactivation or reduced activity.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing *multiple hydroxyl groups* on a carbohydrate backbone (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**; modifiers with ether linkages or single hydroxyl groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through multidentate chelation. Ether linkages introduce chain flexibility and are weaker ligands, reducing effective coordination due to entropic factors and less favorable conformations.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with aromatic side chains* containing heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., indole nitrogen in tryptophan) result in **high yield**; those with non-coordinating aromatic side chains result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in the side chain (like the nitrogen in indole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing the overall chelation and stability of the catalyst. Aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms do not contribute additional coordination sites and may not enhance catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing *aldehyde or ketone groups* adjacent to aromatic rings result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions and interference with coordination.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde and ketone groups can undergo side reactions, such as imine formation with amines present in the reaction mixture, reducing the effective concentration of the modifier. Additionally, these groups may interfere with metal coordination by competing for binding sites or altering electronic properties unfavorably.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing *sulfur atoms*, especially *thiol groups* in aromatic systems, result in **low yield** due to potential poisoning of the metal catalyst.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Sulfur-containing groups, particularly thiols, have a high affinity for metal centers and can bind irreversibly, deactivating the catalyst by forming stable metal-sulfur bonds. This diminishes the availability of active sites necessary for the desired catalytic reaction.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with *fluorinated alkyl chains* result in **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability and increased hydrophobicity, which can hinder interaction with the metal center.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorination enhances the electron-withdrawing nature of the alkyl chain, reducing the electron density on potential coordinating atoms. This weakens ligand-metal interactions. Additionally, highly fluorinated chains are exceptionally hydrophobic, which may impede effective integration into a mostly organic catalyst framework.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *bulky electron-donating groups* at the *para-position* (e.g., methyl, methoxy) result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky electron-donating substituents can sterically hinder the approach of the modifier to the metal center and decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, making metal coordination less favorable. This reduces the effectiveness of the modifier in enhancing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with *ether linkages* in aliphatic chains and lacking additional strong coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are relatively weak ligands, and the flexibility introduced by ether linkages leads to entropic disadvantages in forming stable metal-ligand complexes. Without stronger coordinating groups to compensate, these modifiers are less effective in enhancing catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *cyclic compounds with multiple carbonyl groups* capable of chelation (e.g., cyclic anhydrides or lactones) result in **high yield** due to enhanced multidentate coordination.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Rigid cyclic structures with multiple carbonyl groups can act as chelating ligands, forming strong and stable complexes with metal centers. This multidentate binding enhances catalyst stability and activity by firmly anchoring the metal within the catalyst framework.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers combining *ketone functional groups* with neighboring carboxylic acids in aliphatic chains result in **low yield** due to potential interference with coordination and increased chain flexibility.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The presence of ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids may form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or interact unfavorably with the metal center, reducing effective coordination. The increased flexibility of the aliphatic chain can also decrease the likelihood of simultaneous coordination of both functional groups.

---

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic amino acids* or *aminodicarboxylic acids* with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer and side-chain functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl) result in **high yield**; similar longer-chain amino acids or those lacking side-chain functional groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Short-chain amino acids with coordinating side-chain groups are better positioned to chelate metal centers due to proximity and reduced flexibility. This enhances catalyst activity by promoting strong ligand-metal interactions. Longer chains increase flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing coordination efficiency and catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with strongly electron-withdrawing groups capable of coordination (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups or groups that hinder coordination result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and may facilitate stronger coordination with metal centers. They can also participate directly in coordination if they possess lone pairs (e.g., nitro groups). Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and may introduce steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heteroaromatic carboxylic acids* with nitrogen atoms in the ring capable of coordinating to metal centers result in **high yield**; those lacking coordinating heteroatoms or with the carboxyl group disconnected from the heterocycle result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing chelation with metal centers. This dual coordination strengthens metal-ligand interactions, improving catalyst performance. If the carboxyl group is not directly attached to the heterocycle, the potential for such synergistic coordination is diminished.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (six carbons or more) *without polar functional groups* result in **high yield**; introduction of polar groups such as hydroxyl or amino leads to **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Non-polar long-chain acids can enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst framework, potentially stabilizing the active metal center and facilitating substrate access. Polar substituents introduce hydrogen bonding and can disrupt these hydrophobic interactions, possibly leading to catalyst deactivation or reduced activity.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing *multiple hydroxyl groups* on a carbohydrate backbone (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**; modifiers with ether linkages or single hydroxyl groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through multidentate chelation. Ether linkages introduce chain flexibility and are weaker ligands, reducing effective coordination due to entropic factors and less favorable conformations.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with aromatic side chains* containing heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., indole nitrogen in tryptophan) result in **high yield**; those with non-coordinating aromatic side chains result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in the side chain (like the nitrogen in indole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing the overall chelation and stability of the catalyst. Aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms do not contribute additional coordination sites and may not enhance catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing *aldehyde or ketone groups* adjacent to aromatic rings result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions and interference with coordination.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde and ketone groups can undergo side reactions, such as imine formation with amines present in the reaction mixture, reducing the effective concentration of the modifier. Additionally, these groups may interfere with metal coordination by competing for binding sites or altering electronic properties unfavorably.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing *sulfur atoms*, especially *thiol groups* in aromatic systems, result in **low yield** due to potential poisoning of the metal catalyst.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Sulfur-containing groups, particularly thiols, have a high affinity for metal centers and can bind irreversibly, deactivating the catalyst by forming stable metal-sulfur bonds. This diminishes the availability of active sites necessary for the desired catalytic reaction.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with *fluorinated alkyl chains* result in **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability and increased hydrophobicity, which can hinder interaction with the metal center.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorination enhances the electron-withdrawing nature of the alkyl chain, reducing the electron density on potential coordinating atoms. This weakens ligand-metal interactions. Additionally, highly fluorinated chains are exceptionally hydrophobic, which may impede effective integration into a mostly organic catalyst framework.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *bulky electron-donating groups* at the *para-position* (e.g., methyl, methoxy) result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky electron-donating substituents can sterically hinder the approach of the modifier to the metal center and decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, making metal coordination less favorable. This reduces the effectiveness of the modifier in enhancing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with *ether linkages* in aliphatic chains and lacking additional strong coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are relatively weak ligands, and the flexibility introduced by ether linkages leads to entropic disadvantages in forming stable metal-ligand complexes. Without stronger coordinating groups to compensate, these modifiers are less effective in enhancing catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *cyclic compounds with multiple carbonyl groups* capable of chelation (e.g., cyclic anhydrides or lactones) result in **high yield** due to enhanced multidentate coordination.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Rigid cyclic structures with multiple carbonyl groups can act as chelating ligands, forming strong and stable complexes with metal centers. This multidentate binding enhances catalyst stability and activity by firmly anchoring the metal within the catalyst framework.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers combining *ketone functional groups* with neighboring carboxylic acids in aliphatic chains result in **low yield** due to potential interference with coordination and increased chain flexibility.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The presence of ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids may form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or interact unfavorably with the metal center, reducing effective coordination. The increased flexibility of the aliphatic chain can also decrease the likelihood of simultaneous coordination of both functional groups.

These rules have been generated by analyzing the dataset and identifying patterns in how specific combinations of sub-structures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers influence the yield of the reaction. The rules consider underlying physical and chemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, steric factors, and ligand-metal interactions. They aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity, helping predict whether a given modifier will result in a high or low yield. Each rule integrates multiple functional group features to provide clear guidance on the expected catalytic outcome for modifiers fitting the described structural criteria.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1 (Rule 1)**: In the code for Rule 1, the function identifies side-chain functional groups by checking if there are multiple matches of the side-chain patterns (`amino_group`, `carboxylic_acid`). However, this approach might miss molecules where the side-chain functional groups are not duplicated but are present as a single functional group on the side chain. Instead, modify the code to specifically check for the presence of side-chain functional groups attached to the alpha carbon of amino acids. Use substructure searches that match amino acids with side-chain functional groups regardless of the number of occurrences.

- **Suggestion 2 (Rule 2)**: The SMARTS pattern for the bromomethyl group in Rule 2 is incorrect. The current pattern `'[c][CH2Br]'` does not match a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring properly. Update the pattern to `'[cH1][CH2Br]'` to ensure it matches a bromomethyl group at the para position of an aromatic ring. Additionally, adjust the code to verify that the electron-withdrawing group is specifically at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group. You can use substructure queries that enforce the positional relationship between the substituents.

- **Suggestion 3 (Rule 3)**: The SMARTS pattern for heteroaromatic carboxylic acids in Rule 3 is too specific (`'[n][c][c][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) and may miss valid structures. Replace it with a more general pattern that captures any heteroaromatic ring containing nitrogen with a carboxylic acid attached directly to the ring, such as `'[$([nX2]),$([nX3])]:[c]:[c]:[c]:[c]:[c]-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`. This pattern accounts for different heteroaromatic rings and positions of the nitrogen atom.

- **Suggestion 4 (Rule 4)**: The code for Rule 4 checks only for the number of carbons (`num_carbons >= rule['min_carbons']`) but doesn't confirm that the aliphatic chain is linear and lacks polar functional groups. Update the code to search for a linear aliphatic carboxylic acid without any polar substituents. Exclude molecules with hydroxyl or amino groups by incorporating the polar group patterns (`hydroxyl_group`, `amino_group`) into the exclude patterns for this rule.

- **Suggestion 5 (Rule 5)**: For Rule 5, the code counts the number of hydroxyl groups but doesn't ensure they are on a carbohydrate backbone (polyhydroxy acids). Modify the SMARTS pattern to specifically identify polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (sugar acids). Use a pattern like `'[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C(=O)O'` to capture structures like gluconic acid. This pattern ensures multiple hydroxyl groups are present on adjacent carbons.

- **Suggestion 6 (Rule 6)**: The indole ring pattern `'c1cc2c(c1)cc[nH]2'` used for Rule 6 is specific to tryptophan's side chain. To include other amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms, generalize the pattern to match any aromatic systems with heteroatoms capable of coordination. Update the pattern to include rings like imidazole in histidine: `'[$([c][nH][c][c][c][c]),$([c][c][nH][c][c][c]),$([c][c][c][nH][c][c])]'`.

- **Suggestion 7 (Rule 7)**: The SMARTS patterns for aldehyde and ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings in Rule 7 may not capture all relevant molecules. Update the patterns to `'[c][CX3H1](=O)'` for aldehydes and `'[c][CX3](=O)[c]'` for ketones to ensure they are directly attached to the aromatic ring. This adjustment will improve accuracy in identifying modifiers that result in low yield due to interfering carbonyl groups.

- **Suggestion 8 (Rule 9)**: The pattern for fluorinated alkyl chains in Rule 9 (`'[CX4]([F,Cl,Br,I])([F,Cl,Br,I])([F,Cl,Br,I])[#6]'`) may not match longer fluorinated chains or correctly identify perfluorinated chains. Modify the pattern to capture any perfluoroalkyl chain, such as `'[CX4]([F])([F])([F])'` and consider matching longer chains with multiple CF₂ units.

- **Suggestion 9 (General)**: Implement more precise positional specificity in SMARTS patterns where necessary. For example, in rules concerning substituents at the para position, ensure the patterns enforce the para relationship between functional groups. Use `[*]c1ccc([*!H0X0])[c]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` where `[*]` represents the required substituent at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 10 (Code Structure)**: Include clear comments and documentation within the code to explain the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and the logic behind the pattern matching. This will facilitate future modifications and make the code more maintainable.

# Performance Analysis of Current Rules Based on Current Metrics

## Introduction

This analysis evaluates the performance of the current set of rules in predicting high yield outcomes in a catalytic problem. The focus is on comparing the **confidence** and **lift** metrics of the current rules against previous iterations to determine improvements and identify areas for further enhancement.

## Overview of Metrics

Before diving into the analysis, here's a brief recap of the key metrics:

- **Support**: Proportion of records where both the rule conditions and predictions are true.
- **Confidence**: Likelihood of the prediction given that the condition is met.
- **Lift**: Measure of how much more likely the prediction is compared to random chance.
- **Leverage**: Difference between observed support and expected support if the items were independent.

## Comparison of Current and Reference Metrics

### Reference Metrics (Previous Rules)

- **Train Support**: 0.1667, 0.1845
- **Train Confidence**: 0.6352, 0.5396
- **Train Lift**: 1.2048, 1.0559
- **Train Leverage**: 0.0289, -0.0041

### Current Metrics

- **Train Support**: 0.0242
- **Train Confidence**: 0.7308
- **Train Lift**: 1.4690
- **Train Leverage**: 0.0099

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. **Support**

- **Observation**: The **train support** has decreased from an average of approximately **17.6%** in previous rules to **2.42%** in the current rules.
- **Implication**: The current rules apply to a smaller subset of the training data. While this could indicate that the rules are focusing on more specific cases, it also means that they may not be capturing a significant portion of the dataset.

### 2. **Confidence**

- **Observation**: **Train confidence** has increased from an average of **58.74%** to **73.08%**.
- **Implication**: When the conditions of the current rules are met, there is a higher likelihood that the predicted outcome (high yield) is correct. This indicates an improvement in the rules' predictive accuracy within the covered subset.

### 3. **Lift**

- **Observation**: **Train lift** has increased from an average of **1.1304** to **1.4690**.
- **Implication**: The higher lift signifies that the current rules are better at identifying high yield outcomes compared to random chance. The predictions are approximately 1.469 times more likely than baseline probability.

### 4. **Leverage**

- **Observation**: **Train leverage** has slightly decreased from an average of **0.0124** to **0.0099**.
- **Implication**: Positive leverage indicates a stronger association than expected by chance. The slight decrease suggests that while the rules are better at predicting high yield when the conditions are met, they contribute marginally less additional support over expectations.

## Interpretation

- **Trade-Off Between Support and Confidence**: The increase in confidence and lift comes with a significant decrease in support. This suggests that the rules have become more specialized, accurately predicting high yield in fewer cases.
- **Potential Overfitting**: Focusing on specific conditions that yield high confidence may lead to overfitting, where the rules perform well on the training data but may not generalize to unseen data.
- **Local Minimum**: The current approach seems to have reached a point where further iterations yield diminishing returns, especially in terms of support. This indicates a possible local minimum in the optimization of the rules.

## Metrics During Iterations

Analyzing the metrics from previous iterations can provide insights into trends:

1. **First Iteration**:
   - **Train Support**: 0.0095
   - **Train Confidence**: 0.6111
   - **Train Lift**: 1.2162
   - **Leverage**: 0.0047

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - **Train Support**: 0.1657
   - **Train Confidence**: 0.5650
   - **Train Lift**: 1.1248
   - **Leverage**: 0.0045

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - **Train Support**: 0.0
   - **Train Confidence**: 0.5
   - **Train Lift**: 1.0
   - **Leverage**: 0.0

4. **Current Iteration**:
   - **Train Support**: 0.0242
   - **Train Confidence**: 0.7308
   - **Train Lift**: 1.4690
   - **Leverage**: 0.0099

**Trend Analysis**:

- **Fluctuations in Support**: There is inconsistency in support across iterations, indicating instability in the rules' applicability.
- **Increase in Confidence and Lift**: The latest iteration shows the highest confidence and lift, emphasizing improved predictive power for specific conditions.
- **Zero Support in Third Iteration**: Indicates an iteration where the rules did not apply to any data points, underscoring the risk of over-specialization.

## Improvement Suggestions

To enhance the current rules and achieve a better balance between support, confidence, and lift, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Expand Rule Applicability**

- **Broaden Conditions**: Relax overly restrictive conditions in the rules to cover a larger portion of the dataset.
  - *Example*: Instead of specifying "chain lengths of five carbons or fewer," consider "chain lengths of seven carbons or fewer" if it doesn't significantly reduce confidence.
- **Include More Examples**: Use data from additional high-yield cases to refine and generalize the rules.

### 2. **Optimize Rule Complexity**

- **Simplify Rules**: Remove or combine overlapping rules to reduce complexity and avoid fragmentation.
  - *Example*: Merge Rules 1 and 4 if they cover similar compounds with minor differences.
- **Prioritize High-Impact Features**: Focus on the most significant molecular features affecting yield.

### 3. **Balance Support and Confidence**

- **Adjust Weighting**: Modify the criteria for rule inclusion to find a balance between high confidence and reasonable support.
- **Iterative Testing**: Conduct multiple iterations, adjusting parameters to observe changes in metrics.

### 4. **Validate with Test Data**

- **Assessment on Unseen Data**: Evaluate the rules on a separate test set to check generalizability.
- **Monitor Overfitting**: Ensure that improvements in training metrics correspond to performance on test data.

### 5. **Incorporate Domain Expertise**

- **Consult Experts**: Collaborate with chemists to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules.
- **Integrate Theoretical Knowledge**: Use established chemical principles to guide rule adjustments.

### 6. **Enhance Feature Representation**

- **Add Relevant Features**: Include additional molecular descriptors that may capture important variations.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use techniques like principal component analysis to identify key features.

### 7. **Employ Machine Learning Techniques**

- **Classification Algorithms**: Utilize decision trees or random forests to uncover patterns not apparent through manual rule creation.
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine rule-based methods with machine learning models for improved performance.

### 8. **Regularize Rule Creation**

- **Avoid Over-Specialization**: Implement constraints to prevent rules from becoming too specific.
- **Promote Generality**: Encourage the development of rules that apply to broader cases without severely compromising accuracy.

### 9. **Monitor Changes Across Iterations**

- **Track Metric Evolution**: Keep detailed records of how metrics change with each iteration to identify successful adjustments.
- **Set Thresholds**: Establish acceptable ranges for each metric to guide rule development.

### 10. **Re-express Rules**

- **Alternative Formulations**: Rephrase rules to explore different perspectives on the data.
  - *Example*: Instead of focusing on the presence of a functional group, consider its absence in non-performing modifiers.

## Conclusion

The current rules demonstrate improved predictive accuracy within a narrow scope, as evidenced by increased confidence and lift. However, the significant decrease in support highlights a need for broader applicability.

To improve the rules:

- **Aim for Balance**: Strive to increase support while maintaining acceptable confidence and lift levels.
- **Iterate Thoughtfully**: Make incremental adjustments based on metric feedback and domain knowledge.
- **Validate Rigorously**: Test rules on unseen data to ensure they generalize well and truly capture underlying patterns.

By implementing these strategies, the rules can be refined to better predict high yield outcomes across a more substantial portion of the dataset, enhancing their practical utility in the research program.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current set of rules:

1. **Accuracy Metrics**:
   - **Current Validation Accuracy**: The 5-fold cross-validation accuracy is **0.5714**, which is lower than the reference validation accuracies of **0.76** and previous iterations ranging from **0.68 to 0.76**.
   - **Trend**: The decrease in accuracy compared to previous iterations suggests that the current rules are **less effective** in accurately predicting the loading of modifiers on the catalyst.

2. **Effectiveness of Current Rules**:
   - The reduced accuracy indicates that the current rules are **not sufficiently capturing the patterns and relationships** in the data that determine high or low loading outcomes.
   - The rules may be **overly generalized or misaligned** with the key structural features influencing catalyst performance.

3. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment**:
   - **Underfitting**: The comparatively low validation accuracy suggests that the model is **underfitting** the data. It is not complex enough or lacks the necessary detail to model the underlying relationship between molecular features and catalyst loading effectively.
   - The current rules may be **too simplistic or broad**, failing to capture important nuances in the data.

4. **Discrepancies Identified Through SHAP Analysis**:
   - **Underestimated Loadings**: Several molecules with **high experimental loading** are being **predicted as low loading** by the model.
     - **Examples**:
       - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O** (4-bromobenzoic acid)
       - **C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O** (2-carboxypyridine-4-carboxylic acid)
       - **C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)O** (nicotinic acid)
     - **Contributing Rules**:
       - **Rule 1**, **Rule 2**, and **Rule 5** have **high negative SHAP values**, indicating they are contributing significantly to the underestimation.
       - **Rule 3** is not contributing positively as expected for heteroaromatic carboxylic acids.

   - **Overestimated Loadings**: There are fewer instances, but some molecules with **low experimental loading** are being **predicted as high loading**.
     - **Contributing Rules**:
       - **Rules with high positive SHAP values** may be overestimating contributions for these modifiers, although specific rules contributing were not highlighted in the provided data.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis**:
   - **Rule 1** (Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids or aminodicarboxylic acids) is contributing negatively to molecules where it should not apply, such as aromatic carboxylic acids.
   - **Rule 2** (Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para-position) is contributing negatively instead of positively for molecules like 4-bromobenzoic acid, which should result in high loading.
   - **Rule 3** (Heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms) appears inactive or ineffective for molecules like nicotinic acid, where it should contribute positively.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the effectiveness of the current rules and improve the model's predictive performance, the following actions are recommended:

1. **Refine Problematic Rules**:

   - **Rule 1**:
     - **Issue**: Negative SHAP contributions to molecules where the rule should not apply.
     - **Recommendation**: **Narrow the scope** of Rule 1 to ensure it only applies to appropriate modifiers.
       - **Action**: Add more specific criteria to exclude aromatic carboxylic acids and other unrelated structures.

   - **Rule 2**:
     - **Issue**: Negative SHAP contributions for modifiers like 4-bromobenzoic acid, which should be predicted as high loading.
     - **Recommendation**: **Re-evaluate the descriptors** used in Rule 2 to ensure proper identification of electron-withdrawing substituents and their impact.
       - **Action**: Adjust the rule to **correctly capture halogen substituents** (e.g., bromine) at the para-position and their electron-withdrawing effects.

   - **Rule 3**:
     - **Issue**: Lack of positive SHAP contribution for heteroaromatic acids such as nicotinic acid.
     - **Recommendation**: **Verify and improve feature extraction** for heteroaromatic compounds with coordinating nitrogen atoms.
       - **Action**: Ensure that the rule's implementation correctly recognizes nitrogen atoms in the aromatic ring connected to the carboxyl group.

   - **Rule 5**:
     - **Issue**: Negative SHAP contributions where not appropriate.
     - **Recommendation**: **Clarify the criteria** for polyhydroxy acids to prevent misclassification.
       - **Action**: Refine the definition to avoid unintended application to molecules lacking multiple hydroxyl groups on a carbohydrate backbone.

2. **Adjust Rules With High Negative SHAP Values**:

   - **Identify and Modify Rules** that consistently contribute large negative SHAP values for molecules that should be predicted as high loading.
   - **Ensure Correct Application**: Review the applicability conditions of these rules to avoid penalizing molecules they shouldn't affect.

3. **Enhance Rule Specificity and Generalization**:

   - **Increase Specificity**:
     - **Add Sub-Rules** or **Exception Clauses** to existing rules to better distinguish between similar molecules with different behaviors.
     - **Use Chemical Intuition**: Incorporate deeper chemical insights and more precise structural features.

   - **Improve Generalization**:
     - **Expand Rules** to cover additional relevant functional groups or structural motifs that were previously overlooked.
     - **Balance Complexity**: Ensure that rules are neither too broad (leading to underfitting) nor too narrow (leading to overfitting).

4. **Validate and Update Feature Encoding**:

   - **Check Implementation**:
     - **Ensure Accurate Encoding**: Verify that the structural features and functional groups specified in the rules are correctly encoded in the feature matrix.
     - **Map Molecules Correctly**: Cross-reference each molecule to confirm that all applicable rules are triggered as intended.

   - **Use Computational Tools**:
     - Utilize cheminformatics software to **automatically detect functional groups** and substructures based on the updated rules.

5. **Incorporate Additional Relevant Rules**:

   - **Analyze Misclassified Molecules**:
     - **For Underestimated Loadings**: Investigate common features among molecules with high experimental loading but low predicted loading to identify missing rules.
     - **For Overestimated Loadings**: Do the same for molecules with low experimental loading but high predicted loading.

   - **Develop New Rules**:
     - **Based on SHAP Insights**: Propose new rules or modify existing ones where SHAP analysis indicates significant positive or negative contributions.

6. **Iterative Refinement and Evaluation**:

   - **Retrain the Model**:
     - After adjusting the rules, retrain the model and evaluate performance using cross-validation.
     - **Monitor Accuracy Metrics**: Aim for an increase in validation accuracy toward or beyond the previous baseline of 0.76.

   - **Continuous SHAP Analysis**:
     - **Assess the Impact** of changes on SHAP values to ensure that rule adjustments lead to desired contributions.
     - **Fine-Tune Rules**: Iteratively refine rules based on SHAP feedback until convergence is achieved.

7. **Address Potential Overfitting/Underfitting**:

   - **Complexity Management**:
     - **Avoid Over-Complicating**: While adding specificity, be cautious not to create overly complex rules that fit the training data too closely.
     - **Simplicity with Accuracy**: Strive for rules that improve accuracy without unnecessary complexity.

   - **Data Augmentation**:
     - If feasible, **expand the dataset** with additional examples to provide more information for the model to learn from.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules shows limitations in effectively predicting catalyst modifier performance, as evidenced by decreased validation accuracy and discrepancies highlighted through SHAP analysis. By refining problematic rules, enhancing specificity, and ensuring correct feature encoding, it is possible to improve the model's predictive capabilities. Iterative refinement, guided by both chemical intuition and SHAP insights, will help achieve a more accurate and generalizable set of rules, ultimately leading to better catalyst design and optimization.

**Summary and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current set of rules aims to predict the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols, modified by different molecular modifiers. An analysis of the rule performance using various metrics (support, confidence, lift, leverage) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values has identified several areas where rules can be improved to enhance predictive accuracy without overfitting.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Decreased Validation Accuracy**: The current validation accuracy is significantly lower than previous iterations, indicating that the rules are less effective in accurately predicting the outcome.

2. **Low Support and Confidence**: Some rules have low support and confidence, meaning they apply to a small subset of data and are less reliable in making accurate predictions.

3. **Negative SHAP Contributions**: Certain rules are contributing negatively to the prediction of high yield for modifiers known experimentally to result in high yield.

4. **Possible Underfitting**: The model appears to be underfitting, suggesting that the rules are too simplistic or not capturing the necessary chemical features.

**Directions for Optimization:**

To improve the current rules, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Refine and Correct SMARTS Patterns:**

   - **Rule 1**: Update the pattern matching for side-chain functional groups in amino acids to ensure that modifiers with relevant functional groups on the side chain are correctly identified. Use more specific substructure searches that focus on functional groups attached to the α-carbon of amino acids.

   - **Rule 2**: Correct the SMARTS pattern for the bromomethyl group to `'[cH1][CH2Br]'` and enforce positional specificity to ensure the electron-withdrawing group is at the para-position relative to the carboxylic acid.

   - **Rule 3**: Generalize the SMARTS pattern for heteroaromatic carboxylic acids to capture a wider range of structures, ensuring that nitrogen atoms capable of coordination are correctly identified in various heteroaromatic systems.

   - **Rule 4**: Adjust the code to ensure that only linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar functional groups are matched. Exclude molecules with hydroxyl or amino groups by incorporating these patterns into exclusion criteria.

   - **Rule 5**: Modify the pattern to specifically identify polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (sugar acids) by ensuring multiple hydroxyl groups are present on adjacent carbons, reflecting the carbohydrate backbone.

   - **Rule 6**: Expand the indole ring pattern to include other aromatic systems with coordinating heteroatoms, such as imidazole rings in histidine, ensuring that amino acids with such features are correctly identified.

   - **Rule 7**: Update the patterns for aldehyde and ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings to `'[c][CX3H1](=O)'` and `'[c][CX3](=O)[c]'` to accurately capture functional groups directly attached to the aromatic system.

   - **Rule 9**: Modify the pattern for fluorinated alkyl chains to `'[CX4]([F])([F])([F])'` and account for longer perfluorinated chains, ensuring correct identification of highly fluorinated modifiers.

2. **Increase Positional Specificity:**

   - Implement precise positional specificity in SMARTS patterns where necessary, particularly for substituents at the para-position. This can be achieved by crafting patterns that enforce the spatial relationship between functional groups.

3. **Enhance Rule Specificity and Generalization:**

   - **Balance Specificity and Generality**: Adjust rules to be specific enough to accurately predict outcomes but general enough to apply to a broader set of modifiers without overfitting.

   - **Use Chemical Intuition**: Incorporate deeper chemical insights into the rules, considering electron-donating/withdrawing effects, steric factors, and coordination chemistry principles.

4. **Address Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**

   - **Identify Problematic Rules**: Rules contributing high negative SHAP values to correct predictions should be reviewed and refined.

   - **Adjust Rule Conditions**: Modify the conditions of these rules to prevent them from negatively impacting predictions where they should not apply.

5. **Validate and Update Feature Encoding:**

   - **Ensure Accurate Encoding**: Verify that all structural features and functional groups specified in the rules are correctly encoded in the feature matrix.

   - **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation to assess the impact of rule changes on model performance and prevent overfitting.

6. **Iterative Refinement:**

   - **Retrain the Model**: After making adjustments, retrain the model and evaluate performance metrics to assess improvements.

   - **Monitor Metrics**: Keep track of accuracy, support, confidence, lift, and leverage to ensure that rule changes are positively impacting model performance.

7. **Improve Documentation and Code Structure:**

   - **Add Comments**: Include clear comments and documentation within the code to explain each SMARTS pattern and the logic behind it.

   - **Maintainability**: Organized and well-documented code facilitates future modifications and understanding.

**Possibility for Further Optimization**

Given the observations and the potential improvements identified, there is a strong possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By addressing the specific issues in rule definitions and implementations, refining SMARTS patterns, and incorporating chemical knowledge, the model can achieve higher accuracy and better generalization.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic amino acids* or *aminodicarboxylic acids* with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer and side-chain functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl) result in **high yield**; similar longer-chain amino acids or those lacking side-chain functional groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Short-chain amino acids with coordinating side-chain groups are better positioned to chelate metal centers due to proximity and reduced flexibility. This enhances catalyst activity by promoting strong ligand-metal interactions. Longer chains increase flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing coordination efficiency and catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with strongly electron-withdrawing groups capable of coordination (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups or groups that hinder coordination result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and may facilitate stronger coordination with metal centers. They can also participate directly in coordination if they possess lone pairs (e.g., nitro groups). Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and may introduce steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heteroaromatic carboxylic acids* with nitrogen atoms in the ring capable of coordinating to metal centers result in **high yield**; those lacking coordinating heteroatoms or with the carboxyl group disconnected from the heterocycle result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing chelation with metal centers. This dual coordination strengthens metal-ligand interactions, improving catalyst performance. If the carboxyl group is not directly attached to the heterocycle, the potential for such synergistic coordination is diminished.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (six carbons or more) *without polar functional groups* result in **high yield**; introduction of polar groups such as hydroxyl or amino leads to **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Non-polar long-chain acids can enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst framework, potentially stabilizing the active metal center and facilitating substrate access. Polar substituents introduce hydrogen bonding and can disrupt these hydrophobic interactions, possibly leading to catalyst deactivation or reduced activity.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing *multiple hydroxyl groups* on a carbohydrate backbone (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**; modifiers with ether linkages or single hydroxyl groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through multidentate chelation. Ether linkages introduce chain flexibility and are weaker ligands, reducing effective coordination due to entropic factors and less favorable conformations.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with aromatic side chains* containing heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., indole nitrogen in tryptophan) result in **high yield**; those with non-coordinating aromatic side chains result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in the side chain (like the nitrogen in indole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing the overall chelation and stability of the catalyst. Aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms do not contribute additional coordination sites and may not enhance catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing *aldehyde or ketone groups* adjacent to aromatic rings result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions and interference with coordination.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde and ketone groups can undergo side reactions, such as imine formation with amines present in the reaction mixture, reducing the effective concentration of the modifier. Additionally, these groups may interfere with metal coordination by competing for binding sites or altering electronic properties unfavorably.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing *sulfur atoms*, especially *thiol groups* in aromatic systems, result in **low yield** due to potential poisoning of the metal catalyst.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Sulfur-containing groups, particularly thiols, have a high affinity for metal centers and can bind irreversibly, deactivating the catalyst by forming stable metal-sulfur bonds. This diminishes the availability of active sites necessary for the desired catalytic reaction.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with *fluorinated alkyl chains* result in **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability and increased hydrophobicity, which can hinder interaction with the metal center.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorination enhances the electron-withdrawing nature of the alkyl chain, reducing the electron density on potential coordinating atoms. This weakens ligand-metal interactions. Additionally, highly fluorinated chains are exceptionally hydrophobic, which may impede effective integration into a mostly organic catalyst framework.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *bulky electron-donating groups* at the *para-position* (e.g., methyl, methoxy) result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky electron-donating substituents can sterically hinder the approach of the modifier to the metal center and decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, making metal coordination less favorable. This reduces the effectiveness of the modifier in enhancing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with *ether linkages* in aliphatic chains and lacking additional strong coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are relatively weak ligands, and the flexibility introduced by ether linkages leads to entropic disadvantages in forming stable metal-ligand complexes. Without stronger coordinating groups to compensate, these modifiers are less effective in enhancing catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *cyclic compounds with multiple carbonyl groups* capable of chelation (e.g., cyclic anhydrides or lactones) result in **high yield** due to enhanced multidentate coordination.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Rigid cyclic structures with multiple carbonyl groups can act as chelating ligands, forming strong and stable complexes with metal centers. This multidentate binding enhances catalyst stability and activity by firmly anchoring the metal within the catalyst framework.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers combining *ketone functional groups* with neighboring carboxylic acids in aliphatic chains result in **low yield** due to potential interference with coordination and increased chain flexibility.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The presence of ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids may form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or interact unfavorably with the metal center, reducing effective coordination. The increased flexibility of the aliphatic chain can also decrease the likelihood of simultaneous coordination of both functional groups.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 1's SMARTS pattern** to specifically match short-chain aliphatic amino acids and aminodicarboxylic acids with coordinating side-chain functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl). Ensure that the side-chain functional groups are correctly identified as being attached to the α-carbon. Use a SMARTS pattern like `'N[C@@H](C(=O)O)[C;H2][C;H2][C](=O)O'` to capture amino acids like aspartic acid and glutamic acid, and exclude longer chains or those lacking side-chain functional groups.

- **Advice 2**: **Correct Rule 2's SMARTS pattern** for para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups. Adjust the pattern to enforce positional specificity at the para-position relative to the carboxylic acid. For example, use `'O=C(O)c1ccc([NX3;v3][O-])cc1'` for nitro groups or `'O=C(O)c1ccc(CBr)cc1'` for bromomethyl groups, ensuring only modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing substituents at the para-position are matched.

- **Advice 3**: **Generalize Rule 3's SMARTS pattern** for heteroaromatic carboxylic acids by including various nitrogen-containing heterocycles capable of metal coordination. Use patterns like `'n1cccc1C(=O)O'` for pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, `'n1nccc1C(=O)O'` for pyrazine carboxylic acids, and include other relevant heterocycles to capture a broader range of coordinating modifiers.

- **Advice 4**: **Adjust Rule 4's code** to match only long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar functional groups. Use a SMARTS pattern like `'C(=O)OCCCCCC'` to represent chains of six carbons or more and incorporate negation patterns to exclude modifiers with hydroxyl or amino groups, such as `'!@[OH, NH2]'`, ensuring only non-polar long-chain acids are identified.

- **Advice 5**: **Modify Rule 5's pattern** to specifically identify polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (sugar acids) with multiple hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons. Use a SMARTS pattern like `'C(=O)O[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)CO'` to capture gluconic acid and similar compounds, ensuring accurate identification of modifiers with a carbohydrate backbone.

- **Advice 6**: **Expand Rule 6's SMARTS pattern** to include amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms beyond tryptophan, such as histidine. Use patterns like `'N[C@@H](C(=O)O)CC1=CN=CN1'` for histidine, ensuring that all amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains capable of coordinating to metal centers are included.

- **Advice 7**: **Update Rule 7's SMARTS patterns** for aldehyde and ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings to accurately capture these functionalities. Use patterns like `'O=CHc1ccccc1C(=O)O'` for aldehydes and `'O=Cc1ccccc1C(=O)O'` for ketones, ensuring correct identification of modifiers that may interfere with coordination due to reactive carbonyl groups.

- **Advice 8**: **Modify Rule 9's SMARTS pattern** to include longer perfluorinated alkyl chains. Use a pattern like `'C(F)(F)F'` to match trifluoromethyl groups and extend it to match longer chains, such as `'C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(=O)O'` for perfluorinated carboxylic acids, ensuring accurate identification of highly fluorinated modifiers.

- **Advice 9**: **Increase positional specificity** in SMARTS patterns where the position of substituents is critical. For example, in aromatic rings, use patterns that define the relative positions of substituents, such as `'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)X'`, where `X` is the specific substituent at the desired position, enforcing the spatial relationship necessary for correct matching.

- **Advice 10**: **Review and adjust rules contributing high negative SHAP values** by refining their conditions or adding exceptions to prevent them from negatively impacting accurate predictions. Ensure that these rules are only applied to modifiers where the conditions genuinely lead to low yield, preventing misclassification of high-yield modifiers.

- **Advice 11**: **Verify feature encoding accuracy** to ensure that all structural features and functional groups specified in the rules are correctly represented in the feature matrix. Cross-check the molecular descriptors and patterns used in the rules against the encoded features to eliminate discrepancies.

- **Advice 12**: **Implement cross-validation** after making rule adjustments to assess the impact on model performance and avoid overfitting. Retrain the model with the updated rules and evaluate performance metrics such as accuracy, support, confidence, lift, and leverage to ensure that changes lead to genuine improvements.

- **Advice 13**: **Enhance documentation and code structure** by adding clear comments explaining the purpose and logic of each SMARTS pattern and rule. This will improve code maintainability and facilitate future revisions or expansions of the ruleset, ensuring that the rationale behind each rule is transparent and accessible.

The rule has appropriate complexity and is supported by multiple data points, demonstrating good coverage.

---

- **Comment 14**:

  **Rule 14** indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to catalyst poisoning. The example (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid) corresponds to a low-yield data point. The physical-chemical insight is solid. However, the rule's coverage is limited to one data point, reducing its robustness. Additional supporting examples would enhance confidence in the rule.

---

- **Comment 15**:

  **Rule 15** suggests that modifiers with complex structures containing multiple functional groups that may interfere with coordination tend to result in low yield. The examples provided (4-oxoheptanedioic acid and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid) align with low-yield data points. While the physical-chemical rationale is understandable, the rule lacks specificity, making clarity an issue. The rule covers at least two data points but could be improved by specifying which functional groups interfere with coordination.

**TRUE**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify Structural Descriptors**  
  Replace qualitative descriptors in the rules with quantifiable structural features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For example, instead of terms like "short-chain" or "long-chain," specify the exact carbon chain length (e.g., chain length ≤ 5 carbons for short-chain, chain length ≥ 6 carbons for long-chain). Use specific counts of functional groups (e.g., number of carboxylate groups, presence of amino groups) to make rules precise and quantifiable.

- **Advice 2**: **Use Computationally Detectable Substructures**  
  Define rules using substructure patterns or SMARTS queries that can be computationally matched in the SMILES strings. This approach allows for automatic feature extraction and facilitates the generation of a numerical feature matrix. For instance, specify the presence of specific ring systems, functional groups, or heteroatoms using SMARTS patterns.

- **Advice 3**: **Consolidate Similar Rules for Simplicity**  
  Merge rules that share common features to reduce redundancy and complexity. For example, combine rules related to aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating functional groups into a single rule with clearly defined subcategories based on the type of coordinating group (e.g., amino, nitro, halogens).

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors**  
  Utilize molecular descriptors that are easily computable from SMILES strings, such as molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and counts of specific atom types or bonds. Base the rules on these descriptors to create quantifiable criteria that correlate with yield outcomes.

- **Advice 5**: **Define Coordination Ability Numerically**  
  Since coordination ability affects yield, quantify it using parameters like the number of potential donor atoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur atoms) and their connectivity. Assign numerical values or thresholds for coordination sites (e.g., modifiers with ≥2 donor atoms result in high yield).

- **Advice 6**: **Avoid Ambiguous Terminology**  
  Eliminate terms that are subjective or difficult to quantify, such as "capable of coordinating" or "interfere with coordination." Instead, specify the exact functional groups or atomic environments responsible for coordination or interference, and define them in a way that can be detected computationally.

- **Advice 7**: **Create a Feature Matrix Template**  
  Develop a template for a numerical feature matrix that lists all relevant structural features (e.g., counts of specific functional groups, presence of rings, chain lengths). Ensure that each feature corresponds to a quantifiable property extracted from the SMILES strings.

- **Advice 8**: **Utilize Cheminformatics Tools**  
  Implement cheminformatics software and libraries (e.g., RDKit) to automate the extraction of molecular features from SMILES strings. Use these tools to calculate descriptors and identify substructures, which can then be used to refine the rules based on actual data.

- **Advice 9**: **Reevaluate and Update Rules Based on Data Patterns**  
  Analyze the dataset to identify patterns and correlations between specific molecular features and yield outcomes. Update the rules to reflect these findings, ensuring that they are data-driven and relevant to the observed results.

- **Advice 10**: **Provide Examples with SMILES Notation**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the rules by focusing on specific functional groups and structural motifs that can be directly identified in SMILES strings.** Avoid complex chemical terminology and generalize the rules to emphasize easily extractable features such as the presence of specific atoms, functional groups, or ring systems.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate overlapping or similar rules to reduce redundancy and streamline the rule set.** For example, combine rules that involve aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating substituents into a single, more general rule that highlights the key structural features leading to high yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Define rules using SMARTS patterns to enable automated extraction of relevant features from SMILES strings.** SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification) allows for precise specification of substructures, making it easier to generate a numerical feature matrix based on the presence or absence of these patterns.

- **Advice 4**: **Emphasize quantifiable properties and structural counts in the rules.** For instance, base rules on the number of coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur), the degree of carboxylate substitution, or the presence of specific functional groups that can be counted and encoded numerically.

- **Advice 5**: **Remove overly specific examples and focus on generalizable structural features.** Instead of listing specific compounds, describe the general characteristics (e.g., "Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group adjacent to a nitrogen heterocycle result in high yield") to make the rules more broadly applicable.

- **Advice 6**: **Clarify and standardize terminology used in the rules to ensure consistency in feature extraction.** Provide clear definitions for terms like "electron-withdrawing groups," "coordination sites," and "heteroaromatic," so they can be systematically applied when analyzing new modifiers.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate molecular descriptors and properties that can be calculated from SMILES strings into the rules.** Utilize parameters like LogP, pKa, molecular weight, and topological polar surface area (TPSA) to create rules that are both quantifiable and relevant to the reaction yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Consider the steric and electronic effects of substituents in the rules by using parameters such as Hammett sigma values or Taft steric constants.** These values can be correlated with electronic properties and steric hindrance, providing a numerical basis for the rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Create a decision tree or flowchart based on structural features to categorize modifiers into high or low yield groups.** This approach can simplify the rules into a sequence of yes/no questions that are easy to program and translate into a feature matrix.

- **Advice 10**: **Engage in feature selection to identify the most impactful structural elements influencing the yield.** Use statistical methods or machine learning to determine which features have the strongest correlation with high or low yields, and update the rules accordingly.

- **Advice 1**: **Strengthen Rules Supported by Limited Data Points**

  - **Action**: Re-evaluate rules that are currently supported by only one data point (e.g., Rules 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15). Investigate whether additional modifiers with similar structural features can be included to reinforce these rules.
  - **Example**: For Rule 4 (Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group result in high yield), search for more modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups that have been tested and include them to support or refine the rule.

- **Advice 2**: **Merge Similar Rules to Enhance Coverage and Clarity**

  - **Action**: Identify and combine rules that address similar structural features or chemical principles to improve coverage and reduce redundancy.
  - **Example**: Merge Rule 2 (aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para-position resulting in high yield) and Rule 9 (aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups resulting in low yield) into a single rule that emphasizes the effect of substituents' electronic nature on yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Broaden Narrow Rules by Generalizing Structural Features**

  - **Action**: Generalize rules that are too specific by focusing on broader structural characteristics, thereby increasing their applicability.
  - **Example**: For Rule 15 (simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield), extend the rule to include aliphatic carboxylic acids of various chain lengths and assess their yields to determine if the rule holds more broadly.

- **Advice 4**: **Increase Specificity in Vague Rules**

  - **Action**: Refine rules that are overly broad or lack specificity by adding clear criteria and detailed descriptors.
  - **Example**: Rule 14 (Modifiers with complex or bulky structures result in low yield) can be improved by specifying which functional groups or structural motifs contribute to steric hindrance or coordination interference.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Additional Data to Validate and Refine Rules**

  - **Action**: Collect more experimental data for modifiers that fit underrepresented categories to validate existing rules or adjust them based on new findings.
  - **Example**: Test additional perfluorinated carboxylic acids to confirm the validity of Rule 6 or modify the rule based on the new data.

- **Advice 6**: **Ensure Rules Are Distinct and Non-Overlapping**

  - **Action**: Review the rules to eliminate overlaps and ensure each rule addresses unique structural features to prevent confusion.
  - **Example**: Differentiate between Rules 7 and 12 by clearly defining the presence or absence of coordinating heteroatoms in amino acid side chains, ensuring they address distinct scenarios.

- **Advice 7**: **Enhance Rules with SMILES-Compatible Structural Descriptors**

  - **Action**: Define the structural features in terms that can be directly identified from SMILES strings to facilitate computational analysis.
  - **Example**: Use specific SMILES patterns to represent functional groups (e.g., "[NH2]" for amino groups, "C(=O)O" for carboxyl groups) within the rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Thresholds and Quantitative Criteria**

  - **Action**: Add specific thresholds (e.g., chain length, number of coordinating atoms) to rules that depend on quantitative aspects to improve predictability.
  - **Example**: In Rule 8, specify that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with more than six carbons result in low yield, providing a clear cutoff for chain length.

- **Advice 9**: **Re-evaluate Rules with Contradictory Examples**

  - **Action**: Examine any rules where exceptions or contradictory data points exist and adjust the rules accordingly.
  - **Example**: For Rule 14, since modifiers with hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring show variable yield, consider introducing sub-rules based on chain length or hydroxyl positioning to account for these differences.

- **Advice 10**: **Include More Examples in Each Rule**

  - **Action**: Provide additional supporting examples for each rule to enhance understanding and reinforce the rule's validity.
  - **Example**: In Rule 3, include more heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms that result in high yield to strengthen the rule.

- **Advice 11**: **Simplify Overly Complex Rules Where Possible**

  - **Action**: Simplify rules that may be too intricate by focusing on the most impactful structural features.
  - **Example**: If Rule 14 is too broad, consider breaking it down into more specific rules that address particular types of structural complexity affecting yield.

- **Advice 12**: **Align Rules with Physical and Chemical Principles**

  - **Action**: Ensure that all rules are grounded in well-understood chemical principles to increase their reliability and acceptance.
  - **Example**: Reaffirm the rationale behind each rule by referencing coordination chemistry principles, such as chelation effect, electronic factors, and steric hindrance.

- **Advice 13**: **Seek Input from Project Manager for Priority Adjustments**

  - **Action**: Consult with the Project Manager to identify priority areas for rule optimization based on project goals and resource availability.
  - **Example**: Focus on refining rules that are most critical for predicting high-yield modifiers in upcoming experiments or applications.

- **Advice 14**: **Implement a Structured Review Process for Rules**

  - **Action**: Establish a systematic approach for reviewing and updating rules as new data becomes available.
  - **Example**: Schedule regular meetings to assess the performance of current rules and incorporate new experimental results to continuously improve the rule set.

- **Advice 15**: **Provide Training or Guidelines for Rule Application**

  - **Action**: Develop documentation or training materials to assist users in applying the rules correctly when selecting or designing molecular modifiers.
  - **Example**: Create a user manual that includes detailed explanations, visual aids, and step-by-step instructions for utilizing the rules effectively.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (3 to 6 carbons) with additional *strong coordinating groups* such as *amino*, *carboxyl*, or *thiol groups* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Short-chain aliphatic acids with additional coordinating functional groups enhance metal-ligand interactions through effective chelation, improving catalyst activity and stability.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with *electron-withdrawing groups* capable of coordination (e.g., *amino*, *nitro*, *bromomethyl*) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and introduce additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heteroaromatic carboxylic acids* with *nitrogen atoms in the ring* capable of coordination result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen heterocycles serve as effective ligands, donating electron density to metal centers and stabilizing the catalyst through strong coordination.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *polyhydroxy carboxylic acids* result in **high yield** due to multiple coordination sites.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several chelation points, enhancing metal binding and improving catalyst efficiency through multidentate coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted with *aldehyde or ketone groups* result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions and interference with coordination.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde and ketone groups can undergo side reactions or compete with the carboxyl group for metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in **low yield** due to poor coordination ability.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions and diminishing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with non-coordinating aromatic side chains* (e.g., *phenylalanine*) result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms do not enhance metal binding, leading to less effective catalyst modification and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (more than six carbons) with *terminal amino or hydroxyl groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Longer aliphatic chains increase flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency and weakening metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with *electron-donating groups* (e.g., *methyl groups*) result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group and do not provide additional coordination sites, leading to weaker metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with *aromatic thiol groups* result in **low yield** due to catalyst poisoning.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic thiol groups can bind irreversibly to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst through strong metal-sulfur bonds and inhibiting catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with *ether linkages* and lacking strong coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weak ligands, and the flexibility introduced by ether linkages reduces effective coordination due to entropic factors, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with aromatic side chains* containing *coordinating heteroatoms* (e.g., the indole nitrogen in *tryptophan*) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in the side chain can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing ligand-metal interactions and improving catalyst activity through additional binding sites.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with *complex or bulky structures* that may interfere with coordination or cause steric hindrance result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky substituents and complex structures may hinder effective coordination with metal centers, reducing catalyst performance due to steric effects.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *hydroxyl groups* on the aromatic ring result in variable yield depending on *chain length* and *positioning* of the hydroxyl group.**

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The distance between the carboxyl group and the aromatic ring influences coordination efficiency; longer linkers may facilitate better interaction with the metal center, enhancing yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are *simple aliphatic carboxylic acids* without additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Simple aliphatic acids may provide optimal spacing and minimal steric hindrance, allowing effective coordination with the metal center and promoting catalytic activity.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the resulting yield of the reaction. Each rule combines multiple functional group features and considers underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, and steric factors.

By following these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural characteristics. The rules prioritize broad coverage of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity, providing clear guidance for selecting or designing modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Implement Position-Specific Matching for Substituents**

  The current code does not handle position-specific substituents, as seen in Rules 2 and 9, where substituents are required at the **para-position** of an aromatic ring. To improve the code, you should implement position-specific matching using SMARTS patterns that specify the substituent's position relative to the carboxylic acid group on the aromatic ring. For example:

  - **For para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids (Rules 2 and 9)**:
    - Use SMARTS patterns like `[$(c1ccc([#6])[c]1),$(c1cc([#6])cc([#6])c1)]` where substitutions at specific positions can be defined.
    - Alternatively, define a SMARTS pattern that matches an aromatic ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4.

  Implementing accurate position-specific matching ensures that the rules correctly identify molecules that meet the criteria.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Enhance the SMARTS Pattern for Perfluorinated Chains**

  In Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern for `perfluorinated_chain` (`'[CX4]([F])[F]'`) is insufficient to detect perfluorinated carboxylic acids, as it only matches carbon atoms with two fluorines attached. Perfluorinated chains often have all hydrogens replaced by fluorines. To improve detection:

  - Use a recursive SMARTS pattern to match perfluorinated alkyl chains, such as:
    - `'[CX4]([F])([F])([F])'` for trifluoromethyl groups.
    - `'[CX4;$(C(F)(F)(F))][CX4;$(C(F)(F)(F))]*[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` to match perfluorinated chains attached to carboxylic acid groups.
  - Consider patterns that account for longer perfluorinated chains by matching multiple CF2 units.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Implement Chain Length and Substituent Position Logic**

  For Rule 14, the code currently skips the `chain_length_effect` constraint. To accurately reflect the rule:

  - **Measure the chain length** between the carboxylic acid group and the aromatic ring.
  - **Determine the position** of the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring (e.g., ortho, meta, para).
  - Use RDKit's `GetShortestPath()` or similar methods to calculate distances between atoms.
  - Adjust the prediction based on the chain length and hydroxyl group positioning as specified in the rule.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Refine the Complexity Constraint for Rule 13**

  The placeholder of considering molecules with more than 15 heavy atoms as complex may not accurately reflect molecular complexity. To improve this:

  - Utilize molecular descriptors such as **TopoPSA**, **Fraction of Sp3 carbons**, or **Molecular Weight**.
  - Calculate the **Balaban's J index** or **Bertz complexity index** using RDKit's descriptors.
  - Define a threshold based on these descriptors to classify a molecule's complexity more effectively.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Clarify Additional Functional Groups in Rule 1**

  In Rule 1, the `additional` patterns include `carboxylic_acid`, but since it's already in `required`, this might be redundant. If the intention is to identify molecules with **multiple carboxylic acid groups** (i.e., dicarboxylic acids), explicitly specify this:

  - Create a SMARTS pattern that matches molecules with **two or more carboxylic acid groups**.
  - Use `mol.GetSubstructMatches()` to count the number of matches and ensure it meets the required count.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Accurately Count Carbons in Aliphatic Chains**

  For Rules 1 and 8, it's important to count the number of carbons in the **longest aliphatic chain** rather than the total number of carbons:

  - Use RDKit's `Chem.GetMolFrags()` and `Chem.rdmolops.GetShortestPath()` to identify and measure the longest chain.
  - Implement logic to exclude carbons in side chains or rings when counting.
  - This will ensure that the carbon count accurately reflects the molecule's chain length as intended in the rules.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Expand Excluded Functional Groups in Rule 11**

  In Rule 11, the exclusion of strong coordinating groups currently includes only `amino_group` and `thiol_group`. To align with the rule:

  - Expand the `exclude` list to include other strong coordinating groups such as **carboxyl groups**, **phosphates**, or **imidazoles**.
  - Review the functional groups that are considered strong ligands and ensure they are included in the exclusions.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Generalize the SMARTS Pattern for Indole Group in Rule 12**

  The current `indole_group` SMARTS pattern may be too specific and fail to match molecules containing indole derivatives:

  - Use a more general SMARTS pattern for indole rings, such as `'c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2'`.
  - This pattern captures the essential structure of indole and allows for substitution on the ring.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Utilize RDKit's Built-in Functional Group Definitions**

  To improve the accuracy of functional group detection:

  - Use RDKit's **Functional Group Catalog** or the **RDKit Descriptors module**, which provides a comprehensive set of predefined functional groups.
  - This ensures standardized and accurate detection of functional groups across molecules.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Implement Detailed Exception Handling and Logging**

  The current exception handling simply appends `0` to the results, which can mask parsing errors:

  - Implement logging using Python's `logging` module to record errors and exceptions.
  - Provide informative messages when a molecule cannot be parsed or if an error occurs during rule processing.
  - This will help identify and resolve issues in the code or data more efficiently.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Add Aromaticity and Tautomer Considerations**

  Some molecules may not match SMARTS patterns due to aromaticity perception or tautomeric forms:

  - Use `Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi, sanitize=False)` and then apply `Chem.SanitizeMol(mol)` to better control molecule sanitization.
  - Consider generating and matching against **tautomeric forms** of the molecules if relevant to the rules.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Improve SMARTS Patterns for Functional Groups**

  Review and refine the SMARTS patterns defined at the beginning to ensure they accurately represent the functional groups:

  - Verify each SMARTS pattern against known examples to ensure correct matching.
  - Use RDKit's substructure search capabilities to test and validate these patterns.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**Overview:**

The current set of rules has been evaluated using the provided metrics, focusing on **confidence** and **lift** as key indicators of rule performance. Comparing these metrics to the previous rule metrics serves as a baseline to assess improvements or regressions in performance. Below is a detailed analysis of the current rule metrics in relation to the previous metrics, along with suggestions for improvement.

---

**1. Comparison of Metrics:**

**a. Support:**

- **Previous Train Support (Mean):** Approximately 0.175 (Average of 0.1667 and 0.1845).
- **Current Train Support:** 0.1219.

**Analysis:**

- The current rules have a **lower support** compared to the previous rules. This indicates that the current rules cover a smaller proportion of the training data.
- A lower support suggests that while the rules might be more precise, they are applicable to fewer cases within the dataset.

**b. Confidence:**

- **Previous Train Confidence (Mean):** Approximately 0.5874 (Average of 0.6352 and 0.5396).
- **Current Train Confidence:** 0.6212.

**Analysis:**

- There is a **slight increase in confidence** in the current rules compared to the previous ones.
- Higher confidence indicates that, when the rule conditions are met, the prediction is more likely to be correct.

**c. Lift:**

- **Previous Train Lift (Mean):** Approximately 1.1304 (Average of 1.2048 and 1.0559).
- **Current Train Lift:** 1.2332.

**Analysis:**

- The **lift has improved** in the current rules.
- A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. An increased lift suggests that the rules are more effective in identifying significant associations.

**d. Leverage:**

- **Previous Train Leverage (Mean):** Approximately 0.0124 (Average of 0.0289 and -0.0041).
- **Current Train Leverage:** 0.0203.

**Analysis:**

- The current rules have a **higher leverage** than the previous rules.
- Positive leverage indicates a stronger association between the rule conditions and the outcome than would be expected by chance.

---

**2. Focused Analysis on Confidence and Lift:**

**Confidence:**

- The increase in confidence from approximately 58.74% to 62.12% indicates that the current rules are making more reliable predictions when their conditions are satisfied.
- This improvement suggests better precision in the rules, potentially due to more specific conditions or better identification of key features influencing the yield.

**Lift:**

- The lift has increased from around 1.13 to 1.23.
- A higher lift signifies that the rules are more effective at identifying cases with high yield compared to random selection.
- The current lift of 1.2332 implies that the probability of achieving a high yield when the rule conditions are met is approximately 23% higher than the baseline probability.

---

**3. Implications of the Metrics:**

- **Trade-off Between Support and Confidence/Lift:**
  - The decrease in support suggests that the rules are applicable to a smaller subset of the data.
  - However, the increase in confidence and lift indicates that within this subset, the rules are more accurate and useful.
  - This trade-off is common when rules become more specific; they may apply to fewer instances but perform better in those instances.

- **Generalization vs. Specialization:**
  - The current rules might be too specialized, capturing niche cases with higher accuracy but failing to generalize across the dataset.
  - Overly specific rules may not perform well when applied to new data outside of the training set, potentially leading to lower test performance.

- **Leverage and Association Strength:**
  - The positive leverage indicates that the associations captured by the rules are meaningful and not due to random chance.
  - An increase in leverage reinforces the notion that the current rules are identifying significant patterns in the data.

---

**4. Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

- **Local Minimum:**
  - The improvements in confidence and lift suggest progress towards an optimal set of rules.
  - However, the reduction in support signals that the current set of rules may be near a local minimum in terms of overall performance.
  - To determine if a local minimum has been reached, further iterations should explore whether adjustments can maintain or improve confidence and lift while increasing support.

- **Number of Iterations:**
  - Given the limited number of iterations and the observed metrics, it appears that there is still room for improvement.
  - Additional iterations may help find a better balance between support, confidence, and lift.

---

**5. Recommendations for Improvement:**

**a. Increase Rule Coverage (Support):**

- **Objective:** Enhance support without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
- **Approach:**
  - **Combine Similar Rules:** Identify and merge rules with overlapping conditions to increase coverage.
  - **Generalize Conditions:** Slightly relax overly specific conditions to encompass more instances while maintaining accuracy.
  - **Review Low-Support Rules:** Re-evaluate rules with very low support (e.g., Rule 3 with 0% support) to determine if they should be modified or removed.

**b. Balance Specificity and Generality:**

- **Objective:** Find the optimal balance between rule specificity (leading to higher confidence and lift) and generality (leading to higher support).
- **Approach:**
  - **Feature Selection:** Identify key features that have the most significant impact on yield and focus on these in rule conditions.
  - **Avoid Overfitting:** Ensure that rules are not too tailored to the training data by validating them with a test set or through cross-validation.

**c. Enhance Rule Validity:**

- **Objective:** Improve the scientific rationale and consistency of the rules.
- **Approach:**
  - **Verify Rationale:** Ensure that each rule's rationale aligns with known chemical principles and empirical data.
  - **Update Rules Based on Data:** Adjust rules to better reflect patterns observed in the data, possibly incorporating additional relevant features.

**d. Incorporate Feedback from Test Metrics:**

- Although test metrics were not provided for the current iteration, it's crucial to assess how the rules perform on unseen data.
- **Objective:** Ensure that improvements in training metrics translate to test data performance.
- **Approach:**
  - **Obtain Test Metrics:** Evaluate the current rules on a test set to check for overfitting.
  - **Adjust Rules Accordingly:** If test performance is poor, consider simplifying rules or focusing on more robust patterns.

**e. Increase Iterations with Targeted Modifications:**

- **Objective:** Continue iterations to refine rules and achieve better performance.
- **Approach:**
  - **Targeted Experiments:** Experiment with modifying specific rules that contribute most to the reduction in support.
  - **Monitor Metrics Closely:** Keep track of how each change affects the metrics to identify positive trends.

---

**6. Specific Suggestions for Rule Improvement:**

- **Rule Evaluation:**
  - **Rule 3:** Has 0% support. Re-express or remove this rule to improve overall rule performance.
  - **Rules with Low Support but High Confidence (e.g., Rule 4):**
    - Investigate if these rules can be generalized to cover more instances without losing much confidence.

- **Consider New Features:**
  - **Functional Group Analysis:** Look for other functional groups or molecular descriptors that may influence yield.
  - **Quantitative Measures:** Incorporate quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) to refine rule conditions.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current rules show an improvement in confidence and lift compared to the previous ones, indicating better predictive accuracy when the rule conditions are met. However, the decrease in support suggests that these rules are applicable to fewer instances in the dataset.

To enhance the performance of the rules, efforts should be made to increase their applicability without compromising their accuracy. This involves carefully adjusting the specificity of the rules, combining or generalizing conditions where appropriate, and ensuring that the rules are grounded in sound chemical principles.

Further iterations are warranted to explore these adjustments. Monitoring both training and test metrics will be crucial in finding the optimal set of rules that perform well across different datasets, thereby avoiding local minima and achieving robust predictive performance.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Analysis of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results and comparing them with previous metrics, we observe the following:

1. **Validation Accuracy Improvements**:
   - **Previous Validation Accuracies**: The validation accuracies previously hovered around **0.76**, with test accuracies at **0.75** and **0.625**.
   - **Current Validation Accuracy**: The latest iteration shows a validation accuracy of **0.7429**, which is a significant improvement over the intermediate accuracies observed during iterations (0.6 to 0.57 range) but slightly below the initial baseline of 0.76.

2. **Iterative Improvements**:
   - The validation accuracy dipped in initial iterations (as low as **0.5143**), indicating potential issues with the models derived from the rules during those stages.
   - The latest model shows recovery and improvement, suggesting that the adjustments made to the rules have positively impacted the model's performance.

3. **Model Fit Assessment**:
   - The fluctuation in validation accuracies indicates that the model might have been underfitting during the intermediate iterations, failing to capture the underlying patterns.
   - The increase to **0.7429** suggests that the model is now capturing more relevant features but might still be slightly underfitting compared to the baseline accuracy of 0.76.

4. **SHAP Value Analysis**:
   - **Consistent High SHAP Values for Certain Rules**: Rules 1, 6, 8, and 13 often show high positive SHAP values in cases where the predicted loading is high.
   - **Discrepancies in Predictions**:
     - For molecules where **predicted loading is high but experimental value is low**, such as:
       - **C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F**
       - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CCCCC(=O)O)O**
       - **C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O**
     - The rules contributing most to the incorrect high predictions are those with high positive SHAP values in these cases (e.g., Rule 1, Rule 8).
   - Conversely, for molecules where **predicted loading is low but experimental value is high**, such as:
     - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**
     - **C1=CC2=C(C=C1C(=O)O)C(=O)OC2=O**
   - The rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 2) are likely contributing to the underestimation.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values**

1. **Rules Potentially Overestimating Loadings**:
   - **Rule 1**: Shows high positive SHAP values in several cases where the experimental loading is low but the model predicts high loading.
   - **Rule 8**: Also contributes high positive SHAP values in overestimations, particularly for molecules with long aliphatic chains.

2. **Rules Potentially Underestimating Loadings**:
   - **Rule 2**: Exhibits negative SHAP values in cases where the experimental loading is high but the predicted loading is low, suggesting it might be too restrictive.

3. **Consistency Across Molecules**:
   - **Rule 6**: Frequently shows positive SHAP values, indicating it significantly influences predictions toward high loading.
   - **Rule 13**: Also contributes to high loading predictions but may cause overestimations in certain cases.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Refine Rule 1**:
   - **Issue**: Rule 1 may be too broadly defined, capturing molecules that do not necessarily result in high yield.
   - **Action**:
     - Narrow down the definition to include only short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with specific coordinating groups that consistently result in high yield.
     - Exclude modifiers with additional functional groups that may interfere with coordination or introduce steric hindrance.

2. **Adjust Rule 2**:
   - **Issue**: Rule 2 might be excluding certain high-yield modifiers due to its strict criteria on substituents.
   - **Action**:
     - Reevaluate the definition of electron-withdrawing groups and consider including additional groups that have a similar effect.
     - Incorporate exceptions for molecules that have demonstrated high experimental loadings despite not strictly meeting the current criteria.

3. **Modify Rule 8**:
   - **Issue**: Rule 8 seems to contribute to overestimations when predicting high loading for long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids that, in practice, result in low yield.
   - **Action**:
     - Reinforce the rule by specifying the maximum chain length more explicitly.
     - Consider adding additional structural descriptors that account for steric hindrance and flexibility in long-chain modifiers.

4. **Review Rule 13**:
   - **Issue**: Rule 13 may be overly general in categorizing bulky or complex structures as low yield, potentially misclassifying certain modifiers.
   - **Action**:
     - Introduce subclassifications within the rule to distinguish between different types of bulky structures.
     - Use molecular descriptors such as steric parameters or molecular volume to refine the rule's applicability.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features**:
   - **Action**:
     - Include quantitative descriptors in the feature matrix, such as molecular weight, steric bulk, and electronic properties, to enhance the model's ability to generalize.
     - Utilize these descriptors to capture nuances that the current categorical rules might miss.

6. **Balance Rule Complexity**:
   - **Action**:
     - Ensure that the rules are neither too broad (causing overfitting by capturing noise) nor too narrow (leading to underfitting by missing relevant patterns).
     - Regularly validate the rules against a diverse set of molecules to test their generalizability.

7. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights**:
   - **Action**:
     - Use SHAP value patterns to identify which rules most significantly impact incorrect predictions.
     - Adjust these rules iteratively, testing the impact on validation accuracy with each change.

8. **Enhance Coordination Considerations**:
   - **Action**:
     - Reassess the coordination chemistry assumptions in the rules.
     - For example, modifiers with multiple potential coordinating sites may not always result in high yield if steric hindrance prevents effective binding.

9. **Address Overfitting**:
   - **Action**:
     - Simplify overly complex rules that may be fitting to noise in the training data.
     - Apply cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model's performance is robust across different subsets of data.

10. **Incorporate Negative Examples in Rule Testing**:
    - **Action**:
      - When refining rules, explicitly test them against molecules where they should not apply to ensure they do not incorrectly predict high loading.

**Conclusion**

By carefully analyzing the performance metrics and SHAP values, we identify specific rules that contribute to prediction errors. Refining these rules based on empirical evidence and chemical rationale will improve the model's accuracy and generalizability.

Future iterations should focus on incremental adjustments to the rules, continuously evaluating their impact on model performance. Emphasizing a balance between chemical intuition and data-driven insights will lead to a more robust set of rules that accurately predict catalyst performance.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization**

The current discussions have identified several areas where the existing rules for predicting the yield of the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction can be improved. The key points from the discussions are:

1. **Position-Specific Matching for Substituents**:
   - **Issue**: The current rules lack the ability to detect substituents at specific positions on aromatic rings (e.g., para-position in aromatic carboxylic acids).
   - **Direction**: Implement SMARTS patterns that specify the position of substituents relative to functional groups, enhancing the accuracy of rules like Rule 2 and Rule 9.

2. **Refinement of SMARTS Patterns**:
   - **Issue**: Some SMARTS patterns (e.g., for perfluorinated chains, indole groups) are insufficient or too narrow.
   - **Direction**: Enhance and generalize SMARTS patterns to accurately detect the intended functional groups, ensuring broader and more precise matching.

3. **Chain Length and Substituent Position Logic**:
   - **Issue**: Rules dependent on chain length (e.g., Rule 14) lack proper implementation of chain length measurement and positional logic.
   - **Direction**: Utilize RDKit functionalities like `GetShortestPath()` to measure chain lengths and determine substituent positions accurately.

4. **Redefinition of Molecular Complexity**:
   - **Issue**: The current measure of complexity (number of heavy atoms) is inadequate.
   - **Direction**: Incorporate molecular descriptors such as the Bertz complexity index or Balaban's J index to better assess molecular complexity in Rule 13.

5. **Accurate Carbon Counting in Aliphatic Chains**:
   - **Issue**: Inaccurate counting of carbons in aliphatic chains affects rules based on chain length.
   - **Direction**: Implement methods to accurately count carbons in the longest aliphatic chain, excluding side chains and rings, enhancing rules like Rule 1 and Rule 8.

6. **Expansion of Excluded Functional Groups**:
   - **Issue**: Exclusion lists in some rules (e.g., Rule 11) are not comprehensive.
   - **Direction**: Include all relevant strong coordinating groups in exclusion lists to prevent misclassification.

7. **Generalization of Functional Group Definitions**:
   - **Issue**: Some functional group patterns are too specific.
   - **Direction**: Use more general SMARTS patterns or RDKit's built-in functional group definitions for broader applicability.

8. **Improved Exception Handling and Logging**:
   - **Issue**: Current exception handling may mask errors in data parsing or rule application.
   - **Direction**: Implement detailed exception handling with informative logging to identify and address issues efficiently.

9. **Consideration of Aromaticity and Tautomerism**:
   - **Issue**: Some molecules may not be correctly interpreted due to aromaticity perception or tautomeric forms.
   - **Direction**: Adjust molecule sanitization and consider tautomeric forms during pattern matching.

10. **SHAP Value Analysis for Rule Adjustment**:
    - **Issue**: SHAP analysis indicates certain rules may contribute to incorrect predictions.
    - **Direction**: Use SHAP insights to identify and refine rules that negatively impact model accuracy.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Implement Position-Specific SMARTS Patterns**:
   - For rules involving positional isomers (e.g., para-substituted aromatics), define SMARTS patterns that specify substituent positions.
   - Example: Use patterns like `c1ccc(CC(=O)O)cc1` for para-substituted benzoic acids.

2. **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Perfluorinated Chains**:
   - Expand the patterns to detect longer perfluorinated chains.
   - Example: Use `[CX4](F)(F)(F)` for trifluoromethyl groups and repetitive units like `(-[CX4](F)(F)-)` for chains.

3. **Incorporate Chain Length Measurement**:
   - Use RDKit functions to calculate the number of carbons in the longest aliphatic chain.
   - Integrate this measurement into rules that depend on chain length, adjusting thresholds appropriately.

4. **Redefine Molecular Complexity Using Descriptors**:
   - Calculate molecular complexity using descriptors like the Bertz index.
   - Set thresholds based on these values to define "complex or bulky structures" in Rule 13.

5. **Enhance Carbon Counting Methods**:
   - Exclude carbons in side chains or cyclic structures when counting.
   - Focus on the main chain relevant to the rule's context.

6. **Expand Exclusion Lists in Rules**:
   - In Rule 11 and similar, include other strong coordinating groups such as carboxylates, phosphates, and imidazoles in the exclusion criteria.

7. **Generalize Functional Group Patterns**:
   - For the indole group in Rule 12, use a more general SMARTS pattern like `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c2` to capture various indole derivatives.

8. **Utilize RDKit's Functional Group Catalog**:
   - Leverage RDKit's built-in definitions to ensure consistent and accurate identification of functional groups across molecules.

9. **Improve Exception Handling and Logging**:
   - Implement comprehensive exception handling to capture and log errors in molecule processing.
   - Use logging messages to provide insights into issues that arise during rule application.

10. **Adjust Rules Based on SHAP Analysis**:
    - Modify or refine rules that contribute to incorrect predictions as indicated by SHAP values.
    - For example, if Rule 1 often leads to overprediction of high yield, refine its conditions to be more specific.

11. **Balance Rule Specificity and Generality**:
    - Avoid overly specific rules that apply to very few molecules (low support) or overly general rules that decrease confidence.
    - Aim for rules with sufficient support, high confidence, and lift.

12. **Include Additional Molecular Descriptors**:
    - Incorporate descriptors such as molecular weight, polar surface area, and electronic properties to enhance rule conditions.

**Possibility for Further Optimization**

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining SMARTS patterns, incorporating accurate chain length measurements, and adjusting rules based on SHAP analysis, the predictive performance can be improved while maintaining generalization.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (3 to 6 carbons) with additional *strong coordinating groups* such as *amino*, *carboxyl*, or *thiol groups* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Short-chain aliphatic acids with additional coordinating functional groups enhance metal-ligand interactions through effective chelation, improving catalyst activity and stability.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with *electron-withdrawing groups* capable of coordination (e.g., *amino*, *nitro*, *bromomethyl*) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen heterocycles serve as effective ligands, donating electron density to metal centers and stabilizing the catalyst through strong coordination.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *polyhydroxy carboxylic acids* result in **high yield** due to multiple coordination sites.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several chelation points, enhancing metal binding and improving catalyst efficiency through multidentate coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted with *aldehyde or ketone groups* result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions and interference with coordination.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde and ketone groups can undergo side reactions or compete with the carboxyl group for metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in **low yield** due to poor coordination ability.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions and diminishing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with non-coordinating aromatic side chains* (e.g., *phenylalanine*) result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms do not enhance metal binding, leading to less effective catalyst modification and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (more than six carbons) with *terminal amino or hydroxyl groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Longer aliphatic chains increase flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency and weakening metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with *electron-donating groups* (e.g., *methyl groups*) result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group and do not provide additional coordination sites, leading to weaker metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with *aromatic thiol groups* result in **low yield** due to catalyst poisoning.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with *ether linkages* and lacking strong coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weak ligands, and the flexibility introduced by ether linkages reduces effective coordination due to entropic factors, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with aromatic side chains* containing *coordinating heteroatoms* (e.g., the indole nitrogen in *tryptophan*) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in the side chain can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing ligand-metal interactions and improving catalyst activity through additional binding sites.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with *complex or bulky structures* that may interfere with coordination or cause steric hindrance result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky substituents and complex structures may hinder effective coordination with metal centers, reducing catalyst performance due to steric effects.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *hydroxyl groups* on the aromatic ring result in variable yield depending on *chain length* and *positioning* of the hydroxyl group.**

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The distance between the carboxyl group and the aromatic ring influences coordination efficiency; longer linkers may facilitate better interaction with the metal center, enhancing yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are *simple aliphatic carboxylic acids* without additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Simple aliphatic acids may provide optimal spacing and minimal steric hindrance, allowing effective coordination with the metal center and promoting catalytic activity.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Implement position-specific SMARTS patterns for aromatic substituents.** Enhance rules involving substituted aromatic carboxylic acids (e.g., Rule 2 and Rule 9) by using SMARTS patterns that specify substituent positions relative to the carboxyl group. For instance, in Rule 2, which targets para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups, use a SMARTS pattern like `c1cc(ccc1C(=O)[O-])[*]` where the `[*]` represents an electron-withdrawing group at the para-position. This ensures accurate matching of molecules with substituents at the desired position.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine SMARTS patterns to detect perfluorinated chains and specific functional groups.** For Rule 6, expand the SMARTS pattern to identify perfluorinated carboxylic acids of various chain lengths. Use patterns like `C(F)(F)F` for trifluoromethyl groups and `C(F)(F)-[C,F]*` for longer perfluorinated chains. Similarly, generalize patterns for other functional groups by including diverse representations to improve rule coverage.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate accurate chain length measurement in rules dependent on chain length.** Use RDKit's molecular graph analysis to count carbons in aliphatic chains. Implement a function that identifies the longest continuous chain of sp³-hybridized carbons (excluding rings and side chains) for rules like Rule 1 and Rule 8. This ensures precise classification based on chain length criteria specified in the rules.

- **Advice 4**: **Redefine molecular complexity using appropriate molecular descriptors.** For Rule 13, assess molecular complexity with descriptors like the Bertz complexity index accessible via RDKit (`Descriptors.BertzCT`). Set a threshold value (e.g., BertzCT > 500) to identify modifiers with complex or bulky structures. This quantitative approach improves the consistency and reliability of the rule.

- **Advice 5**: **Expand exclusion lists in rules involving coordination groups.** Update rules like Rule 11 to include all relevant strong coordinating groups. Modify the exclusion criteria to encompass functional groups such as phosphates (`P(=O)([O-])[O-]`), sulfonates (`S(=O)(=O)[O-]`), and imidazole rings (`c1cnc[nH]1`). This prevents misclassification of modifiers that may not fit the intended category due to unaccounted functional groups.

- **Advice 6**: **Generalize functional group definitions using RDKit's built-in functionalities.** Utilize RDKit's `Chem.Fragments` and `Chem.MolFromSmarts` to detect functional groups more broadly. For example, detect indole groups in Rule 12 by using the SMARTS pattern `c1[nH]c2c(c1)cccc2`, which captures various indole derivatives. This enhances the ability to identify target functional groups across different molecular structures.

- **Advice 7**: **Improve exception handling and logging during rule application.** Implement robust exception handling to catch errors in molecule parsing or rule matching. Use try-except blocks around critical code sections and log informative messages when exceptions occur. This facilitates debugging and ensures that errors do not go unnoticed during the application of the rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Adjust rules based on SHAP value analysis to improve model accuracy.** Analyze the SHAP values associated with each rule to identify those that negatively impact predictions. Refine such rules by tightening their conditions or adding additional parameters. For instance, if Rule 1 is too broad and leads to incorrect high-yield predictions, specify additional functional groups or structural features that must be present for the rule to apply.

- **Advice 9**: **Implement chain length and substituent position logic using molecular paths.** For rules like Rule 14, use RDKit's `Chem.GetShortestPath()` to calculate the number of bonds between key functional groups (e.g., between a carboxyl group and a hydroxyl-substituted aromatic ring). Incorporate this distance into the rule criteria to accurately capture the influence of chain length and substituent positioning on yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Balance rule specificity and generality using support, confidence, and lift metrics.** Evaluate each rule by calculating its support (how many molecules it applies to), confidence (prediction accuracy when the rule applies), and lift (improvement over random chance). Adjust rules that are too narrow (low support) or too broad (low confidence or lift). This ensures that the rules are both applicable to a significant portion of the data and make reliable predictions.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids* (with 4 to 5 carbons) containing an additional *amino group* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The presence of two carboxyl groups and an amino group provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions. This multidentate binding enhances the stability and activity of the catalyst by forming strong chelation complexes with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with *electron-withdrawing groups* capable of coordination (e.g., *amino*, *nitro*, *bromomethyl*) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and can participate in coordination with metal ions. The para-substitution ensures optimal positioning for interaction with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance through improved metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heteroaromatic carboxylic acids* with nitrogen atoms in the ring capable of coordination result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen heterocycles can donate lone pairs to metal centers, acting as effective ligands. The aromatic ring provides stability, while the nitrogen atom enhances coordination, resulting in a more active and stable catalyst.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with multiple *hydroxyl groups* (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups offer several coordination sites for metal binding. This multidentate interaction increases the stability of the metal complex and enhances catalytic activity by facilitating stronger and more numerous metal-ligand bonds.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with a *terminal thiol group* on a short chain (3 carbons) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The thiol group can form strong bonds with metal ions, and in short-chain acids, steric hindrance is minimized. This facilitates effective coordination without deactivating the catalyst, thus enhancing yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *simple aliphatic carboxylic acids* with a carbon chain length of up to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Simple aliphatic acids can effectively interact with metal centers without steric hindrance or interference from additional functional groups. The optimal chain length allows for sufficient interaction while maintaining the catalyst's activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with coordinating side chains* containing *heteroatoms* (e.g., indole nitrogen in tryptophan) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Side chains with heteroatoms can provide additional coordination sites. The indole ring's nitrogen atom can coordinate with metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through multidentate binding.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with *electron-donating groups* (e.g., *methyl*, *methoxy*, *hydroxyl*) result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group and do not offer additional coordination sites. This results in weaker metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *para-substituted thiol groups* result in **low yield** due to catalyst poisoning through strong metal-sulfur bonds.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic thiol groups can bind irreversibly to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst. The strong metal-sulfur interaction can block active sites and inhibit catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *aldehyde groups* (e.g., formyl groups) result in **low yield** due to side reactions and interference with coordination.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can undergo side reactions, such as condensation or reduction, interfering with the catalyst. They may also compete with the carboxyl group for metal coordination, leading to a less effective catalyst.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (more than 6 carbons) with *terminal amino or hydroxyl groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Longer aliphatic chains increase molecular flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of coordination between functional groups and the metal center. This leads to weaker metal-ligand interactions and decreased catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with non-coordinating aromatic side chains* (e.g., *phenylalanine*) result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms do not enhance metal binding. The absence of additional coordination sites means the modifier cannot effectively stabilize the metal center, resulting in lower catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are *carboxylic acids with long ethylene glycol chains* result in **low yield** due to weak coordination and entropic penalties.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are poor ligands, and the flexibility introduced by long ethylene glycol chains increases the entropic cost of binding. This results in weak metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density hindering coordination.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen atoms, weakening their ability to coordinate with metal ions. This leads to less effective catalyst modification and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with *bulky or sterically hindered functional groups* that impede effective coordination result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Bulky substituents can hinder the approach of functional groups to the metal center, reducing coordination efficiency. Steric hindrance can prevent optimal metal-ligand interactions, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify Rules Using SMILES-Detectable Features**

  Modify the existing rules to focus on structural features that can be directly identified from SMILES strings. For instance, specify the presence of specific functional groups, heteroatoms, or ring systems in a way that can be parsed computationally. This will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix from the SMILES representations.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Overlapping and Redundant Rules**

  Review the current rules for overlap and redundancy. Combine similar rules to reduce complexity. For example, rules involving *short-chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with amino groups* (Rule 1) and *amino acids with coordinating side chains containing heteroatoms* (Rule 7) can be merged into a broader rule about *amino acids or acids with amino groups that can coordinate with metals*.

- **Advice 3**: **Define Clear Numerical Thresholds**

  Replace vague descriptors like "short-chain" or "long-chain" with specific numerical values. For example, specify "carboxylic acids with carbon chain lengths of 4 to 6 carbons result in high yield," and "carbon chains longer than 6 carbons result in low yield." This clarity will help in quantitatively assessing features from SMILES strings.

- **Advice 4**: **Use SMARTS Patterns for Functional Group Identification**

  Incorporate SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification) patterns to precisely define the functional groups and substructures relevant to the rules. This will enable automated detection of key features within the SMILES strings and facilitate the creation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 5**: **Quantify Electronic Effects with Computable Descriptors**

  Utilize computable electronic descriptors such as Hammett sigma constants, partial charges, or electronegativity values. These can be calculated from the molecular structure and used to assess the influence of substituents on the reaction yield, providing a more quantitative approach to rules involving electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups.

- **Advice 6**: **Eliminate Subjective Terminology**

  Remove subjective terms like "bulky," "sterically hindered," or "strong" and replace them with quantifiable parameters. For example, use Sterimol parameters, molecular volume, or the Van der Waals surface area to represent steric effects numerically.

- **Advice 7**: **Create a Hierarchical Rule Application Structure**

  Establish a decision tree or flowchart that applies the rules in a specific order based on the most significant features. This hierarchy will resolve conflicts where multiple rules might apply to a single compound and ensure consistent application across the dataset.

- **Advice 8**: **Include Negative Examples in Rule Formation**

  Ensure that the rules account for both positive (high yield) and negative (low yield) examples. Incorporate modifiers known to result in low yield into the rules with clear structural reasons, enhancing the predictive capability of the rules for new compounds.

- **Advice 9**: **Integrate Computed Molecular Descriptors**

  Incorporate molecular descriptors that can be calculated directly from SMILES strings, such as:

  - **Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD) and Acceptors (HBA)**
  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**
  - **LogP (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient)**
  - **Number of Rotatable Bonds**

  Including these descriptors will allow for quantitative assessment and comparison of molecular properties related to the reaction yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Use Machine Learning to Refine and Generate Rules**

  Apply machine learning algorithms to the dataset to identify patterns and correlations between molecular features and reaction yields. Techniques such as decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines can highlight the most significant features influencing yield, leading to the refinement of existing rules or the creation of new, more accurate ones.

- **Advice 11**: **Clarify Coordination Chemistry Considerations**

  Provide explicit details on how specific functional groups interact with the metal center. For instance, specify that nitrogen atoms in heterocycles coordinate via lone pairs, and quantify the coordination number where possible. This will make the rules more precise and easier to apply computationally.

- **Advice 12**: **Update Rules with Exceptions and Outliers**

  Re-examine the dataset for compounds that do not fit the current rules and adjust the rules to accommodate these exceptions. For example, if certain long-chain amino acids unexpectedly result in high yield, analyze the reasons and modify the rules accordingly.

- **Advice 13**: **Standardize Nomenclature and Definitions**

  Ensure that all chemical terms and definitions used in the rules are standardized. Provide clear definitions for terms like "electron-withdrawing group," "heteroaromatic," or "polyhydroxy acid" to avoid ambiguity during rule application.

- **Advice 14**: **Emphasize Functional Group Priority**

  When multiple functional groups are present, establish guidelines on which groups take priority in influencing the yield. For example, specify that coordinating groups like amino or thiol groups have a more significant impact than alkyl substituents.

- **Advice 15**: **Facilitate Computational Implementation**

  Design the rules with computational implementation in mind. Each rule should be translatable into an algorithm or a set of computational queries that can systematically analyze new compounds and predict their expected yield category.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic dicarboxylic acids* with an additional *amino group* on the alpha carbon result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an amino group allows for tridentate coordination with metal centers. This multidentate binding enhances the stability and activity of the catalyst by forming strong complexes with the metal ion, facilitating efficient electron transfer during the reaction.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with an *amino* or *nitro* group result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Amino and nitro groups can coordinate with metal centers or influence the electronic properties of the aromatic ring. The para-substitution positions these groups optimally for interaction, enhancing metal-ligand coordination, and increasing the acidity of the carboxyl group, which strengthens binding to the metal ion.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heterocyclic carboxylic acids* containing *nitrogen atoms* in the ring capable of coordination result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as electron donors, coordinating with metal centers. This coordination enhances the electron density at the metal ion, improving catalytic activity. The rigidity of the heterocycle also contributes to the stability of the metal-ligand complex.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with multiple *hydroxyl groups* (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding. This multidentate interaction increases the strength and stability of the metal complex, enhancing catalytic efficiency by facilitating effective electron transfer processes.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* with a *thiol group* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Thiol groups have a high affinity for metal ions, forming strong metal-sulfur bonds. In short-chain acids, the minimal steric hindrance allows the thiol and carboxyl groups to coordinate simultaneously with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *simple aliphatic carboxylic acids* with chain lengths up to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: These acids can effectively coordinate with metal centers through their carboxyl group without interference from other functional groups. The optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, maintaining catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted with *aldehyde groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can undergo side reactions, such as condensation or oxidation, which may deactivate the catalyst. They can also interfere with metal coordination by competing with the carboxyl group, reducing effective metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *para-substituted methyl or methoxy groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups like methyl and methoxy decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. They do not provide additional coordination sites, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (more than 6 carbons) with *terminal amino or hydroxyl groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Long aliphatic chains increase flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination of functional groups to the metal center. This results in weaker metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorine's strong electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate group, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal ions. The resultant weak metal-ligand interactions lead to poor catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *thiol groups* on the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to catalyst poisoning.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic thiol groups can form very strong bonds with metal centers, potentially leading to irreversible binding that deactivates the catalyst by blocking active sites needed for the reaction.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with long *polyether chains* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The ether oxygen atoms have lone pairs but are poor ligands due to the electron-withdrawing effect of adjacent oxygen atoms. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains hinder effective coordination with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with *non-coordinating side chains*, such as a *phenyl group*, result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms do not contribute to metal binding. The phenyl group is hydrophobic and does not facilitate additional interactions with the metal center, resulting in weaker overall coordination.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with side chains containing *thioether groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Thioether sulfur atoms are less effective at coordinating with metal ions compared to thiol sulfur. Additionally, the bulkiness of the thioether side chain can introduce steric hindrance, reducing effective metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are *dicarboxylic acids* with *keto groups* in the chain result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ketone groups can participate in keto-enol tautomerism and may interfere with metal coordination by engaging in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or forming enolates. This reduces the availability of coordination sites for the metal ion.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic dicarboxylic acids* with an additional *amino group* on the alpha carbon result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an amino group allows for tridentate coordination with metal centers. This multidentate binding enhances the stability and activity of the catalyst by forming strong complexes with the metal ion, facilitating efficient electron transfer during the reaction.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with an *amino* or *nitro* group result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Amino and nitro groups can coordinate with metal centers or influence the electronic properties of the aromatic ring. The para-substitution positions these groups optimally for interaction, enhancing metal-ligand coordination, and increasing the acidity of the carboxyl group, which strengthens binding to the metal ion.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heterocyclic carboxylic acids* containing *nitrogen atoms* in the ring capable of coordination result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as electron donors, coordinating with metal centers. This coordination enhances the electron density at the metal ion, improving catalytic activity. The rigidity of the heterocycle also contributes to the stability of the metal-ligand complex.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with multiple *hydroxyl groups* (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding. This multidentate interaction increases the strength and stability of the metal complex, enhancing catalytic efficiency by facilitating effective electron transfer processes.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* with a *thiol group* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Thiol groups have a high affinity for metal ions, forming strong metal-sulfur bonds. In short-chain acids, the minimal steric hindrance allows the thiol and carboxyl groups to coordinate simultaneously with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *simple aliphatic carboxylic acids* with chain lengths up to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: These acids can effectively coordinate with metal centers through their carboxyl group without interference from other functional groups. The optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, maintaining catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted with *aldehyde groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can undergo side reactions, such as condensation or oxidation, which may deactivate the catalyst. They can also interfere with metal coordination by competing with the carboxyl group, reducing effective metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *para-substituted methyl or methoxy groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups like methyl and methoxy decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. They do not provide additional coordination sites, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (more than 6 carbons) with *terminal amino or hydroxyl groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Long aliphatic chains increase flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination of functional groups to the metal center. This results in weaker metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorine's strong electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate group, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal ions. The resultant weak metal-ligand interactions lead to poor catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *thiol groups* on the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to catalyst poisoning.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic thiol groups can form very strong bonds with metal centers, potentially leading to irreversible binding that deactivates the catalyst by blocking active sites needed for the reaction.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with long *polyether chains* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The ether oxygen atoms have lone pairs but are poor ligands due to the electron-withdrawing effect of adjacent oxygen atoms. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains hinder effective coordination with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with *non-coordinating side chains*, such as a *phenyl group*, result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms do not contribute to metal binding. The phenyl group is hydrophobic and does not facilitate additional interactions with the metal center, resulting in weaker overall coordination.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with side chains containing *thioether groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Thioether sulfur atoms are less effective at coordinating with metal ions compared to thiol sulfur. Additionally, the bulkiness of the thioether side chain can introduce steric hindrance, reducing effective metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are *dicarboxylic acids* with *keto groups* in the chain result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ketone groups can participate in keto-enol tautomerism and may interfere with metal coordination by engaging in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or forming enolates. This reduces the availability of coordination sites for the metal ion.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules describe the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their influence on the yield of the reaction. Each rule combines multiple functional group features and considers underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, and steric factors.

By following these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural characteristics. The rules prioritize broad coverage of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity, providing clear guidance for selecting or designing modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise Rule 1 SMARTS patterns to accurately identify aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with an amino group on the alpha carbon.**
  
  The current SMARTS patterns for `dicarboxylic_acid` (`'[#6][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) and `amino_on_alpha` (`'[NX3H2][CX4H]'`) do not ensure both carboxylic acid groups are present and correctly positioned relative to the amino group. This leads to incorrect matches, such as compounds that are not dicarboxylic acids or do not have the amino group on the alpha carbon.

  **Improvement**: Use a SMARTS pattern that specifies two carboxylic acid groups attached to a carbon chain with an amino group on the alpha carbon. For example:

  ```python
  dicarboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0][CX2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0]'
  amino_on_alpha = '[NX3H2][CX4H][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0]'
  ```

  Combine them to ensure the amino group is on the alpha carbon of a dicarboxylic acid:

  ```python
  rule1_pattern = '[NX3H2][CX4H][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0][CX2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0]'
  patterns['rule1'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts(rule1_pattern)
  ```

  Update Rule 1 to use the new combined pattern:

  ```python
  {
      'number': 1,
      'description': 'Modifiers that are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with an additional amino group on the alpha carbon result in high yield.',
      'patterns': ['rule1'],
      'prediction': 1
  }
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct Rule 2 SMARTS patterns to match para-substituted amino or nitro groups on aromatic carboxylic acids.**

  The current patterns for `para_amino_substituted_ring` and `para_nitro_substituted_ring` are oversimplified and may not match valid compounds or may miss valid matches due to rigid definitions.

  **Improvement**: Use more general SMARTS patterns that accurately capture para-substitution on aromatic rings with carboxylic acid groups. For example:

  ```python
  para_amino_substituted_ring = 'c1ccc(N)c(c1)C(=O)O'
  para_nitro_substituted_ring = 'c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(c1)C(=O)O'
  ```

  Alternatively, use recursive SMARTS to specify para-substitution relative to the carboxylic acid:

  ```python
  para_substituted_aromatic_acid = '[cH]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1C(=O)O'
  para_amino_group = '[cH]1[cH][cH][cH][NH2][cH]1C(=O)O'
  para_nitro_group = '[cH]1[cH][cH][cH][N+](=O)[O-][cH]1C(=O)O'
  ```

  Update the patterns accordingly and ensure Rule 2 correctly applies to compounds with para-substituted amino or nitro groups on aromatic carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Expand Rule 3 SMARTS pattern to include various heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing coordinating nitrogen atoms.**

  The current `heterocyclic_nitrogen_ring` pattern (`'[n][c][c][c][c][C](=O)[O]'`) is too specific and may miss valid compounds.

  **Improvement**: Use a more general pattern that captures heterocycles with nitrogen and a carboxylic acid group:

  ```python
  heterocyclic_nitrogen_ring = '[n]:[c]:[c]:[c]:[c]:[c][C](=O)O'
  ```

  Or, to generalize further:

  ```python
  heterocyclic_carboxylic_acid = '[#6]c1ncccc1C(=O)O'
  patterns['heterocyclic_nitrogen_ring'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts(heterocyclic_carboxylic_acid)
  ```

  This ensures that other heterocycles with coordinating nitrogen atoms are matched.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Refine Rule 4 SMARTS pattern for polyhydroxy acids to correctly identify multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains with a carboxylic acid.**

  The current `polyhydroxy_acid` pattern (`'[CX4;!$(C([OX2H])[OX2H])][OX2H]'`) may not accurately identify polyhydroxy acids.

  **Improvement**: Use a pattern that looks for aliphatic chains with at least two hydroxyl groups and a terminal carboxylic acid group:

  ```python
  polyhydroxy_acid = '[CX4H2][OX2H][CX4H][OX2H][CX4H][OX2H][CX4][C](=O)O'
  ```

  Alternatively, check for at least two hydroxyl groups:

  ```python
  polyhydroxy_acid = '[CX4][CX4][C](=O)O'
  hydroxyl_group = '[OX2H]'
  ```

  Then, in the code, verify that at least two hydroxyl groups are present in the molecule.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Ensure Rule 6 excludes modifiers with additional functional groups correctly.**

  The code for Rule 6 includes `exclude_patterns`: `['long_aliphatic_chain', 'primary_amino', 'thiol_group', 'polyhydroxy_acid']`, but it does not exclude other functional groups.

  **Improvement**: Modify the exclude patterns to include any additional functional groups beyond the carboxylic acid. You can use a general pattern to exclude molecules containing any heteroatoms (O, N, S) apart from the carboxylic acid group.

  ```python
  functional_groups = '[#6][!#6;!H]'
  patterns['functional_groups'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts(functional_groups)
  ```

  Update Rule 6 to include `'functional_groups'` in `exclude_patterns` to exclude molecules with any other functional groups.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Adjust Rule 9 to correctly identify long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups.**

  The `long_aliphatic_chain` pattern is defined as `'[CH2]' * 6`, but this doesn't ensure that the chain is connected, nor does it properly identify terminal functional groups.

  **Improvement**: Use a SMARTS pattern that specifies a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups:

  ```python
  long_chain = '[CH2]' * 6
  terminal_amino = '[NX3H2]'
  terminal_hydroxyl = '[OX2H]'
  long_chain_terminal_functional_group = f'{long_chain}[CX4H2][{terminal_amino},{terminal_hydroxyl}]'
  patterns['long_chain_terminal_functional_group'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts(long_chain_terminal_functional_group)
  ```

  Update Rule 9 to use this combined pattern.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Correct inconsistencies in the application of rules to the SMILES list by ensuring that the code checks all necessary patterns for each rule.**

  In the current code, some rules may incorrectly match compounds because not all required conditions are checked, or due to overlap in SMARTS patterns.

  **Improvement**: For each rule, revisit the conditions and ensure all necessary patterns are included, and mutually exclusive patterns are properly used. Use `all()` and `any()` functions to combine pattern matches appropriately, and test each rule thoroughly against the SMILES list.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Implement unit tests or validation steps to verify that each rule correctly identifies the intended compounds.**

  Testing is crucial to ensure that the SMARTS patterns and rules are correctly implemented.

  **Improvement**: Create a set of test cases with known compounds that should match or not match each rule. Use these test cases to validate the patterns and refine them as necessary.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

After reviewing the current rule metrics and comparing them with the reference metrics from previous iterations, we observe the following:

### **1. Comparison of Metrics**

#### **Support**

- **Previous Train Support**: 
  - Mean values: 0.1667, 0.1845
- **Current Train Support**: 
  - 0.0305

#### **Confidence**

- **Previous Train Confidence**: 
  - Mean values: 0.6352, 0.5396
- **Current Train Confidence**: 
  - 0.5407

#### **Lift**

- **Previous Train Lift**: 
  - Mean values: 1.2048, 1.0559
- **Current Train Lift**: 
  - 1.0918

#### **Leverage**

- **Previous Train Leverage**: 
  - 0.0289, -0.0041
- **Current Train Leverage**: 
  - 0.00076

### **2. Interpretation of Metrics**

#### **Support**

- The **current train support** of **0.0305** is significantly lower than the **previous mean supports** of **0.1667** and **0.1845**.
- **Interpretation**: The current rules cover approximately **3.05%** of the training data, which indicates that they are applicable to a smaller subset of the dataset compared to previous rules.

#### **Confidence**

- The **current train confidence** of **0.5407** is similar to the **previous mean confidence** of **0.5396**, and slightly lower than the highest previous confidence of **0.6352**.
- **Interpretation**: When the current rules apply, they predict the outcome correctly about **54.07%** of the time, which is moderate but not highly predictive.

#### **Lift**

- The **current train lift** of **1.0918** is higher than the previous lower mean lift of **1.0559** but lower than the higher mean lift of **1.2048**.
- **Interpretation**: The lift value above **1** indicates that the rules are better than random chance at predicting the outcome. However, the current lift improvement is modest.

#### **Leverage**

- The **current train leverage** of **0.00076** is positive but very small compared to the previous positive leverage of **0.0289**.
- **Interpretation**: The small leverage suggests that the rule has minimal added value over random chance in increasing the probability of the outcome.

### **3. Overall Performance Assessment**

- **Support Decline**: The significant drop in support indicates that the current rules are too specific or narrow, covering a much smaller portion of the dataset. This limits the practical applicability of the rules.
- **Confidence Stability**: The confidence level remains relatively stable compared to previous iterations. While maintaining confidence is positive, it has not improved despite the decrease in support.
- **Lift Modest Increase**: The lift has slightly increased compared to the lower previous mean but is still below the highest previous value. This suggests a marginal improvement in the rule's ability to predict the outcome over the baseline probability.
- **Leverage Insignificance**: The low leverage value indicates that the rules do not substantially increase the predictive power beyond what is expected by chance.

### **4. Determination of Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency**

- **Local Minimum Reached**: Given that the metrics have not shown significant improvement over previous iterations, especially considering the decreased support, it suggests that we may have reached a local minimum in optimization. The current rules are not contributing substantially to better performance.
- **Iteration Sufficiency**: The diminishing returns in metric improvements imply that additional iterations using the current approach may not yield better results. It may be time to re-evaluate the strategy for rule generation.

### **5. Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Increase Rule Generality to Boost Support**

   - **Problem**: Current rules are too specific, resulting in low support.
   - **Solution**: 
     - **Generalize the Rules**: Broaden the criteria of the rules to cover more instances without sacrificing too much confidence and lift.
     - **Example**: Instead of specifying modifiers with *thiol groups on short-chain aliphatic acids*, consider *modifiers with highly nucleophilic functional groups*.

2. **Refine Rule Conditions for Higher Confidence and Lift**

   - **Problem**: Confidence and lift are moderate but not high.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Identify Strong Predictors**: Focus on functional groups or structural features that have a stronger correlation with high yield.
     - **Combine Features**: Use combinations of features that together contribute to higher confidence and lift.

3. **Balance Specificity and Coverage**

   - **Problem**: High specificity decreases support; too much generality can decrease confidence and lift.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Segment the Data**: Analyze subsets of the data to find patterns that can be generalized across larger portions without losing predictive power.
     - **Rule Hierarchies**: Develop a hierarchical rule set where general rules are supplemented with more specific sub-rules.

4. **Incorporate Additional Data Features**

   - **Problem**: Current rules may not account for all influential factors.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Consider Physicochemical Properties**: Include properties such as pKa, logP, or electronic parameters that may influence catalytic activity.
     - **Machine Learning Techniques**: Use statistical models or machine learning to identify non-obvious patterns in the data.

5. **Validate Rules Against Test Data**

   - **Problem**: Current metrics are based on training data; performance on unseen data is crucial.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Evaluate Test Metrics**: Analyze how the rules perform on test data, focusing on confidence, lift, and support.
     - **Adjust Rules Accordingly**: If performance on test data is poor, revisit the rules for potential overfitting.

6. **Iterative Refinement with Domain Expertise**

   - **Problem**: Rules may not fully capture the underlying chemical phenomena.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Expert Consultation**: Collaborate with chemists to ensure that the rules make sense chemically and are not just statistical artifacts.
     - **Incorporate Mechanistic Insights**: Use knowledge of reaction mechanisms to inform rule adjustments.

7. **Alternative Metrics for Evaluation**

   - **Problem**: Reliance on current metrics may not capture all aspects of rule performance.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Use Additional Metrics**: Consider metrics like **Gini index**, **ROC curves**, or **F1 score** for a more comprehensive evaluation.
     - **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balance multiple metrics to find optimal rule sets.

### **Conclusion**

The current rules exhibit moderate confidence and lift but suffer from low support, limiting their practical utility. The lack of significant improvement over previous iterations suggests that a local minimum has been reached. To enhance the performance of the rules, it is recommended to generalize the conditions to increase support while carefully monitoring the impact on confidence and lift.

By adopting a more holistic approach that balances specificity and coverage, and by incorporating additional data features and domain expertise, the rules can be improved to provide more reliable and applicable predictions for the catalytic problem at hand.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the performance of the current rules shows a notable decrease in accuracy compared to previous iterations. Here's a summary of the validation accuracies:

- **Previous Reference Accuracies**:
  - Validation Accuracies: Mostly around **76%**
  - Test Accuracies: **75%** and **62.5%**

- **Current Iteration Accuracies**:
  - Validation Accuracies: **51.43%**, **51.43%**, **57.14%**, **74.29%**, **51.43%**

This decline from approximately **76%** to the range of **51%–74%** indicates that the current set of rules is less effective in capturing the underlying patterns needed for accurate predictions.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Underfitting**: The consistently lower validation accuracies suggest that the model may be **underfitting**. The rules might be too simplistic or not adequately capturing the complexity of the data, leading to poor performance on both training and validation sets.
- **Overfitting**: If training accuracies are high while validation accuracies are low, it would indicate **overfitting**. However, the data provided doesn't specify training accuracies, so we infer underfitting based on available validation metrics.

**Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

To identify problematic rules, we examine molecules where the predicted loading differs from the experimental value and analyze the associated SHAP values.

1. **Overestimated Loadings** (Predicted: High; Experimental: Low)
   - **Key Observation**: Rules with **high positive SHAP values** contribute most to the incorrect high predictions.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Molecule**: `C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`
       - **Problematic Rule**: **Rule 1** with SHAP value **0.3016**
     - **Molecule**: `C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F`
       - **Problematic Rule**: **Rule 1** with SHAP value **0.1701**
     - **Molecule**: `COCCOCCOCC(=O)O`
       - **Problematic Rule**: **Rule 1** with SHAP value **0.2478**
   
   - **Interpretation**: **Rule 1** is consistently contributing to overestimations, suggesting it may be too broadly defined or not sufficiently specific.

2. **Underestimated Loadings** (Predicted: Low; Experimental: High)
   - **Key Observation**: Rules with **high negative SHAP values** are causing the model to incorrectly predict low loading.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Molecule**: `C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`
       - **Problematic Rule**: **Rule 2** with SHAP value **-0.0545**
     - **Molecule**: `C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O`
       - **Problematic Rule**: **Rule 2** with SHAP value **0.0846**
     - **Molecule**: `C1=CC2=C(C=C1C(=O)O)C(=O)OC2=O`
       - **Problematic Rule**: **Rule 2** with SHAP value **0.0960**

   - **Interpretation**: **Rule 2** shows conflicting contributions—positive in some cases and negative in others—indicating it may need refinement to align better with experimental outcomes.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

- The decrease in accuracy suggests that the current rules are **not sufficiently capturing** the features necessary for accurate predictions.
- The model's fluctuations in accuracy across iterations indicate **instability** and potential issues with rule generalization.
- The brief increase to **74.29%** in one iteration suggests that certain adjustments may lead to improvements, but consistency is lacking.

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

1. **Refine Problematic Rules**:

   - **Rule 1**: Associated with overestimations.
     - **Issue**: Rule 1 governs modifiers that are *aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with an amino group on the alpha carbon*, resulting in high yield.
     - **Suggested Improvement**:
       - **Increase Specificity**: Incorporate additional structural constraints to differentiate between modifiers that truly result in high yield and those that do not.
       - **Exclude Certain Structures**: Identify and exclude compounds where the amino group does not significantly contribute to metal coordination as expected.

   - **Rule 2**: Associated with both underestimations and overestimations.
     - **Issue**: Rule 2 covers *aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para-position with amino or nitro groups*.
     - **Suggested Improvement**:
       - **Clarify Substituent Effects**: Consider the electronic effects of substituents more precisely, possibly distinguishing between strongly activating and moderately activating groups.
       - **Adjust Position Specificity**: Re-evaluate whether only para-substitution is beneficial or if other positions contribute positively.

2. **Modify or Remove Ineffective Rules**:

   - **Rule 3**: Shows minimal SHAP impact but may not contribute significantly.
     - **Action**: Reassess the necessity of Rule 3. If it's not differentiating effectively, consider redefining or removing it.

3. **Address Overfitting/Underfitting**:

   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: Reduce complexity in rules that may be overfitting by being too narrowly defined.
   - **Enhance Underfitting Rules**: Provide additional detail or sub-rules to capture more nuances in cases where the rules are too broad.

4. **Integrate Additional Features**:

   - **Consider Steric Factors**: Introduce rules that account for steric hindrance, as bulky groups may impede coordination despite favorable functional groups.
   - **Electronegativity and Electronic Effects**: Incorporate electronic parameters to better predict how substituents influence coordination ability.

5. **Use SHAP Insights for Rule Refinement**:

   - **Identify Consistent Patterns**: Use SHAP analysis to find patterns where certain functional groups or structural features consistently lead to mispredictions.
   - **Iteratively Test Adjustments**: Make incremental changes to the rules and evaluate their impact on model performance to avoid large swings in accuracy.

6. **Enhance Generalization**:

   - **Broaden the Dataset**: If possible, include more diverse examples to help the model generalize better.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Utilize cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules perform well across different subsets of data.

7. **Collaboration and Expert Input**:

   - **Chemical Expertise**: Consult with chemists to validate the scientific rationale behind each rule and ensure they align with chemical principles.
   - **Interdisciplinary Review**: Work with data scientists to analyze statistical significance and with domain experts to interpret results.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules requires refinement to improve predictive accuracy. By focusing on the rules that contribute most to misclassifications, particularly **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**, and incorporating insights from the SHAP analysis, we can adjust the rules to better align with experimental observations. Iterative testing and validation will be essential to developing a robust set of rules that generalizes well across the dataset.

**Next Steps**

- **Revise Problematic Rules**: Implement the suggested changes to **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**.
- **Re-evaluate Performance**: Run the model with the updated rules and compare the new performance metrics to both current and previous results.
- **Continuous Refinement**: Repeat the analysis using SHAP values to identify any new patterns of misclassification and adjust accordingly.
- **Document Changes**: Keep detailed records of all changes made to rules and their impact on performance for future reference and collaboration.

By systematically refining the rules and leveraging both chemical insights and statistical analysis, we can enhance the model's predictive capability and contribute valuable findings to the catalytic research program.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

**1. Summary of Discussions and Rule Performance**

The current set of rules aims to predict the yield of a radical-mediated δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on the structure of molecular modifiers. The performance metrics and analyses indicate several issues with the current rules:

- **Low Support**: The current rules apply to only **3.05%** of the training data, a significant drop from previous supports of approximately **16-18%**. This low support limits the practical applicability of the rules.

- **Moderate Confidence and Lift**: The confidence level remains moderate at **54.07%**, similar to previous iterations. However, the lift value of **1.0918** indicates only a modest improvement over random chance.

- **Validation Accuracy**: Validation accuracies have decreased from around **76%** in previous iterations to between **51% and 74%**. This suggests that the current rules are not capturing the underlying patterns effectively.

- **SHAP Analysis Findings**:
  - **Rule 1**: Associated with overestimations of high yield for modifiers that experimentally result in low yield.
  - **Rule 2**: Shows conflicting contributions, indicating inconsistencies in predicting the outcome.

- **Conclusion from Analysis**: The current rules may be underfitting the data, failing to capture important structural features that influence the reaction yield. The significant drop in support and inconsistent accuracies suggest that there is room for optimization.

**2. Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

To improve the predictive performance of the rules, the following suggestions can be implemented:

**A. Refine SMARTS Patterns for Accurate Matching**

- **Rule 1 (Aliphatic Dicarboxylic Acids with Amino Group on Alpha Carbon)**:
  - **Issue**: Current patterns do not ensure correct positioning of the amino group relative to both carboxyl groups.
  - **Improvement**:
    - Use a more specific SMARTS pattern that captures both carboxylic acid groups and an amino group on the alpha carbon.
    - **Updated Pattern**:
      ```python
      patterns['rule1'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0]')
      ```
    - **Rationale**: Ensures that only compounds with the correct arrangement are matched, improving specificity and support.

- **Rule 2 (Para-Substituted Amino or Nitro Groups on Aromatic Carboxylic Acids)**:
  - **Issue**: Current patterns may miss valid compounds due to oversimplification.
  - **Improvement**:
    - Use recursive SMARTS or more general patterns to accurately capture para-substitution.
    - **Updated Patterns**:
      ```python
      patterns['para_amino_acid'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O')
      patterns['para_substituent'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(N|[N+](=O)[O-])cc1')
      ```
    - **Rationale**: Ensures that all relevant compounds with para-substituted amino or nitro groups are included.

- **Rule 3 (Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids with Coordinating Nitrogen Atoms)**:
  - **Issue**: The pattern is too specific, potentially missing valid heterocycles.
  - **Improvement**:
    - Expand the pattern to include various heterocycles with nitrogen atoms capable of coordination.
    - **Updated Pattern**:
      ```python
      patterns['heterocyclic_nitrogen_acid'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[nH]1cccc1C(=O)O')
      ```
    - **Rationale**: Broadens the rule to capture more compounds that fit the criteria.

**B. Exclude Confounding Functional Groups in Rules**

- **Rule 6 (Simple Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids)**:
  - **Issue**: May include compounds with additional functional groups that affect the yield.
  - **Improvement**:
    - Add patterns to exclude molecules with any functional groups beyond the carboxylic acid.
    - **Exclude Pattern**:
      ```python
      patterns['additional_functional_groups'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[!#6;!H]')
      ```
    - **Rationale**: Enhances the rule's specificity by ensuring only simple aliphatic carboxylic acids are considered.

**C. Adjust Rules for Better Balance Between Specificity and Coverage**

- **Increase Rule Generality**:
  - Broaden rules where possible without sacrificing accuracy to cover more of the dataset.
  - **Example**: Modify Rule 9 to include long-chain acids with terminal functional groups only if they significantly impact yield.

- **Add Rule Hierarchies**:
  - Create sub-rules to handle exceptions or special cases.
  - **Example**: For Rule 2, have sub-rules that account for different electronic effects of substituents.

**D. Incorporate Additional Structural and Physicochemical Features**

- **Include Electron Donating/Withdrawing Effects**:
  - Assess the impact of substituents on the aromatic ring or aliphatic chain.
  - **Action**: Incorporate parameters that account for electronic effects, such as Hammett sigma constants.

- **Consider Steric Factors**:
  - Include steric hindrance parameters to account for bulky groups that may impede coordination.
  - **Action**: Use molecular descriptors related to molecular size and shape.

**E. Validate Rules with Unit Tests and Iterative Refinement**

- **Implement Unit Tests**:
  - Create a set of test cases with known outcomes to validate each rule.
  - **Action**: Ensure that the rules correctly identify intended compounds and exclude incorrect ones.

- **Iterative Testing and Refinement**:
  - Continuously evaluate the performance of the rules after each modification.
  - **Action**: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the rules on different subsets of data.

**F. Collaborate with Domain Experts**

- **Consult Chemists and Data Scientists**:
  - Validate the chemical rationale behind each rule.
  - **Action**: Adjust rules based on expert feedback to align with known chemical behavior.

**3. Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is a strong possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Underfitting Indication**: The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the model is underfitting, meaning it is too simplistic and not capturing all relevant patterns.

- **Room for Improvement**: By refining the SMARTS patterns and incorporating additional features, the rules can become more accurate and cover a larger portion of the data.

- **Avoiding Overfitting**: By validating changes on both training and test datasets and ensuring that rules are grounded in chemical reasoning, overfitting can be minimized.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic dicarboxylic acids* with an additional *amino group* on the alpha carbon result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an amino group allows for tridentate coordination with metal centers. This multidentate binding enhances the stability and activity of the catalyst by forming strong complexes with the metal ion, facilitating efficient electron transfer during the reaction.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted at the *para-position* with an *amino* or *nitro* group result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Amino and nitro groups can coordinate with metal centers or influence the electronic properties of the aromatic ring. The para-substitution positions these groups optimally for interaction, enhancing metal-ligand coordination, and increasing the acidity of the carboxyl group, which strengthens binding to the metal ion.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heterocyclic carboxylic acids* containing *nitrogen atoms* in the ring capable of coordination result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as electron donors, coordinating with metal centers. This coordination enhances the electron density at the metal ion, improving catalytic activity. The rigidity of the heterocycle also contributes to the stability of the metal-ligand complex.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with multiple *hydroxyl groups* (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding. This multidentate interaction increases the strength and stability of the metal complex, enhancing catalytic efficiency by facilitating effective electron transfer processes.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* with a *thiol group* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Thiol groups have a high affinity for metal ions, forming strong metal-sulfur bonds. In short-chain acids, the minimal steric hindrance allows the thiol and carboxyl groups to coordinate simultaneously with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *simple aliphatic carboxylic acids* with chain lengths up to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: These acids can effectively coordinate with metal centers through their carboxyl group without interference from other functional groups. The optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, maintaining catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted with *aldehyde groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can undergo side reactions, such as condensation or oxidation, which may deactivate the catalyst. They can also interfere with metal coordination by competing with the carboxyl group, reducing effective metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *para-substituted methyl or methoxy groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups like methyl and methoxy decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. They do not provide additional coordination sites, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (more than 6 carbons) with *terminal amino or hydroxyl groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Long aliphatic chains increase flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination of functional groups to the metal center. This results in weaker metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorine's strong electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate group, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal ions. The resultant weak metal-ligand interactions lead to poor catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *thiol groups* on the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to catalyst poisoning.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic thiol groups can form very strong bonds with metal centers, potentially leading to irreversible binding that deactivates the catalyst by blocking active sites needed for the reaction.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with long *polyether chains* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The ether oxygen atoms have lone pairs but are poor ligands due to the electron-withdrawing effect of adjacent oxygen atoms. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains hinder effective coordination with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with *non-coordinating side chains*, such as a *phenyl group*, result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms do not contribute to metal binding. The phenyl group is hydrophobic and does not facilitate additional interactions with the metal center, resulting in weaker overall coordination.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with side chains containing *thioether groups* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Thioether sulfur atoms are less effective at coordinating with metal ions compared to thiol sulfur. Additionally, the bulkiness of the thioether side chain can introduce steric hindrance, reducing effective metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are *dicarboxylic acids* with *keto groups* in the chain result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ketone groups can participate in keto-enol tautomerism and may interfere with metal coordination by engaging in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or forming enolates. This reduces the availability of coordination sites for the metal ion.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 to accurately capture aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with an amino group on the alpha carbon.** Use a more specific pattern that ensures the amino group is correctly positioned relative to both carboxyl groups. Update the pattern to:

  ```python
  patterns['rule1'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0]')
  ```

  This pattern ensures that only compounds with the correct functional group arrangement are matched, improving the rule's specificity and support.

- **Advice 2**: **Expand Rule 2 to include all para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with amino or nitro groups.** Utilize more general or recursive SMARTS patterns to accurately capture para-substitution. For example:

  ```python
  patterns['para_amino_nitro_acid'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1[NH2,N+](=O)[O-])C(=O)O')
  ```

  This pattern includes all aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino or nitro groups, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

- **Advice 3**: **Broaden Rule 3 by expanding the SMARTS pattern to include various heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms capable of coordination.** Use a less specific pattern to capture more heterocycles:

  ```python
  patterns['heterocyclic_nitrogen_acid'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[nX2,nX3]1[n,c]ccc1C(=O)O')
  ```

  This pattern includes heterocycles like pyridine, pyrazole, and others with coordinating nitrogen atoms, enhancing the rule's applicability.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rule 6 to exclude modifiers with additional functional groups beyond the carboxylic acid.** Add an exclusion pattern to ensure only simple aliphatic carboxylic acids are matched:

  ```python
  patterns['rule6'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('C[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]C(=O)O')
  patterns['exclude_functional_groups'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[!#6;!H]')
  ```

  This improves specificity by excluding compounds with other functional groups or heteroatoms.

- **Advice 5**: **Adjust Rule 9 to balance specificity and coverage by reassessing the impact of terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids.** Consider whether some modifiers with such groups might actually result in high yield and revise the rule accordingly. Modify the pattern to:

  ```python
  patterns['rule9'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('CCCCCCC[CH2,CH](N,OH)C(=O)O')
  ```

  This ensures only modifiers where the terminal group negatively impacts yield are classified as low yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects into the rules by considering the influence of substituents on aromatic rings.** For example, update Rule 2 to differentiate between strong and weak donating/withdrawing groups:

  ```python
  patterns['strong_withdrawing'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1)[N+](=O)[O-]')
  patterns['strong_donating'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1)O')
  ```

  Including these patterns helps account for electronic effects on metal coordination and reaction yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Consider steric factors by incorporating molecular descriptors related to size and shape into the rules.** Modify rules to exclude bulky substituents that may hinder coordination:

  ```python
  patterns['bulky_substituents'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc(ccc1)[C](C)(C)C')
  ```

  This prevents overestimation of yield for modifiers with steric hindrance.

- **Advice 8**: **Validate the refined rules using unit tests with known compounds to ensure accuracy.** Create a test suite that includes positive and negative examples for each rule. For instance:

  ```python
  test_compounds = {
      'high_yield_examples': ['O=C(O)C(N)CC(=O)O', 'c1ccc(cc1[NH2])C(=O)O'],
      'low_yield_examples': ['c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O', 'CCCCCCCC(=O)O'],
  }
  ```

  Use these tests to verify that the rules correctly classify compounds.

- **Advice 9**: **Implement iterative testing and refinement by assessing rule performance on different data subsets.** Apply cross-validation to evaluate how well the rules generalize:

  ```python
  from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

  kf = KFold(n_splits=5)
  for train_index, test_index in kf.split(data):
      # Split data
      # Apply rules
      # Evaluate performance
  ```

  Continuous refinement based on validation results will enhance rule accuracy.

- **Advice 10**: **Collaborate with chemists and data scientists to validate the chemical rationale of each rule and adjust them based on expert feedback.** Discuss the proposed changes to ensure they align with chemical principles and improve predictive performance.

**End of Advice**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *α-amino dicarboxylic acids* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The presence of an amino group at the α-carbon and two carboxylate groups allows for multiple coordination points with the metal center. This multidentate binding enhances catalyst stability and activity by forming strong complexes, facilitating efficient electron transfer during the reaction.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids* with an *amino* or *nitro* group result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Amino and nitro groups at the para position influence the electronic properties of the aromatic ring and increase the acidity of the carboxyl group. This enhances metal-ligand coordination by strengthening the binding to the metal ion. Additionally, these substituents can participate in coordination with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heterocyclic carboxylic acids* containing *nitrogen atoms* capable of coordinating to metals result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as electron donors and coordinate with metal centers. This coordination increases the electron density at the metal ion and enhances the stability of the catalyst through chelation, improving catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with multiple *hydroxyl groups* (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding. This multidentate interaction strengthens the metal-ligand complex, enhancing catalyst performance by facilitating effective electron transfer processes.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* with a *thiol group* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Thiol groups have a high affinity for metal ions, forming strong metal-sulfur bonds. In short-chain acids, the minimal steric hindrance allows the thiol and carboxyl groups to coordinate simultaneously with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* without additional functional groups and chain lengths up to 8 carbons result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: These acids can effectively coordinate with metal centers through their carboxyl group without interference from other functional groups. The optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, maintaining catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* substituted with *aldehyde* (formyl) groups on the aromatic ring result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can undergo side reactions, such as condensation or oxidation, which may deactivate the catalyst. They can also interfere with metal coordination by competing with the carboxyl group, reducing effective metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-donating methyl or methoxy groups* at the *para position* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups like methyl and methoxy decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. They do not provide additional coordination sites, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (more than 6 carbons) with terminal *amino* or *hydroxyl* groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Long aliphatic chains increase flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination of functional groups to the metal center. This results in weaker metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *thiol groups* on the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to catalyst poisoning.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic thiol groups can form very strong bonds with metal centers, potentially leading to irreversible binding that deactivates the catalyst by blocking active sites needed for the reaction.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with long *polyether chains* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The ether oxygen atoms have lone pairs but are poor ligands due to resonance delocalization and the electron-withdrawing effect of adjacent oxygen atoms. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains hinder effective coordination with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorine's strong electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate group, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal ions. The resultant weak metal-ligand interactions lead to poor catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with *non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains*, such as a *phenyl* or *thioether* group, result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms do not contribute to metal binding. Hydrophobic groups like phenyl and thioether do not facilitate additional interactions with the metal center and may introduce steric hindrance, resulting in weaker overall coordination.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *dicarboxylic acids* with *keto groups* in the chain result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ketone groups can participate in keto-enol tautomerism and may interfere with metal coordination by engaging in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or forming enolates. This reduces the availability of coordination sites for the metal ion and may lead to side reactions.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are *strong chelating agents* forming *insoluble complexes* with the metal center result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Strong chelating ligands can sequester the metal ion, forming inactive species or precipitates. This depletes the amount of active catalyst available for the reaction, resulting in lower yields.

---

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Combine Rules with Limited Coverage to Enhance Robustness**

  Consider merging Rules 4, 5, and 6 into a more general rule about **aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional coordinating functional groups resulting in high yield**. These rules individually have limited data support but share a common theme of aliphatic acids enhancing yield through coordination via functional groups like hydroxyl or thiol. A combined rule could be:

  - **Revised Rule**: *Modifiers that are short to medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (up to 8 carbons) with additional coordinating groups such as hydroxyl or thiol result in **high yield**.*

  - **Rationale**: The presence of additional coordinating groups provides multiple binding sites to the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and performance.

- **Advice 2**: **Merge Similar Low-Yield Rules to Increase Clarity and Support**

  Combine Rules 10, 13, and 15, which all involve modifiers that lead to catalyst deactivation due to strong binding or chelation, into a single rule:

  - **Revised Rule**: *Modifiers containing functional groups that strongly bind to the metal center (e.g., aromatic thiols, strong chelating agents, or highly hydrophobic non-coordinating side chains) result in **low yield** due to catalyst deactivation or poisoning.*

  - **Rationale**: Strongly binding groups can sequester the metal ion or block active sites, reducing the availability of active catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Advice 3**: **Reassess and Potentially Remove Under-Supported Rules**

  Evaluate Rules 11, 12, and 14, which have only one supporting data point each. If additional data cannot be provided, consider removing these rules to streamline the rule set and focus on more strongly supported relationships.

- **Advice 4**: **Collect Additional Data to Strengthen Weak Rules**

  For rules with limited coverage, such as Rules 5 and 10, seek out or generate additional experimental data. This could involve testing more modifiers with similar structures to see if they consistently result in high or low yields, thereby strengthening the rule's validity.

- **Advice 5**: **Refine Rules for Specificity and Practical Application**

  Adjust rules to be more specific where necessary. For example, in Rule 9, specify the exact chain length considered as "long-chain" and clarify what constitutes terminal functional groups. This precision will make the rules more practical for predicting outcomes.

- **Advice 6**: **Simplify Overly Complex Rules without Losing Essential Information**

  Simplify rules that may be too narrowly defined. For instance, Rules 7 and 8 both deal with substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids affecting yield due to electronic effects. These can be combined:

  - **Revised Rule**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or reactive groups (e.g., aldehyde) on the aromatic ring result in **low yield**.*

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating and reactive groups can decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group or participate in side reactions, reducing effective metal coordination and catalyst performance.

- **Advice 7**: **Standardize Terminology and Criteria Across Rules**

  Ensure consistent use of terms like "short-chain," "long-chain," "electron-donating," and "electron-withdrawing." Define these terms explicitly within the rules (e.g., short-chain aliphatic acids have fewer than six carbons) to eliminate ambiguity and improve rule clarity.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Functional Group Interactions into Rules**

  Consider how combinations of functional groups impact the yield. For example, modifiers with both electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups may have different effects than those with only one such group. Adjust rules to account for synergistic or antagonistic interactions between functional groups.

- **Advice 9**: **Prioritize Rules with Strong Experimental Support**

  Focus on refining rules that are strongly supported by multiple data points and have clear rationales (e.g., Rules 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9). These rules will form the foundation of the rule set and provide reliable guidance for predicting reaction outcomes.

- **Advice 10**: **Use Quantitative Criteria Where Possible**

  Where applicable, incorporate quantitative measures such as pKa values, electronegativity, or steric parameters to enhance the predictive power of the rules. This can help in distinguishing modifiers that may have borderline effects on yield.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *α-amino dicarboxylic acids* (amino acids with two carboxylate groups at positions α and γ) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The presence of an amino group at the α-carbon and two carboxylate groups increases coordination sites for metal binding. This multidentate interaction enhances the stability of the metal-ligand complex, facilitating effective electron transfer and improving catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-withdrawing groups* (e.g., amino, nitro) at the *para position* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, strengthening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. They may also provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the ligand, enhancing catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *heterocyclic carboxylic acids* containing *nitrogen atoms* capable of coordinating to metals result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as coordination sites, binding to metal centers and increasing electron density at the metal ion. This enhances catalyst stability and reactivity through effective metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with additional coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, mercapto) within three carbons of the carboxyl group result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Additional coordinating groups close to the carboxyl enhance chelation with the metal center, forming stable five- or six-membered chelate rings. This improves the efficiency of electron transfer processes and catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-donating groups* (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the *para position* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its coordination ability with metal ions. They do not provide additional coordination sites and can reduce the effectiveness of metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *aldehyde groups* on the aromatic ring result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or interfere with metal coordination by forming complexes that are less active or inactive, thus reducing catalyst efficiency.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Strongly electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease the electron density on the carboxylate group, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. This results in poor metal-ligand interactions and diminished catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* with no additional functional groups and chain lengths up to eight carbons result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: These acids can effectively coordinate with metal centers through their carboxyl group without steric hindrance. The optimal chain length maintains a balance between hydrophobic interactions and solubility, supporting catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* (more than six carbons) with terminal *amino* or *hydroxy* groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The increased chain length and terminal positioning of functional groups lead to flexibility and reduced effectiveness in chelation. The coordinating groups are too distant from the carboxyl group to form stable chelate rings, weakening metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with *hydrophobic side chains* lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Hydrophobic side chains without heteroatoms do not facilitate additional coordination with the metal center. This limits metal-ligand interactions to the amino and carboxyl groups, which may not be sufficient for effective catalyst enhancement.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that contain *polyether chains* result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Polyether chains introduce steric bulk and flexibility, hindering effective coordination with the metal center. The ether oxygen atoms are poor ligands due to delocalization of lone pair electrons and do not contribute significantly to metal binding.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *thiol groups* on the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to catalyst poisoning.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic thiol groups can form very strong, sometimes irreversible bonds with metal centers, blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with side chains containing *coordinating heteroatoms* integrated into *aromatic heterocycles* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Aromatic heterocycles with heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring) can coordinate to metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through additional metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with substituents capable of *chelation via keto and hydroxyl groups* result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The presence of chelating groups such as adjacent keto and hydroxyl (or enolizable keto) groups can form stable chelate rings with metal ions, enhancing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are *carboxylic acids* with *multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups* (polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites for metal binding. This multidentate interaction strengthens the metal-ligand complex and enhances catalytic efficiency.

The rule is clear, and the property insight about chelation and ring formation is sound. Complexity is addressed by combining the carboxyl group with nearby functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, mercapto). Supported by examples like 5-aminopentanoic acid, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, and gluconic acid, it has good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** states that **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position result in low yield**. Clarity is maintained, and the property insight explains reduced acidity and coordination ability. The rule combines substructures (aromatic ring, carboxyl group, para electron-donating substituents), satisfying complexity. It is supported by data points like 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, ensuring adequate coverage and balance.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** mentions that **modifiers with aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxyl group or on the aromatic ring result in low yield**. The rule is clear, and the property insight about interference with metal coordination is valid. Complexity arises from combining aldehyde and carboxyl functionalities. With examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, coverage is adequate, and the rule is balanced.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** states that **perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids result in low yield**. While the rule is clear and provides property insight on fluorine's electron-withdrawing effects, it focuses on a single substructure, limiting complexity. Coverage is weak, supported by only one data point (nonafluoropentanoic acid). The rule lacks sufficient examples to strengthen its validity and balance.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** specifies that **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (seven or more carbons) and terminal functional groups result in low yield**. Clarity is good, and the property insight about reduced chelation likelihood is sound. The rule combines chain length and functional group position, meeting complexity criteria. Supported by data points like 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid, it has good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** indicates that **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on the ring result in low yield due to catalyst poisoning**. Clarity is acceptable, and the property insight is strong regarding thiol-induced deactivation. However, complexity is limited, and coverage is poor with only one example (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid). Additional data points are needed for better support and balance.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** states that **modifiers including polyether chains result in low yield**. The rule is clear, and the property insight about steric hindrance and poor ligand ability is reasonable. Complexity is low, focusing mainly on the presence of polyether chains. Coverage is insufficient, supported by a single data point (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), necessitating more examples for validation.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** mentions that **amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yield**. Clarity is adequate, and the property insight about limited metal-ligand interactions is valid. Complexity includes both amino acid backbone and side-chain properties. Coverage is limited to one data point (phenylalanine), requiring additional examples to enhance reliability and balance.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** specifies that **amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms within aromatic heterocycles result in high yield**. The rule is clear, and the property insight is solid regarding additional coordination sites. Complexity is acceptable, combining amino acid structure with specific side chains. However, coverage is weak with only one example (tryptophan), limiting its strength and balance.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** states that **carboxylic acids with adjacent hydroxyl groups or multiple hydroxyl groups result in high yield**. Clarity is good, and the property insight about enhanced chelation is appropriate. Complexity involves multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group. Coverage is limited to one data point (gluconic acid), needing more examples for validation and better balance.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** indicates that **modifiers with rigid structures containing chelating groups result in high yield**. Clarity could be improved with more specific structural descriptions. The property insight is acceptable, focusing on stable bidentate complexes. Complexity is moderate, combining rigidity and chelating groups. Coverage is limited to one example (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), suggesting a need for more data points to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** mentions that **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups or with long carbon chains show variable effects on yield**. The rule lacks clarity and specificity, making it difficult to predict outcomes. Property insight is limited, and complexity is low due to vagueness. Although it references both high and low yield examples, the rule does not provide clear guidance, indicating poor balance and the need for refinement.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Consolidate Rules with Limited Coverage to Strengthen Predictive Power.** Rules 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 are each supported by only one data point, which does not meet the coverage criterion for robust rule formation. Consider merging these rules with others that share similar structural features or underlying principles to improve their validity. For example, combine Rule 7 (perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids) with Rule 5 (aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups resulting in low yield) under a broader rule about electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents affecting metal coordination.

- **Advice 2**: **Enhance Coverage by Including Additional Supporting Data Points.** To meet the coverage criterion, gather more data for rules currently supported by only one example. This could involve experimental validation of additional modifiers possessing similar structural features or mining existing literature for relevant data. Increasing the number of supporting examples will strengthen the reliability and applicability of these rules.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rules to Reduce Overlap and Improve Clarity.** Some rules overlap or are too vague, such as Rule 13 (modifiers with adjacent hydroxyl groups) overlapping with Rule 4 (aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups near the carboxyl group). Merge overlapping rules and clarify their distinctions to avoid redundancy. For instance, combine Rules 4 and 13 into a single rule that encompasses aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal coordinating groups, specifying the types of functional groups included.

- **Advice 4**: **Remove or Revise Rules with Insufficient Data and Low Complexity.** Rules that lack complexity (i.e., focus on a single substructure) and have limited data support should be reconsidered. For example, Rule 12 (aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups) and Rule 14 (modifiers with rigid structures containing chelating groups) could be removed if additional data is not available. Alternatively, revise these rules to incorporate them into more general rules with better support.

- **Advice 5**: **Prioritize Rules with Strong Property Insights and Balanced Complexity and Coverage.** Focus on rules like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 that meet all the criteria (clarity, property insight, complexity, coverage, and balance). These rules provide clear guidance based on well-understood chemical principles and are supported by multiple data points, making them reliable for practical applications.

- **Advice 6**: **Expand Rule Examples to Include Varied Functional Groups and Structures.** Enrich the rules by adding more examples that cover a broader range of modifiers. This not only improves coverage but also enhances the rule's applicability to diverse chemical spaces. For instance, in Rule 3, include additional heterocyclic acids with nitrogen coordination sites to strengthen the rule.

- **Advice 7**: **Strengthen Rationales with Detailed Physicochemical Explanations.** Ensure that each rule's rationale provides deep insights into the underlying chemical phenomena. Elaborate on how specific functional groups influence metal coordination, electron transfer, and catalytic activity. This reinforces the scientific validity of the rules and aids users in understanding and applying them effectively.

- **Advice 8**: **Simplify Rules Where Possible Without Losing Essential Information.** While complexity is necessary, overly complicated rules can hinder practical application. Aim for simplicity by focusing on key structural features that significantly impact yield. For example, in Rule 15, instead of stating that aliphatic carboxylic acids show variable effects, specify conditions under which they result in high or low yield based on chain length and functionalization.

- **Advice 9**: **Include Structural Diagrams or SMILES Notations for Clarity.** Providing visual representations of the modifiers discussed in the rules can enhance understanding and make it easier for users to identify and apply the rules to new compounds. Incorporate structural diagrams or SMILES strings where appropriate.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate Rules Through Computational Modeling or Experimental Data.** To further strengthen the rules, consider performing computational studies (e.g., DFT calculations) or additional experiments to test and confirm the proposed interactions and effects. This additional validation adds robustness to the rules and increases confidence in their predictive capability.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The presence of an amino group at the α-carbon and an extra carboxyl group in the side chain allows for multidentate chelation with metal centers. This enhances the stability of the metal-ligand complex and improves catalytic activity by facilitating effective electron transfer.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, strengthening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. They enhance metal-ligand interactions by increasing the ligand's electron-accepting capacity, which improves catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metals result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, forming stronger complexes with metal centers. This enhances the electron density at the metal ion, improving catalytic reactivity.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, mercapto) within three carbons of the carboxyl group result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Additional functional groups close to the carboxyl group facilitate chelation by forming stable five- or six-membered rings with metal ions. This multidentate binding enhances catalyst stability and efficiency.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the para position result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its coordination ability with metal ions. This leads to less effective metal-ligand interactions and reduced catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that have aldehyde functional groups adjacent to the carboxyl group or on the aromatic ring result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination or undergo side reactions, forming less active complexes and diminishing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the electron density on the carboxylate group, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. This results in poor metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (seven or more carbons) and terminal functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Terminal functional groups distant from the carboxyl group reduce the likelihood of effective chelation with metal centers. The increased chain length adds flexibility, hindering stable complex formation.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to catalyst poisoning.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Thiol groups can form strong, sometimes irreversible bonds with metal centers, blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that include polyether chains in their structure result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Polyether chains introduce steric bulk and flexibility, hindering effective coordination with metal centers. The oxygen atoms in ethers are poor ligands due to their low donor ability.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Hydrophobic side chains without heteroatoms do not facilitate additional coordination with metal centers. Limited metal-ligand interactions reduce catalytic enhancement.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms within aromatic heterocycles result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites, strengthening metal-ligand complexes and improving catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with adjacent hydroxyl groups (α-hydroxy acids) or multiple hydroxyl groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group enhance the ability to chelate metal ions through multiple coordination points, forming stable complexes that boost catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with rigid structures containing chelating groups (e.g., adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups in aromatic systems) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Rigid chelating ligands can form stable, bidentate complexes with metal centers, enhancing the efficiency of electron transfer processes in catalysis.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups or with long carbon chains show variable effects on yield and may require further analysis.**

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **Octanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: While simple aliphatic carboxylic acids can coordinate with metal centers via the carboxyl group, the absence of additional coordinating groups or the presence of multiple carboxyl groups can influence the overall effectiveness. The impact on yield may depend on subtle structural differences and requires case-by-case evaluation.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **For Rule 1**, the SMARTS pattern for the side chain carboxyl group (`side_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) may not capture all possible side chain carboxylic acids in α-amino acids. The pattern requires a specific `[CH2]` group attached to the carboxyl group, which may miss cases where the side chain has more complex structures (e.g., additional substituents or longer chains). To improve this, consider using a more general pattern that captures any side chain containing a carboxylic acid group, such as `'[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 2**: **For Rule 2**, the code includes specific patterns for electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (nitro, bromine, amino), but it does not include the bromomethyl group mentioned in the rule. Additionally, the pattern `'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)[O,H,-]'` does not enforce that the substituent is at the para position. To accurately capture para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups, modify the pattern to enforce para substitution. For example, use `'c1cc([$(N),$(N(=O)=O),$(CBr)]c(cc1)C(=O)[O,H])'` where `$(N)` matches amino, `$(N(=O)=O)` matches nitro, and `$(CBr)` matches bromomethyl groups at the para position.

- **Suggestion 3**: **For Rule 3**, the SMARTS patterns in the code (`'[nH]1cncc1C(=O)[O,H,-]', '[n]1cccc1C(=O)[O,H,-]'`) may not capture all heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing coordinating nitrogen atoms. These patterns are specific to certain heterocycles. To generalize, consider using a pattern that matches any nitrogen-containing heterocycle attached to a carboxylic acid, such as `'[n;R][#6;R]C(=O)[O,H,-]'`.

- **Suggestion 4**: **For Rule 4**, the patterns for additional coordinating groups (`'[CX4][CX4][OX2H]', '[CX4][CX4][NX3H2]', '[CX4][CX4][SX2H]'`) require the coordinating group to be exactly three carbons away from the carboxyl group, which may exclude modifiers where the functional group is within three carbons but not necessarily exactly three carbons away. To correct this, adjust the patterns to allow for the coordinating group to be on any of the first three carbons, for example: `'[CX4][CX4][CX4][$(O),$(N),$(S)]'`.

- **Suggestion 5**: **For Rule 5**, the code patterns do not enforce the position of the electron-donating groups (methoxy, methyl) being at the para position. The pattern `'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)[O,H,-]'` matches any aromatic carboxylic acid without specifying substitution patterns. To accurately capture para-substituted electron-donating groups, use patterns like `'c1cc([$(OC),$(C)]c(cc1)C(=O)[O,H])'`.

- **Suggestion 6**: **For Rule 6**, the SMARTS patterns (`'[CX3](=O)[CX3H](=O)[#6]', '[c][CH](=O)'`) may not capture all cases where an aldehyde group is adjacent to a carboxyl group or on the aromatic ring. The first pattern may be too restrictive. To improve it, use more general patterns such as `'[CX3](=O)[CX3H](=O)'` for adjacent aldehyde and carboxyl groups and `'c[CH]=O'` for aldehyde on the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 7**: **For Rule 7**, the SMARTS pattern for perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids is very specific (`'[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])C(=O)[O,H,-]'`) and may only match one specific compound. To generalize to any perfluoroalkyl chain ending with a carboxylic acid, consider using a recursive SMARTS pattern like `'[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])...C(=O)[O,H,-]'` or `'[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])*C(=O)[O,H,-]'`.

- **Suggestion 8**: **For Rule 8**, the code patterns for long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal functional groups (`'[CX4]([CX4H2]){5,}[CX4][NX3H2]', '[CX4]([CX4H2]){5,}[CX4][OX2H]'`) may not be correctly formatted. The `{5,}` repetition syntax needs to be enclosed properly within the SMARTS pattern. Additionally, ensure that the patterns accurately match chains of seven or more carbons. Adjust the patterns to `'[CH2]CCCCCC[CH2][NX3H2]'` and `'[CH2]CCCCCC[CH2][OX2H]'` or use a more general pattern like `'[CX4H2][$([CX4H2])]{5,}[CX4H2][NX3H2]'`.

- **Suggestion 9**: **For Rule 9**, the pattern `'c1cc(SH)ccc1C(=O)[O,H,-]'` correctly identifies thiol groups on the aromatic ring, but it may not account for different positions of the thiol group. Ensure that the pattern matches any aromatic carboxylic acid with a thiol substituent on the ring, regardless of its position. Use a pattern like `'c[c;R][c;R][S][H]'` attached to a carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 10**: **For Rule 10**, the SMARTS pattern for polyether chains (`'[OX2H][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2H]'`) is too specific and may not match all modifiers with polyether chains. To generalize, use a pattern that matches any polyether chain, such as `'[OX2H][CX4]([OX2][CX4]){2,}[OX2H]'`.

- **Suggestion 11**: **For Rule 11**, the pattern for hydrophobic side chains (`'[CX4][CX4][c]'`) may not capture all hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups. Hydrophobic side chains can include various alkyl and aromatic groups. To improve this, use a pattern that matches side chains without heteroatoms, such as `'[CX4][CX4][CX4]'` or `'[CX4][CX4][#6;!$([#6][#7,#8,#15,#16,#17,#35,#53])]'`.

- **Suggestion 12**: **For Rule 12**, the pattern for coordinating heteroatoms within aromatic heterocycles (`'[CX4][c][n]'`) may be too restrictive. It only matches specific structures where the side chain is directly attached to an aromatic nitrogen. To include amino acids like tryptophan, adjust the pattern to `'[CX4][c][c][n]'` or more generally `'[CX4][a][a][n]`', where `[a]` represents any aromatic atom.

- **Suggestion 13**: **For Rule 13**, the patterns for adjacent hydroxyl groups (`'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][OX2H]'`) may not match all α-hydroxy acids or modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups. To improve this, include patterns for α-hydroxy acids and sugars with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][OX2H][CX4][OX2H]'` and consider using recursive SMARTS to match multiple hydroxyls.

- **Suggestion 14**: **For Rule 14**, the pattern `'c1cc(c(=O)o1)C(=O)[O,H,-]'` is very specific and may only match one compound. To generalize for rigid structures containing chelating groups like adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups in aromatic systems, consider a pattern like `'c1cc([C](=O)[OX2H1])[c;R]c1C(=O)[O,H,-]'`.

- **Suggestion 15**: **The code does not include Rule 15**, which discusses modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups or with long carbon chains showing variable effects on yield. To fully represent all rules in the feature matrix, Rule 15 should be added to the code with appropriate SMARTS patterns and logic.

- **Suggestion 16**: **Ensure consistency in SMARTS syntax**. Some patterns use deprecated syntax or may have formatting issues (e.g., `[CX4][CX4][CX4][$(O),$(N),$(S)]` should be adjusted for correct SMARTS notation). Review and validate all SMARTS strings using cheminformatics tools like RDKit to ensure they are syntactically correct.

- **Suggestion 17**: **Improve error handling in the code**. If a SMILES string cannot be parsed, the current code appends a row of zeros. Consider logging or reporting these cases to address potential data issues.

- **Suggestion 18**: **Validate the final feature matrix against known examples**. Cross-check the feature matrix with the examples provided in each rule to ensure that the rules are correctly implemented and that the matrix accurately reflects the expected outcomes.

**End of Suggestions**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Structural Rules into Quantifiable Molecular Descriptors**

  Reframe the rules to focus on quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. Instead of qualitative descriptions (e.g., "Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups"), specify descriptors such as:
  
  - Number of electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, cyano groups)
  - Position of substituents relative to functional groups (e.g., para position)
  - Presence and count of specific functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol)
  
  This will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix by providing clear, countable features.

- **Advice 2**: **Break Down Complex Rules into Simple, Measurable Features**

  Decompose complex rules into simpler sub-rules that correspond to measurable features. For example, Rule 4 can be broken down into:
  
  - Distance (in number of bonds) between the carboxyl group and additional coordinating groups
  - Type of coordinating groups present (e.g., amino, hydroxyl)
  
  This enables the direct extraction of numeric values from molecular structures.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Standard Molecular Descriptors and Physicochemical Properties**

  Utilize standard molecular descriptors and calculated physicochemical properties that are routinely obtained from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools:
  
  - Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)
  - Molecular weight
  - Octanol-water partition coefficient (LogP)
  - Hydrogen bond donors and acceptors count
  - pKa values
  
  Modifying the rules to include these properties allows for a seamless conversion into a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 4**: **Use Molecular Fingerprints for Feature Generation**

  Adopt molecular fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) that encode the presence or absence of substructures in a binary or count format. Align the rules with specific fingerprint bits or patterns so that they can be directly used in computational models.

- **Advice 5**: **Provide Explicit Numerical Thresholds and Ranges**

  Where applicable, include numerical thresholds within the rules. For instance:
  
  - "Modifiers with a TPSA greater than 75 Å² result in high yield."
  - "Modifiers with LogP between -1 and 2 result in high yield."
  
  This creates clear criteria that can be directly translated into numeric features.

- **Advice 6**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions**

  Define functional groups and substituents using standardized substructure patterns. For example, specify electron-withdrawing groups as nitro, cyano, sulfonyl, etc., and provide SMARTS patterns for identification. This facilitates automated detection and feature extraction.

- **Advice 7**: **Quantify Coordination Ability Through Donor Atom Counts**

  Replace qualitative assessments of coordination ability with quantifiable counts of donor atoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) within a certain radius from the coordinating site:
  
  - "Number of donor atoms within 3 bonds of the carboxyl group."
  
  This numerical feature directly relates to the chelation potential affecting catalytic activity.

- **Advice 8**: **Assign Numerical Values to Steric and Electronic Effects**

  Quantify steric hindrance and electronic effects using established scales:
  
  - Taft steric parameters
  - Hammett sigma constants for substituents
  
  Incorporate these values into the rules to numerically represent the steric and electronic influences on yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Create a Feature Matrix Template Matching the Rules**

  Develop a template for a feature matrix where each column corresponds to a specific descriptor from the rules. Ensure that for every modifier, the relevant features can be extracted and populated into the matrix, aiding in model training and prediction.

- **Advice 10**: **Use Machine Learning to Refine and Validate Rules**

  Utilize machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to analyze the existing dataset and identify the most significant features correlating with high or low yield. This data-driven approach can help refine the rules and ensure they are grounded in quantifiable predictors.

- **Advice 11**: **Provide Clear Examples Linking Rules to Numerical Features**

  For each rule, include examples showing how modifiers align with numerical features. For instance:
  
  - Rule: "Modifiers with more than two hydroxyl groups result in high yield."
  - Example: Gluconic acid has five hydroxyl groups → High yield (True)
  
  This aids in understanding how to apply the rules quantitatively.

- **Advice 12**: **Eliminate Ambiguity by Defining Clear Boundaries**

  Ensure that the rules are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive by defining clear boundaries. For example, specify exact chain lengths or number ranges:
  
  - "Modifiers with aliphatic chains of 6 to 8 carbons result in low yield."
  
  This precision removes ambiguity, facilitating straightforward feature assignment.

- **Advice 13**: **Integrate Side Chain Flexibility Parameters**

  Include descriptors that account for flexibility or rigidity of the modifier molecules, such as:
  
  - Number of rotatable bonds
  - Presence of ring structures (aromatic or aliphatic)
  
  These parameters can influence the ability of the modifier to coordinate with metal centers and can be numerically quantified.

- **Advice 14**: **Consider Electronic Parameters of Functional Groups**

  Incorporate electronic parameters such as dipole moments or partial charges of functional groups, which can be calculated computationally. These values can correlate with the coordination strength and catalytic activity.

- **Advice 15**: **Update Rules Based on Statistical Analysis**

  Perform statistical analysis (e.g., regression analysis) on the dataset to identify significant predictors of yield. Update the rules to reflect these findings, ensuring they are backed by quantitative evidence.

**End of Advice**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The presence of an amino group at the α-carbon and extra carboxyl groups in the side chain allows for multidentate chelation with metal centers. This enhances the stability of the metal-ligand complex and improves catalytic activity by facilitating effective coordination with the metal ion.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Additional coordinating groups close to the carboxyl group facilitate chelation by forming stable five- or six-membered rings with metal ions. This multidentate binding enhances catalyst stability and efficiency.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogen) at the para position result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, strengthening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. Enhanced metal-ligand interactions improve catalyst performance by facilitating effective electron transfer.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing coordinating nitrogen atoms result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, forming stronger complexes with metal centers. This enhances the electron density at the metal ion, improving catalytic reactivity.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group (e.g., polyhydroxy acids) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the number of coordination sites, facilitating strong binding to metal centers and improving catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the para position result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its coordination ability with metal ions. This leads to less effective metal-ligand interactions and reduced catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that have aldehyde (formyl) groups on the aromatic ring result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination or undergo side reactions, forming less active complexes and diminishing catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long carbon chains (>6 carbons) without additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Long-chain aliphatic acids can effectively coordinate with metal centers via the carboxyl group. The lack of additional functional groups reduces steric hindrance, allowing for better catalyst interaction.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that contain thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Thiol groups can form strong, sometimes irreversible bonds with metal centers, blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the electron density on the carboxylate group, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. This results in poor metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Hydrophobic side chains without heteroatoms do not facilitate additional coordination with metal centers. Limited metal-ligand interactions reduce catalytic enhancement.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains containing nitrogen atoms result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Heteroaromatic side chains with nitrogen atoms provide additional coordination sites, forming stronger complexes with metal ions and improving catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Polyether chains introduce steric bulk and flexibility, hindering effective coordination with metal centers. The oxygen atoms in ethers are less effective as ligands due to their lone pairs being involved in resonance.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that contain keto groups adjacent to the carboxyl group in aliphatic chains result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Keto groups near the carboxyl group can interfere with metal coordination by forming internal hydrogen bonds or enolate forms, reducing the availability of coordination sites.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl groups result in **variable yield**, and their effect depends on the overall molecular structure.**

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
    - **Low Yield**: **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can enhance coordination through chelation, but the overall effectiveness depends on additional structural factors that influence metal-ligand interactions.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By combining multiple substructures and considering physicochemical properties, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in high or low yield.

The rules prioritize broad coverage of the dataset and balance simplicity with complexity. They serve as a valuable guide for selecting or designing molecular modifiers to optimize and control the reaction yield based on their structural characteristics.

**Summary of Key Insights:**

- **Coordination Ability**: Modifiers that can chelate the metal ion through multiple coordination sites (e.g., additional carboxyl, amino, or hydroxyl groups) tend to result in high yield due to enhanced catalyst stability and activity.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, leading to high yield. Conversely, electron-donating groups decrease coordination strength, resulting in low yield.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky or flexible groups, such as polyether chains or long aliphatic chains with distant functional groups, can hinder effective metal coordination and lower the yield.

- **Functional Group Interference**: Certain functional groups like aldehydes or thiols may interfere with metal coordination or deactivate the catalyst, leading to low yield.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the potential effectiveness of new modifiers and streamline the development of catalysts with improved performance for the target reaction.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Reframe Rules Using Specific Molecular Descriptors**

  Modify the existing rules to be based on specific molecular descriptors or substructures that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in high yield," specify the exact functional groups and their positions:
  
  - Identify electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (`[N+](=O)[O-]`), cyano (`C#N`), or halogens (`F`, `Cl`, `Br`, `I`) attached at the para position relative to the carboxyl group in aromatic rings.
  
  This specificity allows for the automatic generation of features from SMILES representations.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Quantifiable Molecular Properties**

  Incorporate quantifiable molecular properties into the rules, such as:
  
  - **Electronic Parameters**: Hammett sigma constants, calculated partial charges, or electronegativity of substituents.
  - **Steric Parameters**: Sterimol parameters or molecular volume.
  - **Hydrophobicity**: LogP values.
  
  These properties can be calculated computationally and used to numerically evaluate the modifiers' impact on yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Encode Functional Groups as Numerical Features**

  Translate the presence of functional groups into numerical features:
  
  - For each modifier, count the number of specific functional groups (e.g., carboxyl groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, thiol groups).
  - Indicate the position of these groups relative to each other (e.g., amino group within three carbons of a carboxyl group).

- **Advice 4**: **Simplify and Generalize Rules**

  Simplify the rules to focus on the most impactful features that are easily quantifiable. For example:
  
  - **Rule**: "Modifiers with a total of two or more coordinating heteroatoms (N, O, S) within a three-atom distance result in high yield."
  
  This generalized rule can be applied numerically by counting coordinating heteroatoms within specified distances.

- **Advice 5**: **Develop a Feature Matrix Using Software Tools**

  Use cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit) to generate a numerical feature matrix from the SMILES strings:
  
  - Extract molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of rotatable bonds, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.
  - Calculate fingerprints that encode the molecular substructures and can be used in predictive models.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate pKa and Coordination Number**

  Include calculated pKa values and coordination numbers in the rules:
  
  - **Rule**: "Modifiers with carboxyl groups having pKa below a certain threshold (e.g., pKa < 4.5) result in high yield due to stronger acidity and better coordination with metal ions."
  
  pKa values can be computed from SMILES and used to predict coordination ability.

- **Advice 7**: **Quantify Steric Hindrance and Flexibility**

  Address steric effects numerically:
  
  - Calculate the steric bulk around coordinating atoms using parameters like molar refractivity or van der Waals volumes.
  - Include the number of rotatable bonds to quantify molecular flexibility affecting coordination.

- **Advice 8**: **Merge Overlapping Rules and Remove Redundancies**

  Combine similar rules to reduce complexity:
  
  - Merge rules related to electron-withdrawing groups into a single rule that specifies a range of electronegativity values or Hammett constants.
  - Eliminate rules that are exceptions or have variable effects, focusing on consistent trends.

- **Advice 9**: **Classify Modifiers Based on Quantitative Thresholds**

  Establish quantitative thresholds to classify modifiers:
  
  - **Hydrophobicity**: Modifiers with LogP > 2 may result in low yield due to poor solubility.
  - **Molecular Weight**: Very high or low molecular weights might correlate with yield variations.
  
  Use these thresholds to create clear, numerically driven rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Incorporate Machine Learning for Rule Refinement**

  Use machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and identify correlations:
  
  - Apply decision trees or random forests to find the most significant features influencing yield.
  - Update the rules based on the features that the model identifies as important predictors.

- **Advice 11**: **Provide Numerical Examples for Each Rule**

  For better clarity, include examples with calculated numerical values:
  
  - List modifiers with their computed descriptors (e.g., pKa, electron affinity) and show how they fit within the rules.
  - This practice enhances understanding and facilitates the application of the rules to new compounds.

- **Advice 12**: **Standardize Descriptors Across the Dataset**

  Ensure that all descriptors used in the rules are consistently calculated for all modifiers:
  
  - Use the same software and parameters for descriptor calculations.
  - This standardization is crucial for accurate comparisons and rule application.

- **Advice 13**: **Consider 3D Molecular Features**

  Include three-dimensional descriptors that affect coordination:
  
  - Compute features like molecular conformations, coordination geometry preferences, and spatial arrangements of donor atoms.
  - Though more complex, these features can significantly impact metal-ligand interactions.

- **Advice 14**: **Establish a Clear Hierarchy of Rules**

  Prioritize rules based on their impact on yield:
  
  - Rank rules from most to least significant according to statistical analysis.
  - This helps focus on the most influential factors when selecting or designing modifiers.

- **Advice 15**: **Continuously Update Rules with New Data**

  As more data becomes available, revise the rules:
  
  - Validate rules against new modifiers and yields.
  - Use feedback loops to improve the accuracy and predictive power of the rules.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing multiple coordinating groups (e.g., carboxylate, amino, hydroxyl) in proximity result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The presence of multiple coordinating groups close to each other enhances the ability to chelate the metal center, improving catalyst efficiency through stronger and more stable metal-ligand complexes.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, strengthening its ability to coordinate with metal ions and enhancing catalytic activity through improved electron acceptance.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, forming strong complexes with metal centers and enhancing electron density at the metal ion, which improves catalytic reactivity.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the para position result in **low yield** unless they have additional functional groups capable of coordination.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Counterexample (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening coordination with metal ions. However, additional coordinating groups like an amino group can compensate by providing alternative coordination sites.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with functional groups that interfere with metal coordination, such as aldehydes or perfluoroalkyl chains, result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or inhibit coordination, while perfluoroalkyl chains are strongly electron-withdrawing, reducing the electron density of the carboxylate and weakening metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long carbon chains (>6 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in **high yield**; the presence of distal functional groups may reduce yield.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Long-chain aliphatic acids without interfering groups coordinate effectively via the carboxyl group. Additional functional groups may not assist in coordination and could introduce steric hindrance or reduce solubility, affecting catalyst interaction.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with sulfur-containing groups in aliphatic chains result in **high yield** if the sulfur atom can coordinate without causing catalyst deactivation.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Sulfur atoms can act as soft ligands for metal coordination. When attached to aliphatic chains, they enhance coordination without poisoning the catalyst. In contrast, aromatic thiols may bind too strongly, blocking active sites.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole rings) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Side chains with heteroatoms provide additional coordination sites, forming more stable and active metal-ligand complexes, improving catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains or bulky substituents near coordinating groups result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced effective coordination.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Steric hindrance from bulky or flexible chains can impede the approach of the coordinating groups to the metal center, decreasing catalyst efficiency.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing keto groups adjacent to the carboxyl group in aliphatic chains result in **low yield** due to potential interference with coordination.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Keto groups near carboxyl groups may form intramolecular interactions or enolize, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for effective metal coordination.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups tend to result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Hydrophobic side chains without heteroatoms do not offer additional coordination sites, leading to weaker metal-ligand interactions and less effective catalysis.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl groups result in **variable yield**, influenced by their ability to form chelating rings with metal centers.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can facilitate chelation, but the overall molecular structure and additional substituents affect their coordination effectiveness and thus the yield.

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate the relationships between structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By combining multiple substructures and considering physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, and steric factors, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in high or low yield.

**Summary of Key Insights:**

- **Coordination Enhancement**: Modifiers with multiple coordinating groups in close proximity (e.g., carboxylate, amino, hydroxyl, heterocyclic nitrogen) enhance metal-ligand interactions, leading to higher yields due to stronger and more stable catalyst complexes.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase carboxylate acidity and coordination strength, improving yield. Electron-donating groups can decrease coordination ability unless compensated by additional coordinating sites.

- **Steric and Structural Factors**: Modifiers with bulky substituents or flexible chains near coordinating groups hinder effective coordination, resulting in lower yields. The overall molecular geometry influences the ability to form stable chelates with the metal center.

- **Functional Group Interference**: Certain functional groups like aldehydes, perfluoroalkyl chains, or aromatic thiols may interfere with metal coordination or deactivate the catalyst, leading to low yields.

- **Position of Functional Groups**: The location of coordinating or interfering functional groups (e.g., sulfur atoms, hydroxyl groups) within the molecule affects their impact on the yield.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the potential effectiveness of new modifiers and inform the selection or design of molecular modifiers to optimize and control the reaction yield based on their structural characteristics.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear in identifying heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing coordinating nitrogen atoms as high-yield modifiers. The rule offers meaningful physical-chemical insight into how additional coordination sites enhance catalytic reactivity. It adequately considers combinations of substructures and is supported by data points from entries 16 and 22, meeting the coverage and complexity criteria.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** effectively distinguishes between modifiers that result in low yield due to electron-donating groups and those that can compensate with additional coordinating groups. The clarity is high, and the property insight regarding electronic effects on acidity and coordination is sound. The rule balances complexity by considering both electronic effects and additional functional groups, with coverage supported by entries 4, 23, and 30.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** clearly states that certain functional groups interfere with metal coordination, leading to low yield. The property insight is appropriate, explaining how aldehydes and perfluoroalkyl chains affect coordination. It is supported by multiple data points (entries 14, 19, 20), satisfying the coverage criterion and maintaining a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** provides a clear and practical guideline regarding aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains. The property insight is logical, considering steric factors and the presence of additional functional groups. The rule is supported by data entries 5, 29, and 34, demonstrating adequate coverage and balance.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is somewhat complex but provides valuable insights into the effects of sulfur-containing groups in different contexts. The rule distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic thiols, explaining the differences in coordination behavior. While coverage is limited to entries 10 and 18, it still meets the minimum criterion, and the property insight adds depth to the understanding of catalyst interactions.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** lacks sufficient coverage, as it is based on a single data point (entry 15). While the property insight regarding coordinating heteroatoms in side chains is valuable, the rule does not fully satisfy the coverage criterion. Additional data points are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** clearly identifies the impact of steric hindrance from flexible polyether chains or bulky substituents, providing solid property insight. It considers combinations of structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by data entries 11 and 32, meeting the coverage requirement and achieving a good balance.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is based on a single data point (entry 27), which does not meet the coverage criterion. While the rule offers reasonable property insight into how keto groups adjacent to carboxyl groups may interfere with coordination, more data points are necessary to confirm the validity of this rule.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** has limited coverage, with only one clear supporting data point (entry 13). Although the property insight about hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups is logical, the rule does not fully satisfy the coverage criterion and would benefit from additional supporting data.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** lacks clarity as it indicates "variable yield" without providing a clear predictive guideline. While the property insight acknowledges that ortho-hydroxyl groups can influence yield, the rule does not allow for a definitive classification of modifiers as high or low yield. This limits its usefulness, and it does not fully meet the clarity criterion.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing multiple coordinating groups (e.g., carboxylate, amino, hydroxyl) in proximity result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The presence of multiple coordinating groups close to each other enhances the ability to chelate the metal center, improving catalyst efficiency through stronger and more stable metal-ligand complexes.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, strengthening its ability to coordinate with metal ions and enhancing catalytic activity through improved electron acceptance.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, forming strong complexes with metal centers and enhancing electron density at the metal ion, which improves catalytic reactivity.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the para position result in **low yield** unless they have additional functional groups capable of coordination.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Counterexample (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening coordination with metal ions. However, additional coordinating groups like an amino group can compensate by providing alternative coordination sites.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with functional groups that interfere with metal coordination, such as aldehydes or perfluoroalkyl chains, result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or inhibit coordination, while perfluoroalkyl chains are strongly electron-withdrawing, reducing the electron density of the carboxylate and weakening metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long carbon chains (>6 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in **high yield**; the presence of distal functional groups may reduce yield.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Long-chain aliphatic acids without interfering groups coordinate effectively via the carboxyl group. Additional functional groups may not assist in coordination and could introduce steric hindrance or reduce solubility, affecting catalyst interaction.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with sulfur-containing groups in aliphatic chains result in **high yield** if the sulfur atom can coordinate without causing catalyst deactivation.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Sulfur atoms can act as soft ligands for metal coordination. When attached to aliphatic chains, they enhance coordination without poisoning the catalyst. In contrast, aromatic thiols may bind too strongly, blocking active sites.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole rings) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Side chains with heteroatoms provide additional coordination sites, forming more stable and active metal-ligand complexes, improving catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains or bulky substituents near coordinating groups result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced effective coordination.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Steric hindrance from bulky or flexible chains can impede the approach of the coordinating groups to the metal center, decreasing catalyst efficiency.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing keto groups adjacent to the carboxyl group in aliphatic chains result in **low yield** due to potential interference with coordination.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Keto groups near carboxyl groups may form intramolecular interactions or enolize, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for effective metal coordination.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups tend to result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Hydrophobic side chains without heteroatoms do not offer additional coordination sites, leading to weaker metal-ligand interactions and less effective catalysis.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl groups result in **variable yield**, influenced by their ability to form chelating rings with metal centers.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can facilitate chelation, but the overall molecular structure and additional substituents affect their coordination effectiveness and thus the yield.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate the relationships between structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By combining multiple substructures and considering physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, and steric factors, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in high or low yield.

**Summary of Key Insights:**

- **Coordination Enhancement**: Modifiers with multiple coordinating groups in close proximity (e.g., carboxylate, amino, hydroxyl, heterocyclic nitrogen) enhance metal-ligand interactions, leading to higher yields due to stronger and more stable catalyst complexes.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase carboxylate acidity and coordination strength, improving yield. Electron-donating groups can decrease coordination ability unless compensated by additional coordinating sites.

- **Steric and Structural Factors**: Modifiers with bulky substituents or flexible chains near coordinating groups hinder effective coordination, resulting in lower yields. The overall molecular geometry influences the ability to form stable chelates with the metal center.

- **Functional Group Interference**: Certain functional groups like aldehydes, perfluoroalkyl chains, or aromatic thiols may interfere with metal coordination or deactivate the catalyst, leading to low yields.

- **Position of Functional Groups**: The location of coordinating or interfering functional groups (e.g., sulfur atoms, hydroxyl groups) within the molecule affects their impact on the yield.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the potential effectiveness of new modifiers and inform the selection or design of molecular modifiers to optimize and control the reaction yield based on their structural characteristics.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Review and correct the implementation of Rule 1 in the code.** Currently, the feature matrix shows a value of 1 for Rule 1 across all SMILES, which is incorrect. This suggests that the code is not properly checking for multiple coordinating groups in proximity. Modify the code to ensure that:

  - It correctly identifies coordinating groups (carboxylate, amino, hydroxyl) using accurate SMARTS patterns.
  - It accurately determines proximity by checking if coordinating atoms are within a specified number of bonds (e.g., within 3 bonds) using `GetShortestPath`.
  - It only assigns a value of 1 to Rule 1 when multiple coordinating groups are truly in proximity.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Improve the detection of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position for Rule 2.** The code does not correctly identify when a strong EWG is present at the para position of an aromatic carboxylic acid. To fix this:

  - Ensure that the SMARTS patterns for EWGs such as nitro groups (`[NX3+](=O)[OX1-]`) and halogens (`[F,Cl,Br,I]`) are correctly defined and used.
  - Correct the logic for finding the para position relative to the carboxylate group on the aromatic ring.
  - Accurately check for these EWGs at the para position and assign a value of 1 to Rule 2 when the condition is met.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Verify and refine SMARTS patterns for functional groups and substructures.** Some SMARTS patterns may not accurately represent the intended groups. For example:

  - Review the pattern for perfluoroalkyl chains in Rule 5 to ensure it matches chains where all hydrogens are replaced with fluorines.
  - Double-check patterns for electron-donating groups (methyl and methoxy) to ensure they match only when attached at the para position of the aromatic ring.
  - Ensure that patterns for heterocyclic nitrogen atoms in Rule 3 correctly identify heterocycles capable of coordination.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Correct the additional checks in Rule 4 for electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position without additional coordinating groups.** The code may not be accurately identifying EDGs or considering additional coordinating groups properly. Adjust the code to:

  - Properly identify EDGs (e.g., methyl `[CH3]` and methoxy `CO` groups) at the para position.
  - Check for the absence of additional coordinating groups correctly.
  - Only assign a value of -1 to Rule 4 when the molecule fits the criteria.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Enhance the implementation of Rules 6 and 11 regarding chain length and presence of functional groups.**

  - For Rule 6, ensure that the code correctly identifies aliphatic carboxylic acids with carbon chains longer than six carbons and checks for the absence of functional groups that could reduce yield.
  - For Rule 11, verify that amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups are accurately detected and assigned a value of -1.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Add comprehensive unit tests for each rule using the examples provided.** Create test cases with molecules that should match and not match each rule to verify that the code functions as intended. This will help identify and fix any logical errors in the rule implementations.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Ensure the correct handling of overlapping functional groups and rules.** Some molecules may match multiple rules. The code should correctly process such cases without conflicts, and the feature matrix should reflect all applicable rules for each molecule.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Check for and fix any code indentation or logical flow issues.** Misalignment or incorrect indentation can cause the code to behave unexpectedly. Review the code to ensure that all loops, conditionals, and function definitions are properly indented and structured.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Use RDKit functions effectively to accurately analyze molecular structures.**

  - Utilize `GetSubstructMatches` and `HasSubstructMatch` correctly for pattern matching.
  - Leverage `GetRingInfo` and atom indices properly to navigate through the molecular structure, especially when identifying positions on aromatic rings.
  - Use appropriate methods to find neighboring atoms and bonds to check for the presence of specific functional groups.

- **Suggestion 10**: **After implementing the corrections, regenerate the feature matrix and validate it against expected results.** Compare the new feature matrix with the predicted outputs based on the rules and examples to confirm that the transformation is now effective.

**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

---

**Comparison with Reference Metrics**

*Previous Mean Metrics:*
- **Train Support:** ~0.1756
- **Train Confidence:** ~0.5874
- **Train Lift:** ~1.1304
- **Train Leverage:** ~0.0124

*Current Mean Metrics:*
- **Train Support:** ~0.0586
- **Train Confidence:** ~0.5948
- **Train Lift:** ~1.1890
- **Train Leverage:** ~0.0067

---

**Observations:**

1. **Confidence:**
   - The average **train confidence** has increased slightly from ~58.74% to ~59.48%.
   - This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, the rules are slightly more reliable in predicting high yield than before.
   - Individual rules, such as **Rule 4** (73.08% confidence) and **Rule 5** (62.12% confidence), show particularly high confidence levels.

2. **Lift:**
   - The average **train lift** has improved from ~1.1304 to ~1.1890.
   - A lift greater than 1 suggests that the rules are better at predicting high yield than random chance.
   - **Rule 4** stands out with a lift of ~1.469, indicating it is significantly better at predicting high yield compared to the baseline probability.

3. **Support:**
   - The average **train support** has decreased from ~17.56% to ~5.86%.
   - Lower support means that the rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset.
   - **Rule 3** has zero support, indicating it does not apply to any instances in the training data.
   - Only **Rule 2** (16.57%) and **Rule 5** (12.19%) have support values above 10%.

4. **Leverage:**
   - The average **train leverage** has decreased from ~0.0124 to ~0.0067.
   - Leverage measures the difference in the observed co-occurrence of the rule's condition and prediction versus what would be expected by chance.
   - A decrease in leverage suggests the rules provide less added value over random chance than before.
   - **Rule 5** has the highest leverage at ~0.0203, indicating it contributes positively to predicting high yield beyond chance expectations.

---

**Interpretation:**

- The **increase in confidence and lift** suggests that the current rules are more **accurate** when they are applicable.
- The **decrease in support and leverage** indicates that the rules are **applicable to fewer instances** and contribute less to the overall model predictive power.
- The **trade-off** here is between **accuracy** (confidence and lift) and **coverage** (support and leverage).

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum:**
  - The current metrics suggest that the model may have reached a point where further iterations using the same strategy yield diminishing returns in improving both confidence and support simultaneously.
  - The increase in confidence comes at the expense of support, indicating possible overfitting to a small subset of the data.

- **Need for Further Iterations:**
  - Given the low support and leverage, it would be beneficial to continue iterating to find rules that **balance confidence and support**.
  - Further iterations might explore **generalizing the rules** to cover more instances without significantly compromising confidence.

---

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Re-evaluate Rules with Low Support:**

   - **Rule 1 and Rule 4:**
     - Despite high confidence and lift, their support is low.
     - Consider **expanding the conditions** of these rules to include more instances.
     - Analyze if the strictness of conditions can be relaxed without significantly reducing confidence.

   - **Rule 3:**
     - With **zero support**, this rule does not contribute to the model.
     - It should be **removed or revised**.
     - Investigate why the rule doesn't apply to any instances. There might be a mismatch between the rule conditions and the dataset characteristics.

2. **Enhance Rules with Moderate Support and Confidence:**

   - **Rule 2 and Rule 5:**
     - These rules have higher support and reasonable confidence.
     - **Rule 5** especially has high leverage, indicating it effectively contributes to predicting high yield.
     - Consider **combining these rules** or creating **composite rules** to enhance coverage while maintaining confidence.

3. **Adjust Rules to Increase Support:**

   - Look for **common features** among high-yield instances that are not currently captured.
   - **Broaden criteria** where appropriate. For example:
     - **Rule 6** focuses on aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains.
     - Perhaps include medium-chain acids if they show acceptable yields.

4. **Address Overfitting:**

   - The high confidence with low support suggests potential overfitting to specific cases.
   - Include **cross-validation** to ensure rules generalize well to unseen data.
   - Incorporate **test metrics** to compare against training metrics for a more balanced evaluation.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data Features:**

   - Examine other molecular descriptors or properties that might correlate with high yield.
   - Utilize **machine learning techniques** to identify patterns that may not be immediately apparent.

6. **Refine Rule Conditions:**

   - **Simplify overly complex rules** to make them more general.
   - **For example:**
     - **Rule 7** could be explored further to include other soft ligands, not just sulfur-containing groups.
     - **Rule 12's** variable yield could be split into more specific sub-rules based on the position and effect of hydroxyl groups.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules demonstrates improved confidence and lift compared to previous iterations, indicating that when the rules apply, they are more effective at predicting high yields. However, the reduced support and leverage suggest that the rules are applicable to a smaller subset of the data, potentially limiting their practical utility.

To enhance the performance of the model, it is crucial to find a balance between **precision and coverage**. Increasing support without sacrificing confidence will make the rules more valuable for predicting outcomes across a broader range of modifiers.

Further iterations should focus on:

- **Generalizing rules** to include more data points.
- **Eliminating or revising non-contributing rules** (e.g., Rule 3).
- **Combining compatible rules** to enhance both support and confidence.
- **Incorporating additional features or data points** to uncover new predictive patterns.

By implementing these improvements, the rules will not only be accurate but also widely applicable, thereby providing more robust guidance in the catalytic problem under investigation.

---

**Next Steps:**

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Perform deeper analysis of the dataset to identify overlooked patterns.
   - Visualize the distribution of yields with respect to different molecular features.

2. **Rule Refinement:**
   - Use statistical techniques or machine learning algorithms to suggest potential rule modifications.
   - Engage domain experts to validate the practical relevance of proposed rule changes.

3. **Validation:**
   - Test the revised rules on a separate validation set to assess their generalizability.
   - Monitor both training and testing metrics to avoid overfitting.

By systematically addressing the limitations identified in the current iteration, the rules can be refined to achieve better performance, ultimately advancing the objectives of the research program.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Validation and Training Accuracies:**

Upon reviewing the previous and current validation accuracies, it's evident that there has been a decline in model performance:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies**: Consistently around **0.76**.
- **Previous Test Accuracies**: Varied between **0.625** and **0.75**.
- **Current Validation Accuracy**: Decreased to **0.6**.

The reduction from a validation accuracy of **0.76** to **0.6** indicates that the current set of rules is less effective in predicting the catalytic performance compared to previous iterations. This significant drop suggests that the model is not capturing the underlying patterns in the data as well as before.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

Given the decrease in both validation and (assumed) training accuracies, the model appears to be **underfitting** the data. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data, leading to poor performance on both training and validation sets. This suggests that the current rules may be too simplistic or insufficient to model the complex relationships between molecular features and catalytic outcomes.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions. Analyzing the SHAP values helps identify which rules are influencing the predictions, especially in cases where the model's predictions do not align with the experimental values.

**Overestimations (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

- **Molecule**: **C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=NC=C2)C(=O)O**
  - **Prediction**: High loading
  - **Experimental Value**: Low loading
  - **Key SHAP Contribution**:
    - **Rule 3 SHAP value**: **0.4827** (high positive contribution)

- **Molecule**: **C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F**
  - **Prediction**: High loading
  - **Experimental Value**: Low loading
  - **Key SHAP Contribution**:
    - **Rule 3 SHAP value**: **0.1701** (significant positive contribution)

In these cases, **Rule 3** is contributing significantly to the overprediction of high loading, as indicated by the high positive SHAP values.

**Underestimations (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

- **Molecule**: **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
  - **Prediction**: Low loading
  - **Experimental Value**: High loading
  - **Key SHAP Contribution**:
    - **Rule 3 SHAP value**: **-0.0444** (negative contribution)

- **Molecule**: **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**
  - **Prediction**: Low loading
  - **Experimental Value**: High loading
  - **Key SHAP Contribution**:
    - **Rule 3 SHAP value**: **-0.0216** (negative contribution)

Here, **Rule 3** is contributing negatively to the prediction of high loading, leading to underestimation.

**Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- **Rule 3 appears to be problematic**, as it contributes both high positive SHAP values in overestimations and high negative SHAP values in underestimations.
- The inconsistent impact of Rule 3 suggests that it may not accurately capture the relationship between the molecular features it represents and the catalytic performance.
- The **negative SHAP values** for Rule 3 in underestimations imply that the rule penalizes predictions of high loading, even when the experimental data indicates high loading.
- Conversely, the **positive SHAP values** for Rule 3 in overestimations imply that the rule strongly favors predictions of high loading, even when the experimental data shows low loading.

**Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

The current rules, particularly **Rule 3**, are **not effective enough** in accurately predicting the catalytic performance. The decline in validation accuracy and the discrepancies highlighted by the SHAP analysis indicate that the rules may be too generalized or misaligned with the actual chemical phenomena governing the catalyst-modifier interactions.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Rule 3**:

   - **Current Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination result in high yield.*
   - **Issues Identified**:
     - Rule 3 contributes to both overestimations and underestimations.
     - The broad definition may include molecules with varying coordination capabilities and electronic properties.
   - **Suggested Actions**:
     - **Narrow the Scope**: Specify the types of heterocycles and nitrogen configurations that truly contribute to high yield.
     - **Include Substituent Effects**: Consider the impact of substituents on the heterocycle that may affect coordination ability and electronic properties.
     - **Differentiate Between Heterocycles**: Recognize that not all nitrogen-containing heterocycles have the same coordination behavior.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations**:

   - Identify other rules that consistently contribute negative SHAP values in cases of underestimation.
   - **Rule 2** may also need refinement if it's contributing to incorrect predictions.
   - **Suggested Actions**:
     - Re-express these rules to better capture the conditions under which modifiers lead to high yield.
     - Incorporate additional chemical insights, such as steric factors or resonance effects.

3. **Improve Generalization**:

   - **Address Underfitting**: Enhance the complexity of the model by adding new rules or refining existing ones to capture more nuanced chemical interactions.
   - **Incorporate Additional Features**:
     - Consider physicochemical properties like pKa, log P, or electronic parameters.
     - Include descriptors related to molecular size, shape, or flexibility.

4. **Use Insights from SHAP Analysis Iteratively**:

   - **Iterative Refinement**: Use the SHAP values to guide which rules need adjustment but ensure changes are grounded in chemical rationale.
   - **Avoid Overfitting**: While refining the rules, be cautious not to tailor them too specifically to the current dataset.

5. **Validate Adjustments with Chemical Knowledge**:

   - Ensure that any modifications to rules are supported by chemical principles.
   - Consult literature or experimental data to confirm the validity of the proposed changes.

6. **Consider Rule Interactions**:

   - **Rule Combinations**: Some mispredictions may result from interactions between multiple rules.
   - **Suggested Actions**:
     - Investigate cases where multiple rules contribute contradictory SHAP values.
     - Develop composite rules or hierarchies to resolve conflicts.

7. **Expand the Dataset**:

   - **Additional Data**: Incorporate more experimental data to improve the robustness of the model.
   - **Diverse Molecules**: Include modifiers with a wider range of structural features to enhance the model's learning capacity.

8. **Re-evaluate Other Rules**:

   - While Rule 3 is a significant contributor to discrepancies, other rules may also need attention.
   - Systematically assess each rule's impact using SHAP values across the dataset.

**Summary of Proposed Rule Modification for Rule 3**:

- **Original Rule 3**: Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination result in high yield.
- **Refined Rule 3**:
  - **Option A**: *Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in specific positions (e.g., pyridine N-oxide) and lacking electron-withdrawing groups result in high yield.*
  - **Option B**: *Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids where the heterocycle is aromatic and the nitrogen atom is not hindered by adjacent substituents result in high yield.*

By refining Rule 3 to more accurately reflect the nuances of nitrogen coordination in heterocycles, the model may better differentiate between modifiers that truly contribute to high yield and those that do not.

**Conclusion:**

The current rules, specifically Rule 3, are contributing to decreased model performance due to overgeneralization or misrepresentation of chemical interactions. By carefully refining these rules based on both the SHAP analysis and chemical understanding, it is possible to improve the model's predictive accuracy and generalization. This process should be iterative, with continuous validation against experimental data to ensure that the rules remain aligned with the underlying chemistry.

---

**Note:** While SHAP analysis provides valuable insights into the contributions of each rule, it is essential to ground rule modifications in chemical logic to avoid overfitting and ensure the model's applicability to new data.

**Summary of the Discussions and Directions for Optimization:**

The current analysis of the rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction reveals several key points:

1. **Imbalance Between Precision and Coverage:**
   - **Increased Confidence and Lift:** The current rules show an increase in confidence and lift compared to previous iterations. This means that when the rules apply, they are more accurate in predicting high yields.
   - **Decreased Support and Leverage:** There is a significant reduction in support (the proportion of data the rules apply to) and leverage (the added value over random chance). This indicates that the rules cover fewer instances, limiting their practical utility.

2. **Decline in Validation Accuracy:**
   - The validation accuracy has dropped from around **76%** in previous iterations to **60%** currently. This suggests that the model is underfitting and not capturing the underlying patterns effectively.

3. **Issues Identified Through SHAP Analysis:**
   - **Rule 3** is problematic, as it contributes to both overestimations and underestimations of the yield. Its broad definition leads to inconsistent predictions.
   - Some rules have zero support in the training data (e.g., Rule 3), indicating they are not contributing meaningfully to the model.

4. **Potential Overfitting and Underfitting:**
   - While some rules may be overfitting to specific cases due to their strict conditions, others are underfitting by being too broad or not accurately capturing the chemical relationships.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Problematic Rules:**
   - **Rule 3 Refinement:**
     - **Issue:** Rule 3 currently states that modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination result in high yield. However, this is too broad and includes compounds that do not necessarily enhance yield.
     - **Action:** Narrow down the scope of Rule 3 to specify the types of heterocyclic compounds and nitrogen configurations that positively affect the yield. For example:
       - Focus on heterocycles where the nitrogen atoms are in positions that favor coordination without steric hindrance.
       - Exclude heterocycles with substituents that reduce coordination ability or introduce unfavorable electronic effects.
   - **Rule 1 Adjustment:**
     - **Issue:** Rule 1 currently shows a value of 1 across all molecules, indicating incorrect implementation.
     - **Action:** Correct the code to accurately identify molecules with multiple coordinating groups in proximity. Ensure proper use of SMARTS patterns and bond distance calculations to detect proximity.

2. **Expand Rule Coverage Without Sacrificing Confidence:**
   - **Increase Support:**
     - Modify rules to cover a larger portion of the dataset by relaxing overly strict conditions where appropriate.
     - Identify common features among high-yield modifiers that are not currently captured by existing rules.
   - **Balance Precision and Coverage:**
     - Adjust the specificity of rules to avoid overfitting to a small subset of data.
     - Ensure that rules maintain high confidence while being applicable to more instances.

3. **Enhance Rule Definitions with Chemical Insights:**
   - **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors:**
     - Utilize physicochemical properties such as pKa, log P, molecular size, and electronic parameters to refine the rules.
     - Consider the steric effects and electronic distribution within the molecules that influence metal coordination and catalytic activity.
   - **Differentiate Similar Functional Groups:**
     - Distinguish between functional groups that may have different effects despite being structurally similar (e.g., differentiating between various nitrogen-containing heterocycles).

4. **Verify and Correct Code Implementations:**
   - **SMARTS Pattern Accuracy:**
     - Ensure that SMARTS patterns used for identifying functional groups are accurate and specific.
     - Test patterns against known molecules to confirm they match the intended structures.
   - **Logic and Indentation:**
     - Review the code for any logical errors or misindentation that could affect the execution of rule conditions.
     - Implement unit tests for each rule to verify correct functioning.

5. **Remove or Revise Non-Contributing Rules:**
   - **Rule 3 Removal or Revision:**
     - Since Rule 3 has zero support, consider removing it or significantly revising it based on chemical reasoning and data analysis.
   - **Evaluate Other Low-Support Rules:**
     - Analyze rules with low support and confidence to determine if they should be refined or eliminated.

6. **Address Overlapping Rules and Conflicts:**
   - **Resolve Contradictory Predictions:**
     - Investigate cases where multiple rules provide conflicting SHAP values for the same molecule.
     - Develop a hierarchy or weighting system to prioritize rules based on their confidence and relevance.
   - **Composite Rules:**
     - Consider creating composite rules that combine conditions from multiple rules to improve predictive power.

7. **Iterative Model Improvement:**
   - **Continuous Evaluation:**
     - After making changes, re-evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation and SHAP analysis.
     - Ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data and do not overfit to the training set.
   - **Expert Consultation:**
     - Collaborate with domain experts to validate rule changes and ensure they align with chemical knowledge and experimental observations.

8. **Expand the Dataset:**
   - **Incorporate More Data:**
     - Include additional experimental results to provide a broader basis for rule development.
     - Gather data on modifiers with diverse structural features to enhance model robustness.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

Yes, there is a significant possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the existing rules based on chemical principles and data-driven insights, and by ensuring that the model remains generalizable, we can improve both the accuracy and applicability of the rules. The key is to find a balance between being specific enough to make accurate predictions and general enough to apply to a wide range of modifiers.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing multiple coordinating groups (e.g., carboxylate, amino, hydroxyl) in proximity result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The presence of multiple coordinating groups close to each other enhances the ability to chelate the metal center, improving catalyst efficiency through stronger and more stable metal-ligand complexes.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, strengthening its ability to coordinate with metal ions and enhancing catalytic activity through improved electron acceptance.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, forming strong complexes with metal centers and enhancing electron density at the metal ion, which improves catalytic reactivity.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the para position result in **low yield** unless they have additional functional groups capable of coordination.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Counterexample (High Yield)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening coordination with metal ions. However, additional coordinating groups like an amino group can compensate by providing alternative coordination sites.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with functional groups that interfere with metal coordination, such as aldehydes or perfluoroalkyl chains, result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or inhibit coordination, while perfluoroalkyl chains are strongly electron-withdrawing, reducing the electron density of the carboxylate and weakening metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long carbon chains (>6 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in **high yield**; the presence of distal functional groups may reduce yield.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Long-chain aliphatic acids without interfering groups coordinate effectively via the carboxyl group. Additional functional groups may not assist in coordination and could introduce steric hindrance or reduce solubility, affecting catalyst interaction.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with sulfur-containing groups in aliphatic chains result in **high yield** if the sulfur atom can coordinate without causing catalyst deactivation.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Sulfur atoms can act as soft ligands for metal coordination. When attached to aliphatic chains, they enhance coordination without poisoning the catalyst. In contrast, aromatic thiols may bind too strongly, blocking active sites.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole rings) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Side chains with heteroatoms provide additional coordination sites, forming more stable and active metal-ligand complexes, improving catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains or bulky substituents near coordinating groups result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced effective coordination.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Steric hindrance from bulky or flexible chains can impede the approach of the coordinating groups to the metal center, decreasing catalyst efficiency.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing keto groups adjacent to the carboxyl group in aliphatic chains result in **low yield** due to potential interference with coordination.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Keto groups near carboxyl groups may form intramolecular interactions or enolize, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for effective metal coordination.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups tend to result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Hydrophobic side chains without heteroatoms do not offer additional coordination sites, leading to weaker metal-ligand interactions and less effective catalysis.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl groups result in **variable yield**, influenced by their ability to form chelating rings with metal centers.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can facilitate chelation, but the overall molecular structure and additional substituents affect their coordination effectiveness and thus the yield.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate the relationships between structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By combining multiple substructures and considering physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, and steric factors, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in high or low yield.

**Summary of Key Insights:**

- **Coordination Enhancement**: Modifiers with multiple coordinating groups in close proximity (e.g., carboxylate, amino, hydroxyl, heterocyclic nitrogen) enhance metal-ligand interactions, leading to higher yields due to stronger and more stable catalyst complexes.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase carboxylate acidity and coordination strength, improving yield. Electron-donating groups can decrease coordination ability unless compensated by additional coordinating sites.

- **Steric and Structural Factors**: Modifiers with bulky substituents or flexible chains near coordinating groups hinder effective coordination, resulting in lower yields. The overall molecular geometry influences the ability to form stable chelates with the metal center.

- **Functional Group Interference**: Certain functional groups like aldehydes, perfluoroalkyl chains, or aromatic thiols may interfere with metal coordination or deactivate the catalyst, leading to low yields.

- **Position of Functional Groups**: The location of coordinating or interfering functional groups (e.g., sulfur atoms, hydroxyl groups) within the molecule affects their impact on the yield.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the potential effectiveness of new modifiers and inform the selection or design of molecular modifiers to optimize and control the reaction yield based on their structural characteristics.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Correct the Implementation of Rule 1**

  - **Issue**: Rule 1 incorrectly assigns a value of 1 across all molecules due to improper code implementation, failing to accurately identify molecules with multiple coordinating groups in proximity.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Revise SMARTS Patterns**: Update the SMARTS patterns to precisely detect coordinating groups such as carboxylate (`[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`), amino (`[NX3;H2,H1;!$(NC=O)]`), and hydroxyl (`[OX2H]`).
    - **Proximity Determination**: Implement a function to calculate the bond distance between coordinating groups. Use cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit) to determine if these groups are within a certain number of bonds (e.g., 2 or 3 bonds apart) to ensure they are in proximity for effective chelation.
    - **Logical Conditions**: Modify the rule's logic to require that at least two different coordinating groups are present and in proximity. This may involve counting occurrences and applying conditional statements that accurately reflect the rule's intent.
    - **Testing**: Validate the revised rule against known high-yield examples (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) to ensure correct identification, and confirm that it does not incorrectly classify low-yield modifiers.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rule 3 by Narrowing Its Scope**

  - **Issue**: Rule 3 is too broad, leading to inconsistent predictions and contributing to both overestimations and underestimations of yield. It currently has zero support in the training data.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Specify Nitrogen Positions**: Limit the rule to heterocyclic carboxylic acids where the nitrogen atom is in a position that enhances coordination with the metal center. For example, focus on pyridine carboxylic acids where the nitrogen is ortho or para to the carboxyl group, facilitating chelation.
    - **Exclude Certain Heterocycles**: Remove heterocycles that may hinder coordination due to steric factors or electronic effects, such as those with bulky substituents or electron-donating groups near the nitrogen.
    - **SMARTS Pattern Refinement**: Adjust the SMARTS patterns to match the specific heterocycles of interest more accurately. For instance, use `[nH]1ccncc1C(=O)[O-]` for pyridine-3-carboxylate structures.
    - **Include Positive Examples**: Ensure the rule encompasses known high-yield modifiers like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, while excluding irrelevant structures.
    - **Testing**: Reassess the rule against the dataset to confirm increased support and improved predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 3**: **Remove or Significantly Revise Rules with Zero Support**

  - **Issue**: Rules like the original Rule 3 are not contributing to the model due to zero support.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Evaluate Necessity**: If after refinement a rule still has minimal or zero support, consider removing it from the model to simplify and strengthen overall predictions.
    - **Develop New Rules**: Replace low-support rules with new ones derived from patterns observed in the data. For example, identify other functional groups or structural motifs prevalent in high-yield modifiers that are currently unaccounted for.

- **Advice 4**: **Expand Rule Coverage by Identifying Common Features**

  - **Action**:
    - **Data Analysis**: Perform clustering or association analysis on high-yield modifiers to find common substructures or properties not covered by existing rules.
    - **Incorporate Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Develop new rules that include modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups in positions that enhance metal coordination, beyond those already specified.
    - **Consider Chain Length and Saturation**: Introduce rules accounting for the influence of aliphatic chain length and saturation on yield, as observed with octanoic acid (high yield).

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance Rule Definitions with Additional Molecular Descriptors**

  - **Action**:
    - **Include Physicochemical Properties**: Integrate parameters such as pKa, log P (octanol-water partition coefficient), and molecular weight into the rules to better predict coordination ability and solubility factors affecting yield.
    - **Set Thresholds**: Establish specific ranges for these properties that correlate with high yield based on statistical analysis.
    - **Combine Structural and Property-Based Criteria**: Create multifaceted rules that consider both the presence of certain functional groups and their physicochemical contexts.

- **Advice 6**: **Verify and Correct Code Implementations**

  - **Action**:
    - **SMARTS Pattern Accuracy**: Review all SMARTS patterns used in the rules for correctness. Ensure they unambiguously match the intended functional groups without false positives.
    - **Logical Consistency**: Check the logic and code structure for each rule, correcting any misindentations or syntax errors that could lead to improper execution.
    - **Unit Testing**: Develop and run unit tests for each rule using molecules with known outcomes to validate their performance individually before combining them into the model.

- **Advice 7**: **Address Overlapping Rules and Conflicts**

  - **Action**:
    - **Conflict Resolution Strategy**: Establish a hierarchy or weighting system where rules with higher confidence and support take precedence in cases of conflicting predictions.
    - **Rule Integration**: Where appropriate, merge overlapping rules into a single, more comprehensive rule that captures the essential features influencing yield.
    - **Transparency in Rule Application**: Document the decision criteria used when multiple rules apply to enhance interpretability and consistency.

- **Advice 8**: **Re-evaluate Model Performance After Refinements**

  - **Action**:
    - **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the updated model's performance on unseen data, ensuring that improvements are generalizable.
    - **SHAP Analysis**: Perform SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis again to identify the impact of each rule on the predictions and confirm that the adjustments have mitigated previous issues.
    - **Iterative Refinement**: Be prepared to iterate on the rules, making further adjustments based on evaluation results to optimize the balance between accuracy and coverage without overfitting.

**End of Advice**
---------------------------------------------------------------

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (≥8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Long-chain aliphatic acids coordinate effectively via the carboxyl group without interference from other functional groups. Their hydrophobic nature may also promote better interaction with the catalyst's hydrophobic regions.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl or amino groups on the carbon chain result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Additional polar functional groups can interfere with metal coordination or introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of the catalyst modifier interaction.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde or keto groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Carbonyl groups near the carboxylate can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or engage in side reactions, hindering the ability of the carboxylate to effectively coordinate with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heterocycles (e.g., indole ring) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Heterocyclic side chains with nitrogen atoms provide additional coordination sites, forming strong metal-ligand complexes that enhance catalyst stability and activity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky or flexible polyether chains near the coordinating group result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Steric bulk and chain flexibility can impede the approach and binding of the carboxylate group to the metal center, reducing the effectiveness of coordination and catalysis.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing sulfur atoms in aliphatic chains that can serve as coordinating sites result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Sulfur atoms act as soft Lewis bases and can form strong bonds with metal ions, providing additional coordination that enhances the catalytic activity of the metal center.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Hydrophobic side chains without coordinating groups do not contribute to metal binding, resulting in weaker overall coordination and decreased catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in **high yield** due to multiple coordination possibilities.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional hydrogen bonding and coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl groups capable of chelation result in **variable yield**, influenced by overall molecular structure and steric factors.**

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can form chelating rings with metal ions, potentially enhancing coordination. However, other substituents and steric hindrance can influence the effectiveness of this interaction, leading to variable yields.

**End of Rules**

These rules capture the relationships between specific structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering combinations of functional groups and underlying physicochemical properties, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in high or low yield:

- **Coordination Enhancement**: Modifiers with multiple or strong coordinating groups (e.g., carboxylate, amino, heterocyclic nitrogen or sulfur atoms) increase the coordination with metal centers, leading to higher yields.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of carboxylate groups, improving catalyst performance. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect, reducing yield.

- **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents or flexible chains near coordinating groups can hinder effective metal-ligand interactions, resulting in lower yields due to decreased coordination efficiency.

- **Functional Group Interference**: Functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, or perfluoroalkyl chains can interfere with metal coordination or alter electronic properties, leading to lower yields.

- **Hydrophobicity and Coordination Sites**: Modifiers lacking coordinating heteroatoms in their side chains or those with hydrophobic residues without additional coordination capabilities generally result in lower yields due to weaker metal interactions.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the potential effectiveness of new modifiers based on their structural characteristics. This enables the selection or design of molecular modifiers to optimize and control the reaction yield, facilitating more efficient catalyst development.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows us to predict high yield modifiers when they are aliphatic amino dicarboxylic acids. The property insight is strong, explaining how multiple coordination points enhance catalyst efficiency through strong chelation. The rule considers combinations of functional groups (amino and dicarboxylic acid), fulfilling the complexity criterion. With at least three supporting data points, the coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in high yield. The property insight is solid, explaining increased acidity and stronger coordination with metal ions. The rule combines sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxyl group, electron-withdrawing substituent), satisfying the complexity requirement. Coverage is acceptable with two supporting data points.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** effectively predicts low yield for aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position. The clarity is high, and the property insight explains how electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken metal-ligand coordination. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage is supported by at least two data points.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear in identifying high yield modifiers as heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination. The property insight is strong, highlighting how nitrogen atoms enhance electron density at the metal ion. The rule addresses complexity by considering heterocycles with specific coordinating atoms. Coverage includes two data points, which is acceptable.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (≥8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in high yield. While the rule is clear, the coverage is limited to a single data point (octanoic acid), which doesn't fully meet the coverage criterion requiring at least two data points. The property insight is reasonable but would benefit from more data support.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** clearly indicates that aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl or amino groups on the carbon chain result in low yield. The property insight is strong, explaining how additional polar groups interfere with metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, satisfying the complexity requirement. Coverage is robust with at least three supporting data points.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** predicts low yield for modifiers containing aldehyde or keto groups adjacent to the carboxyl group. The clarity is high, and the property insight is solid, explaining hindrance in coordination due to intramolecular interactions. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, fulfilling the complexity criterion. Coverage is sufficient with three data points.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly states that modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains result in low yield due to electron-withdrawing effects reducing coordination ability. The property insight is logical. However, coverage is limited to a single data point, which does not fully satisfy the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** indicates that amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heterocycles result in high yield. The property insight is sound, highlighting additional coordination sites enhancing catalyst activity. Coverage is limited to one example (tryptophan), not fully meeting the required coverage.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** predicts low yield due to steric hindrance from bulky or flexible polyether chains near the coordinating group. The clarity is high, and the property insight is acceptable. However, coverage is limited to a single data point, which doesn't fully meet the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** states that modifiers containing sulfur atoms in aliphatic chains result in high yield. The property insight is valid, explaining how sulfur atoms form strong bonds with metal ions. Coverage is limited to one data point, insufficient to fully satisfy the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** clearly predicts low yield for amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms. The property insight is logical, noting the lack of contribution to metal binding. However, coverage is limited to one example (phenylalanine), which is below the desired level.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** suggests that polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in high yield due to multiple coordination possibilities. The property insight is sound, but coverage is limited to one data point (gluconic acid), not fully satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** acknowledges that modifiers with ortho-hydroxyl groups capable of chelation result in variable yield influenced by molecular structure and steric factors. The property insight addresses the complexity of interactions, and coverage includes at least two data points with differing outcomes, meeting the coverage criterion.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino dicarboxylic acids result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an amino group allows for multiple coordination points with the metal center, enhancing catalyst efficiency through strong chelation and stabilization of the active site.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halomethyl) at the para position result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, strengthening its ability to coordinate with metal ions and enhancing catalytic activity through improved electron acceptance at the metal center.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the para position result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal-ligand coordination. This reduction in coordination strength leads to less effective catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as strong coordinating sites, forming stable complexes with metal centers. This additional coordination enhances electron density at the metal ion, improving catalytic reactivity.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (≥8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Long-chain aliphatic acids coordinate effectively via the carboxyl group without interference from other functional groups. Their hydrophobic nature may also promote better interaction with the catalyst's hydrophobic regions.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl or amino groups on the carbon chain result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Additional polar functional groups can interfere with metal coordination or introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of the catalyst modifier interaction.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde or keto groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Carbonyl groups near the carboxylate can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or engage in side reactions, hindering the ability of the carboxylate to effectively coordinate with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of perfluoroalkyl groups reduces the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its coordination ability with metal ions and diminishing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heterocycles (e.g., indole ring) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Heterocyclic side chains with nitrogen atoms provide additional coordination sites, forming strong metal-ligand complexes that enhance catalyst stability and activity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky or flexible polyether chains near the coordinating group result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Steric bulk and chain flexibility can impede the approach and binding of the carboxylate group to the metal center, reducing the effectiveness of coordination and catalysis.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing sulfur atoms in aliphatic chains that can serve as coordinating sites result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Sulfur atoms act as soft Lewis bases and can form strong bonds with metal ions, providing additional coordination that enhances the catalytic activity of the metal center.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Hydrophobic side chains without coordinating groups do not contribute to metal binding, resulting in weaker overall coordination and decreased catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in **high yield** due to multiple coordination possibilities.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional hydrogen bonding and coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl groups capable of chelation result in **variable yield**, influenced by overall molecular structure and steric factors.**

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can form chelating rings with metal ions, potentially enhancing coordination. However, other substituents and steric hindrance can influence the effectiveness of this interaction, leading to variable yields.

- **Hydrophobicity and Coordination Sites**: Modifiers lacking coordinating heteroatoms in their side chains or those with hydrophobic residues without additional coordination capabilities generally result in lower yields due to weaker metal interactions.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the potential effectiveness of new modifiers based on their structural characteristics. This enables the selection or design of molecular modifiers to optimize and control the reaction yield, facilitating more efficient catalyst development.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
After carefully reviewing the code and the resulting feature matrix, I have found that the transformation from the language rules to the numeric feature matrix is not fully effective. There are several discrepancies between the rules and their implementation in the code, which affect the accuracy of the feature matrix.

**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct the SMARTS pattern for the dicarboxylic acid in Rule 1**
  
  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern for the dicarboxylic acid in Rule 1 is incorrect. The pattern `"[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]"` uses `[CX2]`, which represents an sp-hybridized carbon (found in alkynes), not an sp³-hybridized carbon present in aliphatic chains.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Replace `[CX2]` with `[CX4]` to represent a saturated carbon atom in the aliphatic chain. The corrected SMARTS pattern should be `"[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]"`.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Modify the SMARTS pattern for the aliphatic amino group in Rule 1 to ensure correct connectivity**
  
  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern for the aliphatic amino group `"[NX3;H2][CX4]"` does not ensure that the amino group is connected to the same carbon chain as the two carboxylic groups.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Create a single SMARTS pattern that captures the entire structure of aliphatic amino dicarboxylic acids. For example, `"[NX3;H2][CX4;!$(C=O)]([CX4])[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]"` ensures that the amino group is connected to the alpha carbon of the dicarboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Adjust the pattern for Rule 2 to ensure the EWG is at the para position**
  
  - **Issue**: In Rule 2, the pattern `"[c][c][c][c]([c][c])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]"` does not specifically check for the EWG at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Use a more specific SMARTS pattern that defines the para position. For example, `"[c]1[c][c][c]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[c][c]1"` ensures an aromatic carboxylic acid with substitution at the para position. Then, check for the presence of strong EWG groups at that position using the SMARTS patterns for nitro `"[NX3](=O)=O"` or halomethyl `"[CH2][Hal]"`.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Ensure that Rule 2 correctly combines the patterns for the aromatic ring and the EWG**
  
  - **Issue**: The code currently treats the detection of the aromatic carboxylic acid and the EWG independently, which may not correctly match the intended structures.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Modify the code to first identify the para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acid and then check if the para substituent matches the strong EWG patterns. This can be done by using the `GetSubstructMatches()` function to find the substitution position and verify the substituent.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Improve the EDG detection in Rule 3 by refining the SMARTS patterns**
  
  - **Issue**: The electron-donating group (EDG) patterns in Rule 3 are too general and may not accurately detect all EDGs at the para position.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Expand the EDG patterns to include other common EDGs, such as methyl (`"[CH3]"`), methoxy (`"[OX2][CH3]"`), and amino (`"[NX3;H2,H1][CX4]"`). Also, ensure that these groups are detected specifically at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid on the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Correct the pattern for heterocyclic carboxylic acids in Rule 4**
  
  - **Issue**: The SMARTS pattern for heterocyclic carboxylic acids `"[nH1,c][c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]"` may not accurately capture the heterocycles described in the rule.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Use a more general pattern that matches five- or six-membered heterocycles containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination. For example, `"[n][aromatic_ring][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]"`, where `aromatic_ring` is a placeholder for the rest of the ring structure.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Update Rule 5 to match aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of ≥8 carbons**
  
  - **Issue**: The pattern for Rule 5 only matches octanoic acid and may not detect other long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with eight or more carbons.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Use a recursive SMARTS pattern to match aliphatic chains with eight or more carbons. For example, `"[CX4H2][CX4H2]{6,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]"` matches aliphatic chains with six or more repeating `CH2` units, ensuring a total chain length of at least eight carbons.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Refine the patterns for detecting hydroxyl or amino groups on aliphatic chains in Rule 6**
  
  - **Issue**: The current patterns may not effectively detect hydroxyl or amino groups present on the aliphatic chain.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Use SMARTS patterns that specify the hydroxyl or amino groups attached to the aliphatic chain. For example, `"[CX4][CX4][OX2H]"` for a hydroxyl group two carbons away from the carboxylic acid, and `"[CX4][CX4][NX3;H2,H1]"` for an amino group in a similar position.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Correct the patterns for aldehyde and keto groups adjacent to the carboxyl group in Rule 7**
  
  - **Issue**: The patterns `"[CX3](=O)[CX3H1](=O)"` and `"[CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)"` may not accurately detect aldehyde or keto groups adjacent to the carboxyl group.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Use SMARTS patterns that represent aldehyde or ketone groups next to the carboxyl group. For aldehydes, `"[CX3](=O)[CX3H](=O)"`, and for ketones, `"[CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)"`.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Enhance the pattern for perfluoroalkyl chains in Rule 8**
  
  - **Issue**: The pattern `"[CX4]([F,Cl,Br,I])([F,Cl,Br,I])[F,Cl,Br,I]"` only matches trifluoromethyl groups and may not detect longer perfluoroalkyl chains.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Use a recursive SMARTS pattern to match perfluoroalkyl chains of varying lengths. For example, `"[CX4]([CX4](F)(F)F)(F)(F)F"` or `"[CX4](F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)F"` to match longer perfluoroalkyl chains.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Adjust the amino acid pattern in Rule 9 to include side chains with coordinating heterocycles**
  
  - **Issue**: The pattern for the amino acid backbone does not ensure the presence of a coordinating heterocyclic side chain.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Modify the pattern to include side chains with heterocycles, such as indole. For example, use `"[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX3](=[CX3])[c]"` to capture amino acids like tryptophan.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Clarify the polyether chain pattern in Rule 10**
  
  - **Issue**: The pattern `"[CX4][OX2][CX4]{2,}"` may not correctly detect polyether chains with two or more ether linkages near the coordinating group.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Use a more precise recursive pattern, such as `"(OCC){2,}"`, to detect two or more repeating `-O-CH2-CH2-` units. Ensure that this pattern is near the coordinating group, e.g., `"[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4](OCC){2,}"`.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Refine the hydrophobic side chain pattern in Rule 12**
  
  - **Issue**: The pattern `"[CX4][c]"` may not accurately detect hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Use patterns that specifically target amino acids with hydrophobic side chains, such as phenylalanine, leucine, or isoleucine. For example, `"[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX4][c]"` for side chains leading to an aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Improve the pattern for polyhydroxylated acids in Rule 13**
  
  - **Issue**: The pattern `"[OX2H][CX4]{3,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]"` may not effectively match polyhydroxylated acids like gluconic acid.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Use a recursive pattern that matches multiple hydroxyl groups on the aliphatic chain. For example, `"[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]"`, which matches a chain with at least three hydroxylated carbons.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Clarify the variable yield in Rule 14 by handling exceptions**
  
  - **Issue**: Rule 14 mentions variable yield influenced by molecular structure and steric factors, but the code currently treats it as a single pattern with prediction `0`.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Implement additional logic to consider steric factors and other substituents that might influence the yield. This could involve calculating molecular descriptors or using more advanced pattern matching to assess the likelihood of high or low yield.

- **Suggestion 16**: **General Improvement - Use RDKit's chemical features and descriptors**
  
  - **Issue**: Many of the rules require more nuanced understanding of molecular features that simple SMARTS patterns may not capture.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Incorporate RDKit's chemical feature factories or molecular descriptors to assess properties like electronic effects, steric hindrance, and coordination sites. This will improve the accuracy of rule matching by considering the chemical context beyond substructure patterns.

- **Suggestion 17**: **Add error handling and logging for better debugging**
  
  - **Issue**: The code does not provide detailed feedback if a SMARTS pattern fails or if a molecule cannot be parsed.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Implement try-except blocks around the SMARTS compilation and substructure matching steps, logging any errors with informative messages. This will aid in troubleshooting and ensure that all molecules are processed correctly.

- **Suggestion 18**: **Verify the mapping between SMILES indices and the feature matrix**
  
  - **Issue**: It's crucial to ensure that the order of SMILES in the list corresponds precisely to the rows in the feature matrix.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Use unique identifiers or indices when processing the SMILES list and generating the feature matrix. Consider returning the SMILES strings along with the feature matrix for easier cross-referencing and validation.

- **Suggestion 19**: **Test the updated code with known examples**
  
  - **Issue**: Without testing, it's unclear whether the suggested code changes will produce the desired results.
  
  - **Suggestion**: After implementing the corrections, test the code using the provided examples for each rule to ensure that the feature matrix correctly reflects the expected high or low yield predictions.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino dicarboxylic acids result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an amino group allows for multiple coordination points with the metal center, enhancing catalyst efficiency through strong chelation and stabilization of the active site.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halomethyl) at the para position result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, strengthening its ability to coordinate with metal ions and enhancing catalytic activity through improved electron acceptance at the metal center.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the para position result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal-ligand coordination. This reduction in coordination strength leads to less effective catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination result in **high yield**.**

  - **Examples (High Yield)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as strong coordinating sites, forming stable complexes with metal centers. This additional coordination enhances electron density at the metal ion, improving catalytic reactivity.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (≥8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Long-chain aliphatic acids coordinate effectively via the carboxyl group without interference from other functional groups. Their hydrophobic nature may also promote better interaction with the catalyst's hydrophobic regions.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl or amino groups on the carbon chain result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Additional polar functional groups can interfere with metal coordination or introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of the catalyst modifier interaction.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde or keto groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.**

  - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Carbonyl groups near the carboxylate can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or engage in side reactions, hindering the ability of the carboxylate to effectively coordinate with the metal center.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of perfluoroalkyl groups reduces the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its coordination ability with metal ions and diminishing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heterocycles (e.g., indole ring) result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Heterocyclic side chains with nitrogen atoms provide additional coordination sites, forming strong metal-ligand complexes that enhance catalyst stability and activity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky or flexible polyether chains near the coordinating group result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Steric bulk and chain flexibility can impede the approach and binding of the carboxylate group to the metal center, reducing the effectiveness of coordination and catalysis.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing sulfur atoms in aliphatic chains that can serve as coordinating sites result in **high yield**.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Sulfur atoms act as soft Lewis bases and can form strong bonds with metal ions, providing additional coordination that enhances the catalytic activity of the metal center.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in **low yield**.**

  - **Example (Low Yield)**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **Rationale**: Hydrophobic side chains without coordinating groups do not contribute to metal binding, resulting in weaker overall coordination and decreased catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in **high yield** due to multiple coordination possibilities.**

  - **Example (High Yield)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional hydrogen bonding and coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl groups capable of chelation result in **variable yield**, influenced by overall molecular structure and steric factors.**

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can form chelating rings with metal ions, potentially enhancing coordination. However, other substituents and steric hindrance can influence the effectiveness of this interaction, leading to variable yields.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules capture the relationships between specific structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering combinations of functional groups and underlying physicochemical properties, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in high or low yield:

- **Coordination Enhancement**: Modifiers with multiple or strong coordinating groups (e.g., carboxylate, amino, heterocyclic nitrogen or sulfur atoms) increase the coordination with metal centers, leading to higher yields.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of carboxylate groups, improving catalyst performance. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect, reducing yield.

- **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents or flexible chains near coordinating groups can hinder effective metal-ligand interactions, resulting in lower yields due to decreased coordination efficiency.

- **Functional Group Interference**: Functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, or perfluoroalkyl chains can interfere with metal coordination or alter electronic properties, leading to lower yields.

- **Hydrophobicity and Coordination Sites**: Modifiers lacking coordinating heteroatoms in their side chains or those with hydrophobic residues without additional coordination capabilities generally result in lower yields due to weaker metal interactions.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the potential effectiveness of new modifiers based on their structural characteristics. This enables the selection or design of molecular modifiers to optimize and control the reaction yield, facilitating more efficient catalyst development.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Adjust the code for Rule 2 to correctly match modifiers with either a nitro group *or* a halomethyl group at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.** Modify the 'include' list to only require the carboxylic acid pattern and use an 'either' clause for the electron-withdrawing groups. Additionally, update the SMARTS patterns to specify the para position on the aromatic ring. For example, use a SMARTS pattern that defines the carboxylic acid and the substituent in para positions relative to each other.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Revise the code for Rule 3 to detect electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids.** Similar to Rule 2, adjust the 'include' list to require only the carboxylic acid attached to an aromatic ring and use an 'either' clause for methyl or methoxy groups. Incorporate positional specificity into the SMARTS patterns to ensure that the methyl or methoxy group is at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Implement positional specificity in SMARTS patterns for aromatic substituents.** Use more complex SMARTS patterns or recursive SMARTS to accurately identify substituents at specific positions (ortho, meta, para) on the aromatic ring with respect to the carboxyl group. This will improve the accuracy of matching modifiers based on the position of functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Correct the logical structure for rules requiring either/or conditions.** For rules where modifiers may have one of several functional groups (e.g., either a nitro group *or* a halomethyl group), use an 'either' key in the rule dictionary to specify that only one of the patterns needs to be matched. Ensure that the code checks this condition correctly during pattern matching.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Enhance the SMARTS patterns to consider the full context of functional groups.** For example, in Rule 6, ensure that hydroxyl or amino groups are on aliphatic chains and not part of aromatic systems or elsewhere. This may involve refining patterns to include the carbon chain context and exclude undesired matches.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Expand the SMARTS pattern for perfluoroalkyl chains in Rule 8.** The current pattern matches only trifluoromethyl groups. Update it to capture longer perfluoroalkyl chains by using a pattern like '[CX4][CX2](F)(F)(F)', which can be extended to include multiple CF2 units to represent perfluoroalkyl chains more generally.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Verify and adjust the code for Rule 9 to accurately match amino acids with coordinating heterocycles like indole rings.** Ensure that the SMARTS patterns correctly identify the connection between the amino acid backbone and the heterocyclic side chain. This may involve creating more specific patterns that reflect the typical structures of such amino acids (e.g., tryptophan).

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Improve the patterns for bulky or flexible polyether chains in Rule 10.** Adjust the SMARTS pattern to capture polyether chains near the coordinating group more effectively and consider the proximity to the carboxyl group. This might involve specifying the distance between the polyether chain and the coordinating site.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for sulfur atoms in aliphatic chains in Rule 11.** Ensure that the pattern matches sulfur atoms capable of coordination within the chain (e.g., thiols and thioethers) and that the sulfur is properly connected within an aliphatic context.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Conduct thorough testing with known examples for each rule to validate the SMARTS patterns and matching logic.** Use both positive and negative control compounds to ensure that the code accurately identifies modifiers that should match each rule and does not produce false positives or negatives. Adjust the patterns and logic based on the test results.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Reformulate the existing rules using SMARTS patterns or SMILES-based descriptors to enable automatic generation of numerical features.** By translating structural features into specific substructure patterns recognizable in SMILES notation, we can create binary or count-based descriptors that facilitate quantitative analysis and machine learning model development. This addresses the difficulty in generating a numeric feature matrix from the current rules.

- **Advice 2**: **Revise Rule 3 to differentiate between types of electron-donating groups, specifically addressing amino groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids.** While amino groups are electron-donating, they can also act as coordinating sites with metal centers. Modify the rule to reflect that para-amino substituents may result in high yield due to their ability to enhance coordination, contrary to other electron-donating groups like methyl or methoxy that decrease yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rule 6 by incorporating the positional influence of hydroxyl and amino groups on aliphatic chains.** Recognize that amino or hydroxyl groups located further from the carboxyl group (e.g., at the ω-position) may not adversely affect yield. Adjust the rule to specify that only proximal (α or β) substitutions interfere with metal coordination, while distal substitutions may allow for high yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Introduce a new rule to account for modifiers with multiple functional groups that collectively enhance coordination, even if individual groups are electron-donating.** For example, compounds like **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** result in high yield despite containing electron-donating groups. This suggests the need to consider the synergistic effects of additional coordinating groups or overall molecular conformation that promote effective interaction with the metal center.

- **Advice 5**: **Modify Rule 11 to consider steric hindrance and electronic context in sulfur-containing modifiers.** While sulfur atoms can enhance coordination, the surrounding molecular environment may diminish this effect. Incorporate considerations of steric bulk or electron-withdrawing/donating effects near the sulfur atom that could lead to lower yields, ensuring the rule accurately predicts outcomes across different compounds.

- **Advice 6**: **Integrate quantitative descriptors related to electronic and steric properties into the rules.** Utilize parameters such as Hammett sigma constants for substituent electron-withdrawing or donating effects, Taft steric parameters, and calculated partial charges. This quantitative approach aids in transforming the rules into numerical features suitable for modeling and reflects the nuanced influence of substituents on yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Develop a systematic classification system for modifiers based on key structural features influencing yield.** Create categories defined by the presence and position of coordinating heteroatoms (N, O, S), the type of functional groups (carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl, carbonyl), chain length, and aromaticity. This structured framework enhances the clarity of the rules and supports the generation of numerical descriptors from SMILES data.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate exceptions and boundary cases into the rules with specific conditions.** For each rule, provide clear criteria that include known exceptions from the dataset. For instance, specify that although electron-donating groups generally decrease yield, para-amino groups are an exception due to their coordination ability. This precision improves the accuracy and reliability of the rules.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  Rule 1 is **clear**, allowing for straightforward determination of high yield modifiers based on the presence of both an amino group and at least one carboxylic acid group attached to an aliphatic chain of up to 6 carbons. The **property insight** is adequate, explaining how multiple coordination sites enhance catalyst efficiency through strong chelation. The rule considers a **combination of sub-structures** (amino group and carboxylate on a short aliphatic chain), satisfying the **complexity** criterion. With at least **four supporting data points** (entries 0, 2, 3, 15) showing high yield, the **coverage** is strong. Overall, Rule 1 effectively meets all criteria.

- **Comment 2**:

  Rule 2 is **clear** in specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in high yield. The **property insight** about increased acidity enhancing coordination is sound. The rule combines an aromatic ring, carboxylate group, and specific substituents, meeting the **complexity** requirement. However, the **coverage** is limited to **two data points** (entries 1 and 21). Additionally, the presence of 4-formylbenzoic acid (entry 20) with a low yield suggests a potential **contradiction**, as the formyl group is electron-withdrawing. This indicates that the rule may need refinement to account for exceptions and improve its applicability.

- **Comment 3**:

  Rule 3 provides **clarity** by indicating that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position result in low yield. The **property insight** regarding decreased acidity and weakened coordination is appropriate. The rule considers both the aromatic structure and substituent effects, fulfilling the **complexity** criterion. It is supported by at least **two data points** (entries 23 and 30) showing low yield. However, entry 7 (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) shows a **high yield**, which contradicts the rule despite having a para-hydroxy group. This suggests that the **coverage** may not fully capture all relevant cases, and the rule may require adjustments to address such exceptions.

- **Comment 4**:

  Rule 4 is **clear**, stating that heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring result in high yield. The **property insight** about nitrogen atoms enhancing coordination is relevant. The rule combines heterocyclic structures with functional groups, satisfying **complexity**. It is supported by **two data points** (entries 16 and 22) showing high yield. However, entry 12 (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) has a **low yield**, which may be a contradiction if it fits the structural description of the rule. This indicates that the **coverage** may be insufficient, and the rule might need refinement to improve its predictive accuracy.

- **Comment 5**:

  Rule 5 offers **clarity** by specifying that amino acids with side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in low yield. The **property insight** regarding weaker coordination due to lack of coordinating groups is sound. The rule focuses on side chain properties, demonstrating **complexity**. It is supported by **multiple data points** (entries 13 and 33) showing low yield, indicating good **coverage**. There are no apparent contradictions, so Rule 5 effectively meets all criteria.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 is **clear** in stating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group result in high yield. The **property insight** about thiol groups forming strong bonds with metal ions is valid. The rule combines functional groups, meeting **complexity**. However, it is supported by only **one data point** (entry 18), which limits its **coverage**. To strengthen the rule, additional supporting data would be beneficial.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 maintains **clarity** by indicating that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in low yield. The **property insight** concerning functional group interference is appropriate. The rule considers the positioning of functional groups, fulfilling **complexity**. It is supported by **two data points** (entries 20 and 27) with low yield, demonstrating adequate **coverage**. Rule 7 meets the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 8**:

  Rule 8 is **clear**, stating that perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in low yield. The **property insight** about electron-withdrawing effects reducing coordination ability is relevant. The rule is relatively simple and may lack **complexity** in terms of combining sub-structures. It is supported by only **one data point** (entry 14), so the **coverage** is limited. Additional examples would enhance the robustness of the rule.

- **Comment 9**:

  Rule 9 provides **clarity** by specifying that polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in high yield. The **property insight** about multiple hydroxyl groups enhancing coordination is sound. The rule considers multiple functional groups, meeting **complexity**. However, with only **one supporting data point** (entry 9), the **coverage** is insufficient. More data are needed to validate this rule fully.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 is **clear** in stating that modifiers with remote amino or hydroxyl groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance. The **property insight** is appropriate. The rule considers the spatial arrangement of functional groups, satisfying **complexity**. It is supported by **multiple data points** (entries 29, 31, 34) showing low yield, indicating strong **coverage**. Rule 10 meets all the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 11**:

  Rule 11 maintains **clarity** by indicating that bulky substituents near the carboxyl group result in low yield. The **property insight** about steric hindrance affecting coordination is valid. The rule considers steric effects and functional group positioning, demonstrating **complexity**. However, it is supported by only **one data point** (entry 11), which limits its **coverage**. Additional supporting data would strengthen the rule's validity.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Revise Rule 2 to Account for Functional Group Interference**

  Modify Rule 2 to specify that while aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position generally result in high yield, certain electron-withdrawing groups like aldehydes (e.g., formyl groups) may interfere with metal coordination due to additional reactivity or steric factors. For example, 4-formylbenzoic acid shows low yield despite having an electron-withdrawing group. Update the rule to exclude such functional groups or create a separate rule addressing them.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rule 3 to Include Compensatory Coordination Effects**

  Adjust Rule 3 to acknowledge that electron-donating groups at the para position typically lead to low yield but can be offset by additional coordinating groups elsewhere in the molecule. For instance, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid exhibits high yield despite a para-hydroxy group because the hydroxyl group may provide extra coordination sites. Modify the rule to consider the presence of other functional groups that enhance coordination.

- **Advice 3**: **Clarify Rule 4 to Address Positional and Steric Factors**

  Refine Rule 4 by specifying that the position of nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic carboxylic acids affects yield. Not all nitrogen-containing heterocycles guarantee high yield; steric hindrance or electronic factors can reduce effectiveness. For example, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid results in low yield, possibly due to steric hindrance or ineffective nitrogen coordination. Update the rule to consider the impact of nitrogen atom positioning and overall molecular geometry.

- **Advice 4**: **Expand Data Coverage for Rules with Limited Support**

  For rules supported by only one data point (e.g., Rules 6, 8, 9, and 11), gather additional experimental data to strengthen their validity. This could involve testing more modifiers containing thiol groups (Rule 6), perfluoroalkyl chains (Rule 8), polyhydroxylated chains (Rule 9), and bulky substituents near carboxyl groups (Rule 11). Ensuring each rule is backed by multiple examples enhances robustness and reliability.

- **Advice 5**: **Integrate Chain Length Considerations into Rule 5**

  Enhance Rule 5 by incorporating the effect of side-chain length and hydrophobicity on yield. Recognize that longer hydrophobic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms not only lack coordination but may also introduce steric hindrance or reduce solubility, further decreasing catalyst performance. Adjust the rule to include these factors for a more comprehensive guideline.

- **Advice 6**: **Consolidate Rules Related to Steric Hindrance**

  Combine Rules 5, 10, and 11 into a unified rule that addresses how steric hindrance from bulky or remote functional groups negatively impacts yield. This new rule should cover modifiers with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating atoms, remote amino or hydroxyl groups, and bulky substituents near the carboxyl group, all of which reduce effective metal-ligand interactions.

- **Advice 7**: **Introduce a Rule for Functional Groups Forming Intramolecular Interactions**

  Create a new rule to address modifiers with functional groups capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds or chelates (e.g., ortho-hydroxyl groups). These interactions can either enhance or hinder coordination with the metal center, leading to variable yields. Providing criteria for when such functional groups result in high or low yield will improve predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 8**: **Explicitly Address Catalyst Deactivating Groups**

  Add a rule that considers modifiers containing functional groups known to deactivate or poison catalysts (e.g., strong chelating ligands or groups that irreversibly bind to the metal center). This rule should identify such groups and predict low yield outcomes, assisting in the avoidance of modifiers that could impair catalyst function.

- **Advice 9**: **Include Exceptions and Contextual Factors Within Rules**

  For each rule, note any known exceptions or contextual factors that influence the outcome. This could involve specifying conditions under which a rule does not apply or highlighting molecular features that override the general trend. Providing this information will help prevent misclassification and guide more nuanced decision-making.

- **Advice 10**: **Ensure Rules are Supported by Multiple Data Points**

  Before finalizing rules, verify that each is supported by at least two data points to satisfy the coverage criterion. If insufficient data exist, consider marking the rule as tentative until further experimental validation can be conducted. This practice enhances the credibility of the rules and their utility in predicting reaction outcomes.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

1. **Modifiers containing both an amino group and at least one carboxylic acid group attached to an aliphatic chain of up to 6 carbons result in **high yield**.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

   - **Rationale**: The presence of an amino group and carboxylate(s) allows for multiple coordination sites with the metal center. This enhances catalyst efficiency through strong chelation and stabilization of the active site.

---

2. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in **high yield**.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, strengthening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. This enhances catalytic activity through improved electron acceptance at the metal center.

---

3. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the para position result in **low yield**.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal-ligand coordination. This reduction in coordination strength leads to less effective catalyst performance.

---

4. **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring result in **high yield**.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as strong coordinating sites, forming stable complexes with metal centers. This additional coordination enhances electron density at the metal ion, improving catalytic reactivity.

---

5. **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in **low yield**.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Side chains without coordinating groups do not contribute to metal binding, resulting in weaker overall coordination and decreased catalyst performance.

---

6. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group in the chain (e.g., mercaptoalkanoic acids) result in **high yield**.**

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Thiol groups act as soft Lewis bases and can form strong bonds with metal ions, providing additional coordination that enhances the catalytic activity of the metal center.

---

7. **Modifiers that contain aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Carbonyl groups near the carboxylate can form intramolecular interactions or engage in side reactions, hindering the ability of the carboxylate to effectively coordinate with the metal center.

---

8. **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in **low yield**.**

   - **Example (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its coordination ability with metal ions and diminishing catalytic efficiency.

---

9. **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in **high yield**.**

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

   - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional hydrogen bonding and coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

---

10. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with remote amino or hydroxyl groups (on carbons beyond C-4) result in **low yield**.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Remote functional groups may not effectively coordinate with the metal center and can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of metal-ligand interactions.

---

11. **Modifiers with bulky substituents (e.g., polyether chains) near the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can sterically hinder the approach and binding of the carboxylate group to the metal center, reducing the effectiveness of coordination and catalysis.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules capture the relationships between specific structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering combinations of functional groups and underlying physicochemical properties, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in high or low yield:

- **Coordination Enhancement**: Modifiers with multiple or strong coordinating groups (e.g., carboxylate, amino, heterocyclic nitrogen or sulfur atoms) increase coordination with metal centers, leading to higher yields.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of carboxylate groups, improving catalyst performance. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect, reducing yield.

- **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents or flexible chains near coordinating groups can hinder effective metal-ligand interactions, resulting in lower yields due to decreased coordination efficiency.

- **Functional Group Interference**: Functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, or perfluoroalkyl chains can interfere with metal coordination or alter electronic properties, leading to lower yields.

- **Hydrophobicity and Coordination Sites**: Modifiers lacking coordinating heteroatoms in their side chains or those with remote functional groups generally result in lower yields due to weaker metal interactions or steric hindrance.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the potential effectiveness of new modifiers based on their structural characteristics. This enables the selection or design of molecular modifiers to optimize and control the reaction yield, facilitating more efficient catalyst development.---------------------------------------------------------------

** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: **Modify the SMARTS patterns in Rule 2 to correctly identify electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position on the aromatic ring, including substituents like bromomethyl and nitro groups attached via a carbon linker.** Currently, the pattern `[c][F,Cl,Br,I]` only matches halogens directly attached to the aromatic carbon. Update the pattern to include EWGs attached through a carbon, such as `[c][CH2][F,Cl,Br,I]` for halomethyl groups and `[c][CH2][NX3](=O)[O-]` for nitromethyl groups.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Incorporate positional specificity into the SMARTS patterns for Rules 2 and 3 to ensure that the substituents are at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.** Use SMARTS patterns that define the relative positions on the aromatic ring, such as using recursive SMARTS or specifying ring indices to identify para-substituted aromatics.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Enhance Rule 1 by restricting the amino and carboxylic acid groups to be part of the same aliphatic chain of up to 6 carbons.** Modify the SMARTS patterns to capture this by defining an aliphatic chain of specific length connecting the amino and carboxylic acid groups, such as `[$([NX3;H2,H1])][C;$(*~[C])]{1,5}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Adjust the SMARTS patterns in Rule 7 to accurately detect aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group.** The current patterns may not correctly match molecules where the carbonyl groups are adjacent. Use a pattern like `[CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)[#6]` and ensure that it matches structures where the aldehyde or ketone is directly connected to the same carbon as the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Review and refine the SMARTS patterns across all rules to better represent the structural features described in the natural language rules.** This includes considering chain lengths, specific atom connectivity, and functional group positions. Utilize more advanced SMARTS constructs like atom maps, recursive SMARTS, and bond specifications to achieve precise pattern matching.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**Comparison with Reference Metrics**

1. **Train Confidence**

   - **Previous Metrics Average**: 
     - Mean Train Confidence = (63.52% + 53.96%)/2 ≈ **58.74%**
   - **Current Metric**: 
     - Train Confidence = **70.26%**

   **Observation**: The current train confidence has increased significantly compared to the previous average. A higher confidence indicates that when the rule conditions are met, there is a greater probability that the predicted outcome (high yield) is correct. This improvement suggests that the current rules are more precise in their predictions.

2. **Train Lift**

   - **Previous Metrics Average**:
     - Mean Train Lift = (1.2048 + 1.0559)/2 ≈ **1.1304**
   - **Current Metric**:
     - Train Lift = **1.4150**

   **Observation**: The current train lift has increased compared to the previous average. Lift measures how much better the rule is at predicting the outcome than a random guess. A lift greater than 1 indicates a positive association between the rule conditions and the predicted outcome. The higher lift value suggests that the current rules are more effective at identifying cases with high yield beyond what would be expected by chance.

3. **Train Support**

   - **Previous Metrics Average**:
     - Mean Train Support = (16.67% + 18.45%)/2 ≈ **17.56%**
   - **Current Metric**:
     - Train Support = **4.16%**

   **Observation**: There is a noticeable decrease in train support in the current rules compared to the previous average. Support reflects the proportion of the dataset for which both the rule conditions and the predicted outcome are true. A lower support means the rules apply to fewer instances in the dataset, potentially limiting their general applicability.

4. **Train Leverage**

   - **Previous Metrics Average**:
     - Mean Train Leverage = (0.0289 + (-0.0041))/2 ≈ **0.0124**
   - **Current Metric**:
     - Train Leverage = **0.0086**

   **Observation**: The current train leverage is slightly lower than the previous average but remains positive. Leverage indicates the additional predictive value of the rule beyond what is expected by chance. Positive leverage values suggest a stronger association, and although slightly decreased, the leverage is still favorable.

---

**Evaluation of Performance Improvement**

- **Positive Indicators**:
  - **Increased Confidence**: The boost from ~58.74% to 70.26% indicates that the rules are more reliable in predicting high yield when the conditions are met.
  - **Higher Lift**: An increase from ~1.1304 to 1.4150 demonstrates a stronger association between the rule conditions and the high yield outcome, making the rules more interesting and valuable.

- **Areas of Concern**:
  - **Reduced Support**: A drop from ~17.56% to 4.16% suggests that the rules now cover a smaller portion of the dataset. While the rules are more precise, they may not be as broadly applicable.
  - **Slight Decrease in Leverage**: Although leverage remains positive, the marginal decrease indicates a need to monitor this metric in future iterations.

---

**Assessment of Iterations and Local Minimum**

- **Potential Local Minimum**:
  - The increase in confidence and lift, coupled with a decrease in support, suggests that the current rules have become more specific. This specificity may limit their applicability, indicating that the optimization process is approaching a local minimum where further refinements might not yield significant overall improvements without sacrificing other metrics.

- **Sufficiency of Iterations**:
  - Considering the current balance of metrics, it's possible that the current set of rules represents an optimal trade-off between precision and coverage given the existing data. However, the decrease in support indicates that there may still be room to adjust the rules to improve their applicability.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Enhance Rule Generalization to Increase Support**

   - **Objective**: Broaden the applicability of the rules so they cover a larger portion of the dataset without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
   - **Strategies**:
     - **Identify Common Structural Features**: Analyze the high-yield modifiers to find common features that can be included in the rules, making them more general.
     - **Combine Similar Rules**: If certain rules overlap or are very specific, consider merging them to create a more general rule.
     - **Relax Overly Restrictive Conditions**: Review the conditions that may be too stringent and modify them to include more instances.

2. **Maintain High Confidence and Lift while Increasing Support**

   - **Objective**: Strive for a balance where the rules still predict high yield accurately (confidence and lift) but apply to more cases (support).
   - **Strategies**:
     - **Iterative Testing**: Slightly adjust the rules and test their impact on all metrics to find a balance.
     - **Threshold Optimization**: Experiment with different thresholds for defining "high yield" to see if adjusting these thresholds affects the support without degrading confidence and lift substantially.
     - **Exclude Outliers**: Identify and potentially exclude outliers that may be disproportionately affecting the metrics.

3. **Analyze Low Yield Cases for Insight**

   - **Objective**: Understand why certain modifiers result in low yield to refine rules that avoid these pitfalls.
   - **Strategies**:
     - **Investigate Structural Patterns**: Look for structural features common among low-yield modifiers that might not have been previously considered.
     - **Contrast Analysis**: Compare high-yield and low-yield modifiers side by side to identify subtle differences that could be incorporated into the rules.

4. **Incorporate Additional Data Features**

   - **Objective**: Utilize more data attributes that may improve rule performance.
   - **Strategies**:
     - **Physicochemical Properties**: Include properties such as pKa, steric hindrance parameters, or electronic distribution that may affect yield.
     - **Molecular Descriptors**: Use computational descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, logP) to capture additional variance in the data.

5. **Validation Using Test Data**

   - **Objective**: Ensure that the improved rules generalize well to unseen data.
   - **Strategies**:
     - **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation to assess how the rules perform on different subsets of data.
     - **Monitor Overfitting**: Be cautious of overfitting to training data, which can happen when confidence and lift are high but support is low.

6. **Consult Domain Expertise**

   - **Objective**: Leverage expert knowledge to refine the rules based on chemical intuition and experience.
   - **Strategies**:
     - **Expert Review of Rules**: Have chemists or catalysis experts review the current rules to suggest adjustments based on theoretical and practical considerations.
     - **Incorporate Mechanistic Insights**: Use understanding of the catalytic mechanism to inform rule modifications.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules show improvement in predictive precision (higher confidence and lift), indicating they are more effective at identifying modifiers that result in high yield. However, the decrease in support suggests that the rules have become more specialized and apply to fewer cases. To enhance the performance further:

- **Aim to Generalize**: Work on adjusting the rules to cover a broader range of modifiers while maintaining acceptable levels of confidence and lift.
- **Balance Metrics**: Continuously monitor how changes impact all metrics to avoid improving one at the expense of others.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continue with additional iterations, focusing on incremental adjustments informed by both data analysis and domain knowledge.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can become more robust and valuable for predicting catalyst performance across a wider array of modifiers, ultimately supporting the goals of the research program.

### 1. Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation and Training Sets

**Previous Accuracies:**

- **Validation Accuracies**: Consistently high across iterations, with values such as `[0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]`.
- **Test Accuracies**: Ranging from **0.625** to **0.75**.

**Current Accuracies:**

- **5-Fold Validation Accuracy**: **0.6** (multiple iterations).
- **Classification Model Accuracy**: Ranging from **0.514** to **0.742** in different iterations.

**Comments:**

- **Decrease in Accuracy**: The current validation accuracies (**0.6** on average) are notably lower than previous accuracies (**0.76**). This decline suggests that the current set of rules may not be effectively capturing the underlying relationships in the data.
- **Stability Across Iterations**: The accuracies in the current iterations are fluctuating between **0.514** and **0.742**, indicating inconsistency and potential overfitting or underfitting issues.

### 2. Analysis Based on SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into how individual features (rules) contribute to the model's predictions. By examining molecules where the model's predictions do not match the experimental values, we can identify which rules are potentially problematic.

#### **Methodology:**

- **Overestimated Loadings**: Cases where the predicted loading is **high**, but the experimental value is **low**.
- **Underestimated Loadings**: Cases where the predicted loading is **low**, but the experimental value is **high**.
- **Focus on SHAP Values**: For each mispredicted molecule, identify the rules with the most significant positive (overestimation) or negative (underestimation) SHAP values.

#### **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

1. **Molecule**: **C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**

   - **Prediction**: High loading
   - **Experimental**: Low loading
   - **Significant SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule4 SHAP**: **0.2294**
     - **Rule9 SHAP**: **-0.0270**

   - **Interpretation**: **Rule4** is contributing significantly to the high prediction.

2. **Molecule**: **C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F**

   - **Prediction**: High loading
   - **Experimental**: Low loading
   - **Significant SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule4 SHAP**: **0.1701**
     - **Rule8 SHAP**: **0.1925**
     - **Rule6 SHAP**: **-0.2836**

   - **Interpretation**: **Rule8** and **Rule4** are contributing to the overestimation, while **Rule6** is negatively contributing.

3. **Molecule**: **C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=NC=C2)C(=O)O**

   - **Prediction**: High loading

     - **Rule8 SHAP**: **0.2476**

   - **Interpretation**: **Rule6** and **Rule8** contribute positively, but **Rule1** and **Rule2** are causing underestimation.

### 3. Analysis of Discrepancies and Rule Effectiveness

#### **Rule-Specific Observations:**

- **Rule1**:

  - **Impact**: Negative SHAP values in underestimated loadings.
  - **Potential Issue**: May be too broad or incorrectly penalizing certain structures.

- **Rule2**:

  - **Impact**: Positive SHAP values in some underestimated cases but negative in others.
  - **Potential Issue**: Inconsistent contribution suggests the rule may need refinement.

- **Rule4**:

  - **Impact**: Significant positive SHAP values in overestimations and negative in underestimations.
  - **Potential Issue**: Overgeneralization leading to misclassification.

- **Rule8**:

  - **Impact**: High positive SHAP values contributing to overestimations; negative contributions in underestimations.
  - **Potential Issue**: May not adequately capture the nuances of perfluorinated carboxylic acids.

- **Rule9**:

  - **Impact**: Negative SHAP values in underestimated loadings.
  - **Potential Issue**: The rule might be inaccurately penalizing certain molecules.

#### **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**

- **Underfitting Indication**: The overall decrease in accuracy suggests that the model is underfitting, failing to capture complex relationships in the data.

- **Overfitting Potential**: High variance in accuracies across iterations indicates potential overfitting to training data in some folds.

### 4. Recommendations for Improving Current Rules

Based on the SHAP analysis and performance metrics, the following recommendations are proposed to improve the current rules:

#### **A. Refine Rule4**

**Current Rule4**:

- **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring result in high yield.**

**Issue**:

- **Overgeneralization**: Rule4 applies broadly to all heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen, which may not always result in high yield.
- **Impact**: Contributes to overestimations and underestimations.

**Recommendations**:

1. **Add Structural Specificity**:

   - **Specify Ring Size**: Limit to 5-membered rings, for example.
   - **Position of Nitrogen**: Require nitrogen to be adjacent to the carboxyl group.

2. **Consider Substituent Effects**:

   - **Exclude Certain Substituents**: If electron-donating groups reduce yield, specify their exclusion.
   - **Include Additional Functional Groups**: Incorporate other coordinating groups that enhance activity.

**Proposed Revised Rule4**:

- **Modifiers that are **5-membered** heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing **adjacent nitrogen atoms** in the ring, without electron-donating substituents, result in **high yield**.**

#### **B. Adjust Rule9**

**Current Rule9**:

- **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in high yield.**

**Issue**:

- **Negative Contribution**: Rule9 contributes negatively in some underestimated cases.
- **Lack of Specificity**: Not all polyhydroxylated acids may result in high yield.

**Recommendations**:

1. **Define Chain Length**:

   - **Optimal Chain Length**: Specify the number of carbons (e.g., C6 sugars like gluconic acid).

2. **Consider Stereochemistry**:

   - **Specific Configurations**: Certain stereoisomers may be more effective.

**Proposed Revised Rule9**:

- **Modifiers that are **polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of **5-6 carbons** and specific stereochemistry (e.g., D-gluconic acid) result in **high yield**.**

#### **C. Evaluate and Refine Rule2**

**Current Rule2**:

- **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in high yield.**

**Issue**:

- **Inconsistent Impact**: Both positive and negative SHAP contributions suggest the rule may be too simplistic.

**Recommendations**:

1. **Specify Electron-Withdrawing Group Strength**:

   - **Differentiate Between Groups**: Recognize that not all electron-withdrawing groups have the same effect.

2. **Include Meta-Substituted Compounds**:

   - **Expand Scope**: Consider effects of substituents in other positions.

**Proposed Revised Rule2**:

- **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with **strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, cyano)** at the **para position**, and no electron-donating groups elsewhere on the ring, result in **high yield**.**

#### **D. Modify Rule8**

**Current Rule8**:

- **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in low yield.**

**Issue**:

- **Overgeneralization**: May not account for partial fluorination or chain length effects.

**Recommendations**:

1. **Specify Degree of Fluorination**:

   - **Full vs. Partial Fluorination**: Differentiate between perfluorinated and partially fluorinated acids.

2. **Include Chain Length Considerations**:

   - **Short Chains**: Short-chain perfluorinated acids may behave differently.

**Proposed Revised Rule8**:

- **Modifiers that are **long-chain perfluorinated** carboxylic acids (chain length > C6) result in **low yield** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects.**

#### **E. Introduce New Rules Based on Observations**

1. **Rule for Amino Acids with Coordinating Side Chains**:

   - **Observation**: Molecules like **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N** (Aspartic acid) are underestimated.

   - **Proposed Rule**:

     - **Modifiers that are amino acids with **side chains containing additional carboxylate groups** result in **high yield**.**

2. **Rule for Aliphatic Amines with Short Chains**:

   - **Observation**: Molecules with adjacent amino and carboxyl groups are sometimes misclassified.

   - **Proposed Rule**:

     - **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group on the **alpha carbon** result in **high yield**.**

#### **F. Address Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Enhance Model Complexity**:

  - **Incorporate Interaction Terms**: Allow for interactions between rules.
  - **Use Weighted Rules**: Assign weights to rules based on their predictive power.

- **Cross-Validation**:

  - **Ensure Robustness**: Use cross-validation techniques to prevent overfitting.

- **Update Feature Matrix**:

  - **Include Additional Descriptors**: Molecular descriptors such as electron density, steric hindrance, and hydrogen bonding capacity.

### 5. Conclusion

By analyzing the accuracies and SHAP values, we've identified that **Rule4**, **Rule9**, and **Rule2** are significantly contributing to the model's mispredictions. Refining these rules by adding specificity and incorporating additional chemical insights can improve the model's performance.

Implementing these recommendations should:

- **Increase Validation Accuracy**: By better capturing the structural features that lead to high or low yield.
- **Reduce Misclassifications**: Through more accurate rules that align with experimental observations.
- **Enhance Generalization**: By preventing overgeneralization and addressing underfitting issues.

**Next Steps**:

- **Test Revised Rules**: Update the feature matrix with the revised rules and re-evaluate the model.
- **Monitor Performance**: Compare new validation accuracies with previous results to assess improvements.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continue the process of analyzing SHAP values and refining rules until satisfactory performance is achieved.

### Appendices

#### **Summary of Proposed Rule Modifications**

- **Rule4**: Add specificity regarding ring size, position of nitrogen, and substituents.
- **Rule9**: Specify chain length and stereochemistry for polyhydroxylated acids.
- **Rule2**: Differentiate the strength of electron-withdrawing groups and exclude electron-donating groups elsewhere.
- **Rule8**: Limit to long-chain perfluorinated acids and consider degree of fluorination.

---

By adopting these adjustments, we aim to enhance the predictive capability of the model, aligning it more closely with the experimental data and underlying chemical principles.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current task involves optimizing rules that predict the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on the structural features of molecular modifiers. The discussions above highlight key observations from the analysis of rule performance metrics, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, and accuracies from validation sets. Here is a summary and suggestions for improving the current rules:

1. **Performance Metrics Analysis**

   - **Increased Confidence and Lift**: The current rules show an increase in train confidence (from ~58.74% to 70.26%) and train lift (from ~1.13 to 1.415), indicating better precision and stronger associations between rule conditions and high yield.
   - **Decreased Support**: Train support has decreased from ~17.56% to 4.16%, suggesting that the rules apply to fewer instances in the dataset, making them more specific but less general.
   - **Slight Decrease in Leverage**: Train leverage has slightly decreased but remains positive, indicating a continued positive association between rule conditions and outcomes.

2. **Accuracy and SHAP Analysis**

   - **Decrease in Validation Accuracy**: Current validation accuracies have decreased (average of 0.6) compared to previous accuracies (up to 0.76), suggesting that the current rules may not effectively capture the underlying relationships.
   - **Inconsistent Model Performance**: Accuracies fluctuate across iterations, indicating potential overfitting or underfitting issues.
   - **SHAP Value Insights**: Analysis of SHAP values highlights that certain rules (e.g., Rules 2, 4, 8, and 9) may be overgeneralized or not specific enough, leading to mispredictions in yield.

3. **Rule-Specific Observations and Suggestions**

   - **Rule 1 (Modifiers with Amino and Carboxylic Groups in Aliphatic Chains)**
     - **Suggestion**: Refine the rule to ensure the amino and carboxylic acid groups are part of the same aliphatic chain of up to 6 carbons. Update the SMARTS patterns to capture this specificity.
   
   - **Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups)**
     - **Issue**: Current SMARTS patterns may not correctly identify all electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position, especially those attached via a carbon linker.
     - **Suggestion**:
       - **Modify SMARTS Patterns**: Update the patterns to include EWGs attached through a carbon atom, such as halomethyl and nitromethyl groups.
       - **Incorporate Positional Specificity**: Ensure that substituents are at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group by using recursive SMARTS or specifying ring indices.
       - **Differentiate EWG Strength**: Recognize that not all EWGs have the same effect and adjust the rule to account for varying strengths.

   - **Rule 4 (Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Atoms)**
     - **Issue**: Rule may be overgeneralized, leading to mispredictions.
     - **Suggestion**:
       - **Add Structural Specificity**: Specify ring size (e.g., 5-membered rings) and the position of nitrogen atoms in the ring.
       - **Consider Substituent Effects**: Exclude electron-donating substituents that might reduce yield and include additional coordinating groups that enhance activity.

   - **Rule 7 (Modifiers with Aldehyde or Ketone Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Group)**
     - **Issue**: Current patterns may not accurately detect these functional groups.
     - **Suggestion**: Adjust the SMARTS patterns to correctly identify aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group, ensuring accurate matching of structures where these groups are directly connected.

   - **Rule 8 (Perfluorinated Carboxylic Acids)**
     - **Issue**: Rule may be too broad, not accounting for partial fluorination or chain length effects.
     - **Suggestion**:
       - **Specify Degree of Fluorination**: Differentiate between fully and partially fluorinated carboxylic acids.
       - **Include Chain Length Considerations**: Limit the rule to long-chain perfluorinated acids (e.g., chain length > C6).

   - **Rule 9 (Polyhydroxylated Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids)**
     - **Issue**: Lack of specificity may lead to negative contributions in model predictions.
     - **Suggestion**:
       - **Define Chain Length and Stereochemistry**: Specify the optimal chain lengths (e.g., 5-6 carbons) and important stereochemical configurations.
       - **Refine SMARTS Patterns**: Update patterns to capture these specific structural features.

4. **General Suggestions for Rule Improvement**

   - **Incorporate Positional Specificity**: Across all relevant rules, include positional specificity to ensure functional groups are correctly situated within the molecule (e.g., para position on aromatic rings).
   - **Use Advanced SMARTS Constructs**: Employ recursive SMARTS, atom maps, and bond specifications to improve pattern matching precision.
   - **Balance Precision and Coverage**: Aim to increase train support without significantly compromising confidence and lift by making rules more general where appropriate.
   - **Introduce New Rules Based on Observations**:
     - **Modifiers with Side Chains Containing Additional Carboxylate Groups**: Recognize that amino acids like aspartic acid with side chains containing extra carboxylate groups result in high yield.
     - **Modifiers with Alpha-Amino Carboxylic Acids**: Consider that aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group on the alpha carbon lead to high yield.

5. **Address Overfitting and Underfitting**

   - **Enhance Model Complexity**: Incorporate interaction terms and assign weights to rules based on their predictive power.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure rules generalize well to unseen data.
   - **Incorporate Additional Data Features**: Include physicochemical properties and molecular descriptors to capture more variance in the data.

**Possibility for Further Optimization**

Based on the analysis, there is clear evidence that the current rules can be further optimized without overfitting. Refining the SMARTS patterns, adding structural specificity, and adjusting rules to better align with chemical principles can improve the model's accuracy and applicability. The decrease in validation accuracy and inconsistencies in SHAP value contributions indicate that the rules require further refinement to accurately predict the reaction yield.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

1. **Modifiers containing both an amino group and at least one carboxylic acid group attached to an aliphatic chain of up to 6 carbons result in **high yield**.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

   - **Rationale**: The presence of an amino group and carboxylate(s) allows for multiple coordination sites with the metal center. This enhances catalyst efficiency through strong chelation and stabilization of the active site.

---

2. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in **high yield**.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, strengthening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. This enhances catalytic activity through improved electron acceptance at the metal center.

---

3. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the para position result in **low yield**.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal-ligand coordination. This reduction in coordination strength leads to less effective catalyst performance.

---

4. **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring result in **high yield**.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as strong coordinating sites, forming stable complexes with metal centers. This additional coordination enhances electron density at the metal ion, improving catalytic reactivity.

---

5. **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in **low yield**.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Side chains without coordinating groups do not contribute to metal binding, resulting in weaker overall coordination and decreased catalyst performance.

---

6. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group in the chain (e.g., mercaptoalkanoic acids) result in **high yield**.**

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Thiol groups act as soft Lewis bases and can form strong bonds with metal ions, providing additional coordination that enhances the catalytic activity of the metal center.

---

7. **Modifiers that contain aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Carbonyl groups near the carboxylate can form intramolecular interactions or engage in side reactions, hindering the ability of the carboxylate to effectively coordinate with the metal center.

---

8. **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in **low yield**.**

   - **Example (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its coordination ability with metal ions and diminishing catalytic efficiency.

---

9. **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in **high yield**.**

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

   - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional hydrogen bonding and coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

---

10. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with remote amino or hydroxyl groups (on carbons beyond C-4) result in **low yield**.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Remote functional groups may not effectively coordinate with the metal center and can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of metal-ligand interactions.

---

11. **Modifiers with bulky substituents (e.g., polyether chains) near the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can sterically hinder the approach and binding of the carboxylate group to the metal center, reducing the effectiveness of coordination and catalysis.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules capture the relationships between specific structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering combinations of functional groups and underlying physicochemical properties, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in high or low yield:

- **Coordination Enhancement**: Modifiers with multiple or strong coordinating groups (e.g., carboxylate, amino, heterocyclic nitrogen or sulfur atoms) increase coordination with metal centers, leading to higher yields.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of carboxylate groups, improving catalyst performance. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect, reducing yield.

- **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents or flexible chains near coordinating groups can hinder effective metal-ligand interactions, resulting in lower yields due to decreased coordination efficiency.

- **Functional Group Interference**: Functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, or perfluoroalkyl chains can interfere with metal coordination or alter electronic properties, leading to lower yields.

- **Hydrophobicity and Coordination Sites**: Modifiers lacking coordinating heteroatoms in their side chains or those with remote functional groups generally result in lower yields due to weaker metal interactions or steric hindrance.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the potential effectiveness of new modifiers based on their structural characteristics. This enables the selection or design of molecular modifiers to optimize and control the reaction yield, facilitating more efficient catalyst development.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 1** to ensure that the amino group and carboxylic acid groups are part of the same aliphatic chain of up to 6 carbons. Update the SMARTS pattern to capture this specificity. Use the SMARTS pattern: `N[C;$(C([CX3](=O)[O-])[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH3])]`, which ensures that the amino group is connected to a carbon chain terminating with a carboxylate group within 6 carbons.

- **Advice 2**: **Modify Rule 2** to accurately identify aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position, including those attached via a carbon linker. Update the SMARTS pattern to include EWGs such as halomethyl and nitromethyl groups. Use recursive SMARTS to specify substituents at the para position relative to the carboxyl group:
  ```
  [cH]1[cH][cH][c]([CX3](=O)[O-])[cH][c]1[$(a)-!@[#6]-[EWG]]
  ```
  where `[EWG]` represents strong electron-withdrawing groups like `[$(F),$(Cl),$(Br),$(I),$(N(=O)=O),$(C(=O)C)]`.

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance Rule 4** by adding structural specificity to include heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in specific positions within a 5- or 6-membered ring. Exclude modifiers with electron-donating substituents. Adjust the SMARTS pattern to target pyridine and pyrazole rings with carboxyl groups in specified positions:
  ```
  [n][cH][cH][c](C(=O)[O-])[cH]
  ```
  for pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, ensuring nitrogen is in the ring and the carboxylate is in the correct position.

- **Advice 4**: **Adjust Rule 7** by refining SMARTS patterns to correctly identify modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group. Use patterns that detect aldehyde or ketone functionalities directly attached to the same carbon as the carboxylate:
  ```
  [CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)[O-]
  ```
  This pattern captures dicarbonyl compounds where an aldehyde or ketone group is adjacent to the carboxylate.

- **Advice 5**: **Refine Rule 8** to specify the degree of fluorination and chain length for perfluorinated carboxylic acids. Amend the rule to focus on fully perfluorinated carboxylic acids with chain lengths greater than 6 carbons. Update the SMARTS pattern to:
  ```
  [CX4](F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)C(=O)[O-]
  ```
  to represent perfluorinated pentanoic acid and longer chains.

- **Advice 6**: **Enhance Rule 9** by defining chain length and stereochemistry of polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids. Specify modifiers with 5-6 carbon chains and multiple hydroxyl groups in specific positions. Adjust the SMARTS pattern to:
  ```
  [C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C(=O)[O-]
  ```
  capturing the stereochemistry of gluconic acid.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate positional specificity** across all relevant rules to ensure functional groups are correctly situated. Use advanced SMARTS constructs like atom indices and ring numbering to precisely define substituent positions. For instance, in aromatic rings, specify the para position using ring bonds:
  ```
  [c:1][cH][cH][cH][c:2][cH][c:1][c]([CX3](=O)[O-])[c:2]
  ```

- **Advice 8**: **Improve Rule 1 SMARTS patterns** by ensuring multiple coordination sites are captured. Include patterns that detect amino and carboxylate groups separated by specific chain lengths:
  ```
  N[C;R0][CH2][CH2][CH2][C](=O)[O-]
  ```
  for 5-aminopentanoic acid, ensuring the amino group is on the alpha carbon and the carboxylate is at the terminal position.

- **Advice 9**: **Introduce a new rule** for modifiers with side chains containing additional carboxylate groups, resulting in high yield. For example, include modifiers like aspartic acid. Use the SMARTS pattern:
  ```
  N[C@@H](C(=O)[O-])[CH2][C](=O)[O-]
  ```
  capturing amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups.

- **Advice 10**: **Differentiate between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups** in Rules 2 and 3 by referencing Hammett substituent constants. Create separate rules for strong EWGs (e.g., NO₂, CF₃) and moderate EWGs (e.g., halogens), updating expectations accordingly.

- **Advice 11**: **Balance precision and coverage** by generalizing rules where appropriate without sacrificing confidence. For instance, in Rule 1, include aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups within 5 carbons, allowing minor substituents if they do not hinder coordination.

- **Advice 12**: **Address misclassifications** by adjusting rules to accommodate exceptions. Introduce exception clauses or combine rules using logical operators. For example, exclude modifiers with bulky groups near coordinating sites even if they fit other criteria.

- **Advice 13**: **Incorporate additional molecular descriptors** such as calculated pKa values or LogP to capture electronic and steric effects not fully described by structural patterns. This can improve rule predictive power.

- **Advice 14**: **Validate and iterate rules** using cross-validation techniques. After refining rules, test them on different subsets of data to ensure they generalize well and adjust as necessary to prevent overfitting.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

---

11. **Modifiers that are amino acids with non-polar side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in **low yield**.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Side chains without coordinating groups do not enhance metal binding. This leads to weaker overall coordination and decreased catalytic activity.

---

12. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-sulfhydryl groups result in **low yield**.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

13. **Modifiers that are medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (C6 to C8) without additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **Octanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Medium-chain carboxylic acids strike a balance between hydrophobic interactions and chain flexibility, facilitating efficient catalyst-substrate interactions.

---

14. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids linked via a flexible aliphatic chain to additional coordinating functional groups result in **high yield**.**

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: The flexible aliphatic linker allows the coordinating functional group to interact effectively with the metal center without steric hindrance from the aromatic ring.

---

**End of Rules**

These rules reflect the relationships between specific structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By combining multiple functional groups and considering underlying physicochemical properties, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in high or low yield:

- **Enhanced Metal Coordination**: Modifiers with multiple or strong coordinating groups (e.g., amino acids with coordinating side chains, heterocyclic nitrogen, thiol groups) improve catalyst activity by forming stable complexes with the metal center.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase carboxylate acidity, strengthening metal-ligand interactions and resulting in higher yields. Conversely, electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, leading to lower yields.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky substituents or flexible chains near coordinating groups hinder effective metal-ligand interactions, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Functional Group Positioning**: Proximal functional groups contribute more effectively to metal coordination than remote groups. Remote groups may not participate in coordination and can introduce steric hindrance.

- **Functional Group Interference**: Functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, or perfluoroalkyl chains near the coordinating site can interfere with metal coordination or alter electronic properties, leading to lower yields.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the potential effectiveness of new modifiers based on their structural characteristics. This enables the selection or design of molecular modifiers to optimize and control the reaction yield, facilitating more efficient catalyst development.

These rules demonstrate how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction:

- **High Yield Modifiers**: Contain functional groups capable of effective metal coordination (e.g., amino acids with coordinating side chains, heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen atoms, proximal thiol or hydroxyl groups). These features enhance metal-ligand interactions, leading to improved catalyst performance.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**: Lack coordinating groups, have functional groups that are too distant or hinder coordination (e.g., bulky substituents, distal amino or hydroxyl groups), or contain interfering functional groups (e.g., aldehydes, ketones, perfluoroalkyl chains). These factors weaken metal-ligand interactions or introduce steric and electronic effects that reduce catalytic efficiency.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield and can design new modifiers to optimize the reaction outcome based on their structural characteristics.

The rule shows appropriate **complexity** by combining heterocyclic structures with coordinating atoms. **Coverage** is strong, with three data points: Nicotinic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid. The rule achieves a suitable **balance**.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 lacks sufficient **coverage**, as it is supported by only one data point: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid. While it is **clear** and provides adequate **property insight** regarding the role of thiol groups, the limited data support weakens its effectiveness. The rule could be strengthened by identifying additional supporting examples to improve **coverage** and **balance**.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 satisfies the criteria well. It is **clear**, indicating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups result in low yield. The **property insight** is adequate, explaining how distal groups are less effective in metal coordination. The rule demonstrates appropriate **complexity** by considering both chain length and functional group position. **Coverage** is solid, supported by three data points: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid. It maintains a good **balance**.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 has insufficient **coverage**, with only one supporting data point: Gluconic acid. While the rule is **clear** and provides adequate **property insight** about multiple hydroxyl groups enhancing coordination, the limited data support reduces its reliability. To improve, additional examples should be identified to strengthen **coverage** and **balance**.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 meets the criteria effectively. It is **clear**, specifying that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in low yield. The **property insight** is adequate, explaining interference with metal coordination. The rule shows appropriate **complexity** by combining functional group adjacency. **Coverage** is robust, with three data points: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 4-oxoheptanedioic acid. It achieves a good **balance**.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 lacks sufficient **coverage**, supported by only one data point: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid. Although the rule is **clear** and offers appropriate **property insight** on electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine, the limited data support undermines its robustness. Increasing **coverage** with more examples would enhance the rule's effectiveness.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 aligns well with the criteria. It is **clear**, indicating that bulky substituents near the carboxyl group lead to low yield. The **property insight** is adequate, relating steric hindrance to reduced coordination. The rule demonstrates appropriate **complexity** by considering substituent size and position. **Coverage** is acceptable, supported by two data points: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid. The rule maintains a good **balance**.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 has insufficient **coverage**, with only one supporting data point: octanoic acid. While the rule is **clear** and provides adequate **property insight** regarding optimal chain length, additional supporting examples are needed to strengthen **coverage** and improve **balance**.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 lacks sufficient **coverage**, supported by only one data point: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid. Although the rule is **clear** and offers appropriate **property insight** on flexible chains enhancing coordination, the limited data support reduces its reliability. Identifying more examples would enhance **coverage** and **balance**.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 has insufficient **coverage**, with only one supporting data point: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid. The rule is **clear** and provides proper **property insight** on sulfhydryl group effects, but limited data support weakens its effectiveness. Increasing **coverage** would improve the rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 lacks sufficient **coverage**, being supported by only one data point, which overlaps with Rule 11. It is **clear** and offers adequate **property insight** about flexible polyether chains impacting coordination. However, the overlap and limited **coverage** affect its overall effectiveness. Combining this rule with Rule 11 or adding more supporting examples could strengthen it.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Combine Rules with Insufficient Coverage to Improve Robustness**

  - **Action**: Merge rules that have similar property insights but suffer from limited data support. For instance:
    - **Combine Rule 6** (Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal thiol groups result in high yield) with **Rule 1** (Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms result in high yield) to form a broader rule:
      - **Revised Rule**: *Modifiers containing side chains or functional groups with strong coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., thiol, amino, hydroxyl) near the carboxyl group result in high yield.*
    - **Combine Rule 12** (Modifiers that are medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids result in high yield) with **Rule 13** (Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids linked via a flexible aliphatic chain to coordinating groups result in high yield) to create a more general rule about chain length and flexibility enhancing yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Collect Additional Data to Support Underrepresented Rules**

  - **Action**: Increase the dataset by researching and testing additional modifiers that fit underrepresented rules to strengthen their validity. Specifically:
    - **For Rule 8** (Polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in high yield): Identify and include more examples of such compounds to enhance coverage.
    - **For Rule 10** (Perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in low yield): Seek additional perfluorinated compounds to confirm this trend.

- **Advice 3**: **Merge Overlapping Rules to Reduce Redundancy**

  - **Action**: Consolidate rules that address similar structural features affecting yield. For example:
    - **Combine Rule 11** (Modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group result in low yield) and **Rule 15** (Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains near the carboxyl group result in low yield) into a single rule focusing on steric hindrance and conformational flexibility impeding metal coordination:
      - **Merged Rule**: *Modifiers with bulky or highly flexible substituents near the carboxyl group result in low yield due to steric hindrance or increased conformational entropy affecting metal-ligand coordination.*

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rules with Limited Coverage by Broadening Their Scope**

  - **Action**: Adjust rules that are too narrow due to limited data to encompass a wider range of modifiers. For instance:
    - **Revise Rule 14** (Modifiers with para-substituted sulfhydryl groups on aromatic rings result in low yield) to include other functional groups that may undergo side reactions or have reduced coordination ability.
      - **Expanded Rule**: *Modifiers with functional groups on aromatic rings that are prone to side reactions or have reduced ability to coordinate with metals (e.g., sulfhydryl, aldehyde groups) result in low yield.*

- **Advice 5**: **Emphasize the Role of Functional Group Positioning in Existing Rules**

  - **Action**: Incorporate insights from underrepresented rules into existing ones by stressing the importance of functional group proximity to the coordination site. For example:
    - In **Rule 7** (Modifiers with distal functional groups result in low yield), highlight that not only amino or hydroxyl groups but also other potential coordinating groups are less effective when distant from the carboxylate.

- **Advice 6**: **Set a Minimum Data Requirement for Rule Validation**

  - **Action**: Establish a criterion that each rule must be supported by at least three data points to ensure reliability. Reevaluate rules that do not meet this criterion and either gather more data or integrate them into broader rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Review and Update Rationale for Rules Based on Physicochemical Principles**

  - **Action**: Ensure that the rationale for each rule accurately reflects the underlying chemistry. For rules that are being combined or expanded, update the rationale to explain the broader applicability. This will improve the understanding and predictive power of the rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Cross-Validate Rules Against Entire Dataset**

  - **Action**: Systematically check all modifiers in the dataset against the revised rules to identify any inconsistencies or exceptions. Adjust rules as necessary to account for any outliers, ensuring that the rules comprehensively cover the observed data.

- **Advice 9**: **Simplify Rules Where Appropriate to Enhance Usability**

  - **Action**: Streamline overly complex rules without losing critical details. Clear and concise rules are easier to apply and reduce the likelihood of misclassification. For example, generalize rules that rely on specific substituents to focus on the electronic or steric effects those substituents impart.

- **Advice 10**: **Prioritize Rules Based on Impact and Reliability**

  - **Action**: Rank the rules according to their coverage and the strength of their supporting data. Focus on refining the most impactful and well-supported rules first, as they will provide the greatest benefit in predicting reaction outcomes.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, thiol groups) result in **high yield**.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Similar to Cysteine)

   - **Rationale**: Side chains with coordinating heteroatoms can form strong interactions with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity and increasing yield.

---

2. **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with non-coordinating side chains (e.g., alkyl or phenyl groups without heteroatoms) result in **low yield**.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Derivative of Lysine)

   - **Rationale**: Lack of additional coordinating groups in the side chain leads to weaker metal-ligand interactions, resulting in lower catalytic efficiency and reduced yield.

---

3. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating with metals (e.g., amino, nitro groups) result in **high yield**.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Coordinating groups at the para position enhance metal-ligand coordination, improving catalyst performance and increasing yield.

---

4. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents that are non-coordinating or electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy groups) result in **low yield**.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating or non-coordinating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group and do not assist in metal coordination, leading to reduced catalyst effectiveness.

---

5. **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metals result in **high yield**.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, strengthening metal-ligand interactions and enhancing catalytic activity.

---

6. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal thiol groups result in **high yield**.**

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Thiol groups are strong ligands that can form stable bonds with metal ions, improving catalyst stability and increasing yield.

---

7. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups (e.g., amino or hydroxyl groups located beyond the fourth carbon) result in **low yield**.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Functional groups far from the carboxylate are less effective in coordinating with the metal center, leading to weaker catalyst interactions and lower yield.

---

8. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group result in **high yield**.**

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

   - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding and catalytic efficiency.

---

9. **Modifiers that contain aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Carbonyl groups near the carboxylate can interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, hindering catalyst function and reducing yield.

---

10. **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in **low yield**.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal-ligand interactions and decreasing catalytic activity.

---

11. **Modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can cause steric hindrance, impeding effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center, resulting in reduced catalyst performance.

---

12. **Modifiers that are medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (C6 to C8) without additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **Octanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Medium-chain carboxylic acids have optimal chain length that allows favorable interactions with the catalyst without introducing steric hindrance, enhancing yield.

---

13. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids linked via a flexible aliphatic chain to additional coordinating functional groups result in **high yield** when the chain length allows effective coordination.**

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: The flexible aliphatic chain positions the coordinating group appropriately to interact with the metal center, improving catalyst efficiency and increasing yield.

---

14. **Modifiers with para-substituted sulfhydryl groups on aromatic rings result in **low yield**.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Sulfhydryl groups on aromatic rings may not coordinate effectively due to resonance stabilization and can undergo oxidative side reactions, reducing catalyst performance.

---

15. **Modifiers that contain flexible polyether chains near the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Flexible polyether chains increase conformational entropy and may hinder effective metal-ligand coordination, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

**End of Rules**

These rules demonstrate how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction:

- **High Yield Modifiers**: Contain functional groups capable of effective metal coordination (e.g., amino acids with coordinating side chains, heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen atoms, proximal thiol or hydroxyl groups). These features enhance metal-ligand interactions, leading to improved catalyst performance.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**: Lack coordinating groups, have functional groups that are too distant or hinder coordination (e.g., bulky substituents, distal amino or hydroxyl groups), or contain interfering functional groups (e.g., aldehydes, ketones, perfluoroalkyl chains). These factors weaken metal-ligand interactions or introduce steric and electronic effects that reduce catalytic efficiency.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield and can design new modifiers to optimize the reaction outcome based on their structural characteristics.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise the SMARTS pattern for the α-amino acid backbone in Rule 1 and Rule 2 to accurately detect α-amino acids.**

  The current SMARTS pattern `alpha_amino_acid_pat = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3;H2][CH1][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]')` may be too specific and misses some α-amino acids like glutamic acid and aspartic acid in the dataset. A more general pattern like `'[NX3][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` should be used to match any α-amino acid backbone where the alpha carbon has a variable side chain (`[*]`).

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct the side chain detection logic in Rule 1 and Rule 2 to properly identify side chain atoms.**

  The code currently may not accurately isolate side chain atoms. Update the logic to exclude backbone atoms (the nitrogen, alpha carbon, and carboxyl group) and capture all atoms connected to the alpha carbon excluding these backbone atoms.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Ensure proper traversal of side chains to detect coordinating heteroatoms in Rule 1.**

  While traversing the side chain, the code should comprehensively check all connected atoms for coordinating heteroatoms (N, O, S). Modify the traversal to avoid prematurely stopping and missing coordinating atoms that are not directly bonded to the alpha carbon.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Modify the SMARTS patterns in Rule 3 and Rule 4 to precisely identify para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids.**

  The current patterns may not correctly detect compounds like 4-aminobenzoic acid. Use a SMARTS pattern like `'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O'` to identify benzoic acid moiety and then check for substituents at the para position using appropriate atom indexing or more specific SMARTS for para-substituents.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Improve the method of identifying para-substituents in aromatic rings for Rule 3 and Rule 4.**

  Rather than assuming atom positions, use SMARTS that inherently specify para-substitution, such as `'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)[$(N),$(O),$(S)]'` for coordinating groups and adjust accordingly for non-coordinating groups.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Adjust the logic for matching heterocyclic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms in Rule 5.**

  The current pattern may be too restrictive. Use a broader SMARTS pattern like `'[nH0;!+0][#6]*[C](=O)[O,H]'` to match heterocycles containing nitrogen adjacent to a carboxylic acid group, covering more potential matches.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Add comprehensive unit tests using the example compounds provided for each rule.**

  Validate each rule's code using the specified examples to ensure correct matches. This will help identify mismatches between the intended rule interpretation and the code implementation.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Include more detailed logging and error messages to facilitate debugging.**

  In cases where matches fail or exceptions occur, detailed logs can help pinpoint the issue, whether it is due to the SMARTS pattern, the molecule's structure, or traversal logic errors.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Review and update SMARTS patterns using RDKit's molecule debugging tools.**

  Utilize RDKit's visualization and debugging capabilities to test and refine SMARTS patterns interactively, ensuring they match the intended chemical structures.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Implement all 15 rules from the rules list to capture all relevant features in the dataset.**

  Expanding the code to cover all the rules will provide a more comprehensive feature matrix and improve the accuracy of the transformation from language rules to numeric features.

**Performance Insights:**

1. **Confidence Levels**:
   - The **current rules' confidence** ranges from **0.5000** to **0.7308**, with an **average confidence** around **0.6022**.
   - Compared to the **reference confidence** ([0.6352, 0.5396]), the current rules show comparable or slightly improved confidence in some cases (e.g., Rule 4 and Rule 8).

2. **Lift Values**:
   - The **current rules' lift** ranges from **1.0000** to **1.4690**, indicating that the rules generally improve the prediction over random chance.
   - The lifts for **Rule 4 (1.4690)** and **Rule 8 (1.4150)** are significantly higher than the **reference lift** ([1.2048, 1.0559]), suggesting these rules have a stronger association.

3. **Support Values**:
   - The **current rules' support** varies widely, with some rules (e.g., Rule 3) having **zero support** and others (e.g., Rule 2) having support similar to the reference.
   - Generally, support values are lower than the reference metrics, indicating that the current rules apply to fewer instances in the dataset.

**Conclusion on Current Performance:**

- **Strengths**:
  - **Rules 4 and 8** exhibit **high confidence and lift**, which suggests they are particularly effective at predicting outcomes when their conditions are met.
  - The overall lift values indicate that the current rules are useful and improve upon random guessing.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Some rules have **low support**, meaning they apply to very few cases and may not be generalizable.
  - **Rule 3** has **zero support**, indicating it's not applicable to any instances in the dataset and should be reconsidered.

---

**Assessment of Iterations and Local Minimum**

- **Local Minimum Consideration**:
  - The **fluctuations in confidence and lift** across the rules suggest that while some improvement has been made, the process may have reached a point where additional iterations yield diminishing returns.
  - The presence of **rules with high lift but low support** indicates a potential overfitting to specific instances.
- **Number of Iterations**:
  - Given that some rules are still showing significant improvements (e.g., high lift values in Rules 4 and 8), it may be beneficial to continue iterating.
  - However, attention should be paid to increasing support without compromising confidence and lift excessively.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Enhance Rule Support**:
   - **Merge or Generalize Rules**: Identify overlapping rules or those with similar conditions that can be combined to increase support.
     - For example, Rules focusing on **coordinating heteroatoms** could be generalized to include a broader range of functional groups.
   - **Broaden Conditions**: Slightly relax the specificity of some rules to cover more instances while maintaining reasonable confidence and lift.

2. **Eliminate Ineffective Rules**:
   - **Remove Rules with Zero or Negligible Support**: Rules like **Rule 3** do not contribute to the model and can be removed to simplify the rule set.
   - **Assess Low-confidence Rules**: Re-evaluate rules with confidence close to random chance (e.g., confidence around 0.5) for their practical utility.

3. **Focus on High-impact Rules**:
   - **Prioritize Rules with High Lift and Confidence**: Rules like **Rule 4 and Rule 8** should be emphasized as they have strong predictive power.
   - **Optimize These Rules**: Investigate whether these rules can be adjusted to cover more instances (increase support) without significantly reducing their lift and confidence.

4. **Balanced Rule Refinement**:
   - **Trade-off Between Metrics**: Aim for a balance where support is increased, but confidence and lift remain acceptable.
     - Slight reductions in confidence and lift may be acceptable if support increases significantly, making the rule more generalizable.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data or Features**:
   - **Feature Engineering**: Introduce new features or descriptors that may capture underlying patterns not currently represented.
     - For instance, consider electronic effects, steric parameters, or solvatochromic descriptors.
   - **Expand Dataset**: If possible, include more data points to provide a richer basis for rule generation and validation.

6. **Cross-validation and Testing**:
   - **Evaluate on Test Set**: Apply the rules to a separate test dataset to assess their generalizability.
   - **Adjust Based on Test Performance**: Rules that perform well on training data but poorly on test data may be overfitting.

7. **Iterative Pruning and Refinement**:
   - **Regularly Prune Rules**: Continuously remove or adjust rules that underperform to streamline the rule set.
   - **Monitor Metric Trends**: Keep track of how support, confidence, and lift change with each iteration to identify optimal stopping points.

8. **Incorporate Domain Expertise**:
   - **Consult Chemists or Domain Experts**: Use expert knowledge to refine rules, especially in understanding why certain modifiers lead to high or low yields.
   - **Consider Mechanistic Insights**: Integrate mechanistic understanding of the catalytic process to inform rule adjustments.

---

**Final Thoughts**

The current set of rules shows promising areas, particularly with rules that have high confidence and lift. However, the low support for many rules limits their applicability. By focusing on increasing support while maintaining acceptable levels of confidence and lift, the rules can become more robust and useful in practice.

Careful consideration should be given to eliminating ineffective rules and emphasizing those with strong predictive power. Incorporating additional data, refining existing rules, and leveraging domain expertise can further enhance the rules' performance.

Continuing iterations may be beneficial, but attention must be paid to avoid overfitting and ensure the rules remain generalizable. Balancing the metrics and focusing on practical applicability will lead to a more effective and reliable set of rules for predicting catalytic performance.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Comparison of Accuracies**

- **Previous Iterations**: The previous validation accuracies were consistently high, ranging from **68% to 76%**, with test accuracies of **62.5% to 75%**. This indicates that the rules in earlier iterations were capturing the underlying patterns in the data reasonably well.

  ```
  Previous Validation Accuracies:
  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75

  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625
  ```

- **Current Iteration**: In the latest iteration, the validation accuracy has dropped significantly to approximately **51.4%**.

  ```
  Current Validation Accuracy:
  - An accuracy of 0.5142857142857142 was obtained using classification model.
  ```

**2. Effectiveness of Current Rules**

- The substantial decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules is **less effective** at predicting the catalyst loading compared to previous iterations.

- The rules may not be adequately capturing the key features or relationships necessary for accurate predictions.

**3. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Underfitting**: The low validation accuracy indicates that the model is likely underfitting. This means it is too simplistic and fails to capture the complexity of the underlying data patterns.

- The model's inability to generalize well across different validation folds suggests that the current rules are not sufficiently expressive.

**4. Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insight into which rules contribute most to the model's predictions. By examining cases where the model's predictions disagree with the experimental values, we can identify problematic rules.

- **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High)**

  - **Molecules with Predicted Low but Experimental High Loading**:

    1. **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
    2. **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**
    3. **C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O**
    4. **C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)O**
    5. **C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O**

  - **Problematic Rules**:

    - **Rule 2**: This rule assigns **low yield** to modifiers that are α-amino acids with non-coordinating side chains. However, the SHAP values indicate that this rule is contributing to underestimations in cases where the experimental yield is high.

    - **Rule 3**: In some iterations, **Rule 3** had negative SHAP values for these molecules, suggesting it may also be contributing to the underprediction.

- **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low)**

  - **Molecules with Predicted High but Experimental Low Loading**:

    1. **C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F**
    2. **C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=NC=C2)C(=O)O**
    3. **COCCOCCOCC(=O)O**

  - **Problematic Rules**:

    - **Rule 1**: This rule assigns **high yield** to modifiers that are α-amino acids with coordinating heteroatoms in their side chains. The SHAP analysis shows that **Rule 1** contributes positively to the high predicted loading for molecules that experimentally have low loading.

    - **Rule 8**: This rule associates modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group with **high yield**. The SHAP values suggest it may be overestimating the loading in certain cases.

**5. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

- The decrease in validation accuracy over iterations suggests that the adjustments made to the rules may have led the model into a **local minimum**, where further changes are not improving performance.

- The lack of improvement indicates that the current rules may not be capturing critical features necessary for accurate predictions.

**6. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Consistent Misclassifications**: Certain molecules are consistently misclassified, indicating that specific rules are not accurately representing their characteristics.

- **Influential Rules**: Rules with high positive or negative SHAP values in misclassified instances are likely candidates for refinement.

  - **High Positive SHAP Values in Overestimations**: Rules contributing to overestimations (e.g., **Rule 1**, **Rule 8**) may be too broadly defined or not considering exceptions.

  - **High Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations**: Rules contributing to underestimations (e.g., **Rule 2**, **Rule 3**) may be overly restrictive or not accounting for additional factors that influence yield.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Problematic Rules**

- **Rule 1 (High Yield Modifiers with Coordinating Side Chains)**

  - **Issue**: Overestimation in cases where the side chains may not effectively coordinate due to steric hindrance or electronic factors.

  - **Suggestion**: Refine the rule by specifying the nature of the coordinating heteroatoms and considering steric and electronic effects. For example, limit to small side chains with readily accessible heteroatoms.

- **Rule 2 (Low Yield Modifiers with Non-Coordinating Side Chains)**

  - **Issue**: Underestimation for molecules that, despite having non-coordinating side chains, may still participate effectively due to other factors.

  - **Suggestion**: Modify the rule to consider additional structural features that might enhance coordination, such as proximity of the carboxyl group to other potential coordination sites.

- **Rule 8 (High Yield Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups)**

  - **Issue**: Overestimation when multiple hydroxyl groups do not enhance coordination due to spatial arrangement or interference from other groups.

  - **Suggestion**: Specify the required spatial arrangement of hydroxyl groups (e.g., diols adjacent to the carboxyl group) and consider potential steric hindrance.

- **Rule 3 (High Yield Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Coordinating Para-Substituents)**

  - **Issue**: Underestimation if the rule does not account for the activity of meta-substituted compounds or ortho effects.

  - **Suggestion**: Expand the rule to include other positions of substituents if they contribute to coordination, and consider the electronic effects of substituents.

**2. Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values**

- **Identify Additional Factors**: Examine molecules where predictions are underestimated and identify common features not accounted for in the current rules.

- **Incorporate Missing Features**: Modify the rules to include these features, ensuring they are based on chemical rationale.

**3. Improve Generalization**

- **Avoid Overgeneralization**: Ensure rules are not too broad, which can lead to misclassifications.

- **Enhance Specificity**: Add criteria to rules where necessary to capture complex behaviors (e.g., specify chain lengths, functional group positions).

**4. Address Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Balance Complexity**: Adjust the number and complexity of rules to prevent overfitting (too complex) or underfitting (too simple).

- **Cross-Validation**: Continue using cross-validation to assess the generalizability of the rules.

**5. Utilize SHAP Analysis Iteratively**

- **Rule Evaluation**: For each rule, assess its average SHAP value across correctly and incorrectly predicted cases.

- **Rule Modification**: Prioritize adjustments on rules with high SHAP contributions to misclassifications.

**6. Consider External Validation**

- **Additional Data**: If possible, validate the rules on an external dataset to test their predictive power beyond the current data.

**7. Incorporate Feedback Loops**

- **Iterative Refinement**: Implement a systematic approach to modify rules, retrain the model, and evaluate performance.

- **Record Changes**: Keep detailed records of rule changes and their impact on model performance to inform future iterations.

**Conclusion**

By carefully analyzing the performance of the current rules and their contributions to model predictions through SHAP analysis, we can identify specific rules that require refinement. Adjusting these rules to better capture the nuances of the molecular interactions involved in catalyst loading should improve the model's accuracy. Iterative refinement, guided by both chemical intuition and data-driven insights, will enhance the predictive power of the rules and lead to better generalization in future iterations.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

---

**1. Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**a. Rule Metrics Analysis**

- The current rules show varying levels of support, confidence, and lift.
- Some rules, such as **Rule 4** and **Rule 8**, exhibit high confidence and lift but have low support.
- **Rule 3** has zero support, indicating it does not apply to any instances in the dataset.
- The overall validation accuracy has decreased to approximately **51%**, compared to previous iterations that had accuracies around **68% to 76%**.
- The drop in accuracy suggests that the current rules may not be effectively capturing the key features necessary for accurate predictions.

**b. SHAP Analysis Insights**

- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values reveal which rules contribute most to the model's predictions.
- Certain molecules are consistently misclassified, indicating that specific rules are not accurately representing their characteristics.
- Rules with high positive or negative SHAP values in misclassified instances are likely contributing to prediction errors.

**c. Performance Insights**

- The current rules may be underfitting the data, failing to capture the complexity of the underlying patterns.
- Low support for many rules limits their applicability and generalizability.
- There is a potential for overfitting if rules are too specific or if low-support rules are overly emphasized.

---

**2. Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

**a. Revise and Refine SMARTS Patterns**

- **Revisit SMARTS Patterns for α-Amino Acids (Rules 1 and 2):**
  - The current SMARTS patterns might be too restrictive, missing important compounds like glutamic acid and aspartic acid.
  - **Action:** Use more general patterns to accurately detect α-amino acids with various side chains. For example, `'[NX3][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` can capture a broader range of α-amino acids.

- **Correct Side Chain Detection Logic:**
  - Ensure that the code properly identifies side chain atoms by excluding backbone atoms and capturing all atoms connected to the alpha carbon, excluding the nitrogen, alpha carbon itself, and the carboxyl group.

- **Enhance Traversal of Side Chains (Rule 1):**
  - Modify the traversal to comprehensively check all connected atoms for coordinating heteroatoms, ensuring that indirect connections are not missed.

**b. Improve Detection of Para-Substituted Aromatic Carboxylic Acids (Rules 3 and 4)**

- **Modify SMARTS Patterns:**
  - Use more precise SMARTS patterns to identify para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids. For instance, `'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O'` can be used to identify the benzoic acid moiety, and further patterns can specify para-substituents.

- **Improve Para-Substituent Identification:**
  - Implement methods to detect para-substituents based on atom indices or use SMARTS that inherently specify para-substitution.

**c. Adjust Logic for Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids (Rule 5)**

- **Use Broader SMARTS Patterns:**
  - The current pattern may be too narrow. Employ patterns like `'[nH0;!+0][#6]*[C](=O)[O,H]'` to match a wider range of heterocycles containing coordinating nitrogen atoms.

**d. Enhance Rule Support and Generalization**

- **Increase Support by Merging or Generalizing Rules:**
  - Combine overlapping rules to increase their applicability without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
  - For example, generalize rules that involve coordinating heteroatoms to cover more functional groups.

- **Broaden Rule Conditions Carefully:**
  - Slightly relax the specificity of rules to cover more instances, while monitoring the impact on performance metrics.

**e. Eliminate or Revise Ineffective Rules**

- **Remove Zero-Support Rules:**
  - Rules like **Rule 3** that have zero support should be reconsidered or removed to simplify the rule set.

- **Assess Low-Confidence Rules:**
  - Re-evaluate rules with confidence close to random chance (around 50%), as they may not be contributing meaningfully to the model.

**f. Focus on High-Impact Rules**

- **Emphasize Rules with High Lift and Confidence:**
  - Prioritize refining rules like **Rule 4** and **Rule 8**, which have strong predictive power but low support.
  - **Action:** Investigate ways to adjust these rules to cover more instances without substantially reducing their effectiveness.

**g. Implement Comprehensive Testing and Validation**

- **Add Unit Tests with Example Compounds:**
  - Use the provided examples for each rule to create unit tests, ensuring that the code correctly identifies intended compounds.

- **Utilize RDKit's Visualization and Debugging Tools:**
  - Leverage RDKit's capabilities to interactively test and refine SMARTS patterns, ensuring accurate matches with the target structures.

**h. Incorporate Detailed Logging and Error Handling**

- **Enhance Logging:**
  - Implement detailed logging to trace how molecules are matched to rules, aiding in debugging and refinement.

- **Improve Error Messages:**
  - Provide clear error messages when matches fail or exceptions occur, facilitating quicker identification of issues.

**i. Integrate Domain Expertise**

- **Consult Chemists or Domain Experts:**
  - Use expert knowledge to understand why certain modifiers lead to high or low yields, informing rule adjustments.

- **Consider Mechanistic Insights:**

**3. Possibility for Further Optimization**

Given the significant drop in validation accuracy and the insights from the SHAP analysis, there is clear evidence that the current rules are not adequately capturing the complexity of the data. The suggestions above provide concrete steps to refine and improve the rules without overfitting. By addressing specific issues in the SMARTS patterns, side chain detection, and rule generalization, it is possible to enhance the model's performance.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules demonstrate how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction:

- **High Yield Modifiers**: Contain functional groups capable of effective metal coordination (e.g., amino acids with coordinating side chains, heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen atoms, proximal thiol or hydroxyl groups). These features enhance metal-ligand interactions, leading to improved catalyst performance.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**: Lack coordinating groups, have functional groups that are too distant or hinder coordination (e.g., bulky substituents, distal amino or hydroxyl groups), or contain interfering functional groups (e.g., aldehydes, ketones, perfluoroalkyl chains). These factors weaken metal-ligand interactions or introduce steric and electronic effects that reduce catalytic efficiency.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield and can design new modifiers to optimize the reaction outcome based on their structural characteristics.---------------------------------------------------------------

12. **Modifiers that are medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (C6 to C8) without additional functional groups result in **high yield**.**

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **Octanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Medium-chain carboxylic acids have an optimal chain length that allows favorable interactions with the catalyst without introducing steric hindrance, enhancing yield.

---

13. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids linked via a flexible aliphatic chain to additional coordinating functional groups result in **high yield** when the chain length allows effective coordination.**

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: The flexible aliphatic chain positions the coordinating group appropriately to interact with the metal center, improving catalyst efficiency and increasing yield.

---

14. **Modifiers containing both electron-withdrawing groups and coordinating functional groups result in **high yield**.**

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxylate, while coordinating functional groups strengthen metal-ligand interactions, collectively improving catalytic activity.

---

15. **Modifiers with multiple methoxy groups on an aromatic ring and additional ketone groups result in **high yield**.**

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Methoxy and ketone groups may synergistically enhance coordination with the metal center, increasing catalytic efficiency.

These rules outline the relationship between specific structural features of molecular modifiers and the resulting yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - Contain coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol, hydroxyl) near the carboxylate.
  - Have electron-withdrawing substituents that enhance metal coordination.
  - Feature heterocyclic systems with nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metals.
  - Possess multiple coordinating sites that strengthen metal-ligand interactions.
  - Include medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without steric hindrance.
  - Incorporate flexible linkers that position coordinating groups effectively.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - Lack coordinating groups or have them positioned too far from the carboxylate.
  - Contain electron-donating substituents that reduce carboxylate acidity.
  - Feature bulky or flexible substituents that hinder effective coordination.
  - Have functional groups that may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions (e.g., adjacent carbonyls, thiol groups on aromatic rings).
  - Include strong electron-withdrawing groups that overly reduce electron density, weakening coordination (e.g., perfluorinated chains).

By applying these rules, researchers can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield and can design new modifiers to optimize the reaction outcome based on their structural characteristics. Combining multiple substructures and considering underlying physicochemical properties allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how molecular features influence catalytic performance.

  - **Benefit**: This will provide additional evidence to support or refute the rules, leading to a more reliable rule set.

- **Advice 10**: **Review and Update Rationales for Consistency and Depth**  
  Ensure that all rationales accurately reflect the underlying chemistry:
  - **Action**: Re-express rationales to provide consistent levels of detail and to correct any inaccuracies.
  - **Example**: For rules involving thiol groups, explain the specific reasons why thiols in certain positions hinder coordination (e.g., oxidative side reactions, reduced nucleophilicity).

- **Advice 11**: **Eliminate Redundant or Contradictory Rules**  
  Remove or modify rules that overlap excessively or contradict each other:
  - **Action**: Carefully review the rule set to identify redundancies.
  - **Example**: If **Rule 14** overlaps significantly with **Rule 2**, consider integrating them or specifying the differences more clearly.

- **Advice 12**: **Incorporate Stereochemistry Where Relevant**  
  While most rules focus on functional groups and chain length, stereochemistry can also influence yield:
  - **Action**: If stereochemical configurations affect metal coordination, include this in the relevant rules.
  - **Benefit**: This adds an additional layer of specificity and may improve predictive accuracy.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* is clear and allows for straightforward identification of high yield modifiers based on the presence of a carboxylic acid group with additional coordinating amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups within three atoms from the carboxyl group. The rule provides strong physical-chemical insight, emphasizing the enhancement of metal-ligand interactions due to nearby coordinating groups. It considers combinations of substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. With multiple supporting data points (e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid, gluconic acid), it has excellent coverage. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* aims to classify high yield modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups capable of coordinating with metals, such as amino and nitro groups. However, the inclusion of amino groups as electron-withdrawing is chemically inaccurate, as amino groups are electron-donating and decrease carboxylate acidity. This inconsistency affects the clarity and the physical-chemical insight of the rule. While it considers combinations of substructures and is supported by two data points (4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid), the misclassification of amino groups suggests the rule needs refinement for better accuracy.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* is clear in identifying high yield modifiers as heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination. The physical-chemical insight is solid, highlighting the role of nitrogen in strengthening metal-ligand interactions. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is well-supported by data points (e.g., nicotinic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. It strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* effectively identifies high yield modifiers as those with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group. The rule is clear and provides strong physical-chemical insight by explaining how additional coordination sites enhance metal binding. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., gluconic acid), ensuring good coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* is clear, specifying high yield modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted bromomethyl groups. The physical-chemical rationale is acceptable. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), which does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two supporting examples. This limits the rule's reliability and suggests a need for additional data or integration into a broader rule for better coverage.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* clearly identifies high yield modifiers as medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups. The rationale is satisfactory, citing optimal catalyst interaction without steric hindrance. However, only one data point (octanoic acid) supports the rule, failing the coverage criterion. The simplicity of the rule is balanced, but additional supporting examples are necessary to strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* clearly classifies low yield modifiers as aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, explaining the reduced effectiveness of distant functional groups in metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), fulfilling the coverage requirement and maintaining a good balance.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* effectively identifies low yield modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups. The rule is clear and provides solid physical-chemical insight into how electron-donating groups decrease carboxylate acidity. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* clearly identifies low yield modifiers containing carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group. The physical-chemical rationale is sound, discussing competition for metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is well-supported by data points (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid), meeting the coverage criterion and maintaining a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* is clear in identifying low yield modifiers as perfluorinated carboxylic acids. The physical-chemical rationale is acceptable. However, with only one supporting data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), it fails the coverage criterion. The specificity of the rule and lack of additional examples limit its applicability, suggesting a need for more data for validation.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* effectively classifies low yield modifiers with bulky substituents or flexible polyether chains near the carboxyl group. The rule is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight into steric hindrance effects. It considers combinations of structural features and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), satisfying the coverage requirement and maintaining a good balance.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* clearly identifies low yield modifiers as amino acids with hydrophobic or non-coordinating side chains. The physical-chemical rationale is adequate, explaining the lack of additional coordinating groups. The rule considers combinations of substructures and meets the coverage criterion with supporting data points (e.g., phenylalanine), maintaining a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* is clear in specifying low yield modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted thiol groups. While the physical-chemical insight is acceptable, only one data point (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid) supports the rule, failing the coverage criterion. The rule's specificity and limited data support suggest that additional examples are needed to strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* identifies high yield modifiers with multiple methoxy groups on an aromatic ring and an additional ketone group. The rule is specific and provides some physical-chemical insight into synergistic effects. However, it is supported by only one data point (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), which does not meet the coverage criterion. Additional supporting data are necessary for this rule to be reliable.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* broadly states that modifiers containing both electron-withdrawing groups and coordinating functional groups result in a high yield. The rule lacks clarity due to its generality, and while the physical-chemical rationale is acceptable, it is only supported by one data point (4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), failing the coverage criterion. The rule would benefit from refinement and additional examples to enhance its clarity and coverage.

  - **Action**: Revise Rule 2 to accurately reflect the electron-donating nature of amino groups. Remove amino groups from the list of electron-withdrawing substituents and adjust the rationale accordingly.

- **Advice 2**: **Merge and Refine Rules 2 and 8 for Clarity and Accuracy**

  - **Issue**: Both Rule 2 and Rule 8 address aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents but differ in the nature of substituents (electron-withdrawing vs. electron-donating), with inconsistencies in classification.
  - **Action**: Combine Rules 2 and 8 into a single, comprehensive rule that accurately distinguishes between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, providing clear guidelines on their effects on yield.
  - **Revised Rule**:
    - **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro (–NO₂), bromomethyl (–CH₂Br)) result in a **high yield**, while those with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino (–NH₂), methyl (–CH₃), methoxy (–OCH₃), hydroxyl (–OH)) result in a **low yield**.**
    - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase carboxylate acidity and enhance metal coordination, improving catalytic activity. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken coordination, reducing yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Improve Coverage by Adding Supporting Examples**

  - **Issue**: Several rules lack sufficient supporting data points (e.g., Rules 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, and 15), weakening their reliability.
  - **Action**: For each of these rules:
    - **Rule 5**: Identify additional examples of modifiers with para-substituted bromomethyl groups that result in high yield.
    - **Rule 6**: Find more medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups that result in high yield (e.g., hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid).
    - **Rule 10**: Seek additional examples of perfluorinated carboxylic acids resulting in low yield to strengthen the rule.
    - **Rule 13**: Locate more modifiers with para-substituted thiol groups that consistently lead to low yield.
    - **Rule 14 and 15**: Gather more data on modifiers with multiple methoxy groups and those containing both electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups to reinforce these rules.

- **Advice 4**: **Consolidate Similar Rules to Enhance Clarity**

  - **Issue**: Some rules overlap or are too specific, causing redundancy and potential confusion (e.g., Rules 5 and 15 both involve electron-withdrawing groups enhancing yield).
  - **Action**: Merge Rules 5 and 15 into a unified rule that emphasizes the positive impact of electron-withdrawing substituents coupled with coordinating groups on yield.
  - **Revised Rule**:
    - **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro (–NO₂), halogens) and coordinating functional groups (e.g., carbonyl (–C=O), halomethyl (–CH₂X)) result in a **high yield**.**

- **Advice 5**: **Address Conflicts Between Rules**

  - **Issue**: Rule 6 (medium-chain aliphatic acids result in high yield) may conflict with Rule 7 (functional groups distant from carboxylate result in low yield).
  - **Action**: Clarify the distinction between the rules by specifying that Rule 6 applies to unfunctionalized aliphatic carboxylic acids, while Rule 7 pertains to aliphatic acids with distant functional groups that fail to coordinate effectively.
  - **Adjustment**:
    - **Rule 6**: Emphasize that unfunctionalized medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids result in high yield due to optimal chain length for catalyst interaction.
    - **Rule 7**: Specify that aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups beyond three carbons from the carboxylate result in low yield due to ineffective coordination.

- **Advice 6**: **Enhance Rule 12 for Better Coverage**

  - **Issue**: Rule 12 focuses on amino acids with hydrophobic or non-coordinating side chains resulting in low yield but could be expanded for broader applicability.
  - **Action**: Extend the rule to include all modifiers lacking coordinating groups near the carboxylate, consolidating with similar rules addressing the absence of nearby coordinating functionalities.
  - **Revised Rule**:
    - **Modifiers lacking coordinating functional groups near the carboxylate, including amino acids with non-coordinating side chains, result in a **low yield**.**

- **Advice 7**: **Ensure Each Rule Meets Coverage Criteria**

  - **Issue**: Some rules do not meet the minimum of two supporting examples required for adequate coverage.
  - **Action**: Review each rule to confirm it is supported by at least two examples. If not, either supplement the rule with additional data or consider integrating it into a broader rule where applicable.

- **Advice 8**: **Summarize and Organize Rules for Improved Clarity**

  - **Issue**: The current rules could be better organized to reduce redundancy and enhance understanding.
  - **Action**: Group rules based on common features such as electronic effects (electron-withdrawing vs. electron-donating groups) and presence or absence of coordinating groups near the carboxylate. Provide clear headings or categories for each group to improve navigability.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Exceptions and Address Conflicting Data**

  - **Issue**: Some data points may not fit neatly into the proposed rules, leading to exceptions or apparent contradictions.
  - **Action**: Identify any such exceptions and explicitly address them within the rules or rationales. Provide explanations for anomalies, such as steric effects, resonance stabilization, or competing reactions that may influence yield contrary to expectations.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Rules Using Additional Data**

  - **Issue**: The reliability of the rules depends on the breadth and quality of supporting data.
  - **Action**: Collect more experimental data on a wider variety of modifiers to test the proposed rules. Use this data to refine the rules further, ensuring they are robust and predictive across a broader range of compounds.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Rule Coverage by Adding Supporting Examples**

  - **Issue**: Several rules (e.g., Rules 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15) are supported by only one data point, which weakens their reliability and applicability.
  - **Recommendation**: For each rule, provide at least two supporting examples from the dataset or additional research to meet the coverage criterion. This will strengthen the rules and increase confidence in their predictive power.

- **Advice 2**: **Correct Chemical Inaccuracies in Rule 2**

  - **Issue**: Rule 2 incorrectly classifies amino groups (–NH₂) as electron-withdrawing when they are electron-donating groups, leading to confusion and potential misprediction.
  - **Recommendation**: Revise Rule 2 to reflect the correct electron-donating nature of amino groups. If amino-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids still result in high yield due to other factors (e.g., coordination ability), adjust the rationale to emphasize those aspects instead of misclassifying amino groups.

- **Advice 3**: **Merge Overlapping Rules to Reduce Redundancy**

  - **Issue**: Rules 5 and 15 both address modifiers with specific structural features leading to high yield but are presented separately, causing redundancy.
  - **Recommendation**: Combine overlapping rules into a single, more general rule that encompasses the shared structural motifs and rationales. This will improve clarity and make the rules more concise and easier to apply.

- **Advice 4**: **Address Exceptions and Conflicting Data**

  - **Issue**: Some rules do not account for exceptions, such as compounds that defy expected outcomes based on their functional groups (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid resulting in high yield despite the amino group being electron-donating).
  - **Recommendation**: Refine the rules to include conditions or additional factors that account for these exceptions. Consider the overall molecular context, such as the presence of multiple coordinating groups or steric factors that may influence the outcome.

- **Advice 5**: **Expand the Dataset for Better Rule Validation**

  - **Issue**: Limited data points, especially for rules with only one supporting example, reduce the robustness of the rules.
  - **Recommendation**: Increase the number of modifiers in the dataset by including additional compounds with similar structural features. This will allow for better validation and refinement of the rules based on a more comprehensive set of data.

- **Advice 6**: **Increase Specificity with Quantitative Descriptors**

  - **Issue**: Some rules use qualitative terms like "near" or "distant," which can lead to ambiguity in rule application.
  - **Recommendation**: Define quantitative parameters, such as the exact number of atoms separating functional groups from the carboxyl group (e.g., "within three atoms"), to enhance clarity and precision in the rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Integrate Steric and Electronic Effects in Rules**

  - **Issue**: Current rules often address steric hindrance and electronic effects separately, potentially overlooking the interplay between these factors.
  - **Recommendation**: Develop rules that consider both steric and electronic factors simultaneously. For example, specify how bulky electron-donating groups near the carboxyl group may differently impact yield compared to smaller groups.

- **Advice 8**: **Utilize Computational Analysis for Rule Refinement**

  - **Issue**: Without systematic analysis, important structural patterns influencing yield may be overlooked.
  - **Recommendation**: Apply cheminformatics tools and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis to identify common substructures and properties among high-yielding and low-yielding modifiers. Use these insights to refine existing rules or create new, evidence-based rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Ensure Consistent Terminology and Definitions**

  - **Issue**: Inconsistent use of terms like "bulky," "flexible," or "near" can lead to misunderstandings.
  - **Recommendation**: Establish clear definitions for all terms used in the rules. For instance, define "bulky substituents" based on molecular volume or steric parameters and specify the maximum number of atoms considered "near" the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 10**: **Review and Strengthen Rule Rationales**

  - **Issue**: Some rationales lack depth or contain inaccuracies, reducing the explanatory power of the rules.
  - **Recommendation**: Reevaluate the rationales for each rule to ensure they align with chemical principles and the observed data. Provide detailed explanations that accurately reflect how the structural features influence metal coordination and catalytic activity.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Functional Group Presence**  
  Convert qualitative descriptions of functional groups into quantitative features. For example, instead of stating "modifiers with nearby amino groups result in high yield," define a numerical feature like "count of amino nitrogen atoms within three bonds of the carboxyl group." This allows for the creation of a numeric feature matrix directly from SMILES strings.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints**  
  Employ cheminformatics tools to calculate molecular descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, logP, topological polar surface area) and generate molecular fingerprints from the SMILES representations of the modifiers. These descriptors can serve as inputs for statistical models and help quantify the effects of different structural features on the yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Implement Substructure Pattern Matching with SMARTS**  
  Define the rules using SMARTS patterns to identify specific substructures within the modifiers. This method enables precise detection of functional groups and structural motifs directly from SMILES codes, facilitating the generation of a feature matrix based on the presence or absence of these patterns.

- **Advice 4**: **Simplify and Generalize Rules**  
  Consolidate overlapping rules to reduce complexity and improve clarity. For instance, combine rules that involve electron-withdrawing groups enhancing yield into a single generalized rule. This simplification helps in creating broader categories that are easier to quantify and model.

- **Advice 5**: **Define Topological Distances Numerically**  
  Specify "near the carboxyl group" in terms of topological distance within the molecule (e.g., within three bonds). Encode this information numerically to create features that capture the proximity of functional groups to the carboxyl group, making it easier to include in a numeric matrix.

- **Advice 6**: **Use One-Hot Encoding for Functional Groups**  
  Apply one-hot encoding to represent the presence or absence of specific functional groups near the carboxyl group. For example, create binary features for amino groups, hydroxyl groups, thiol groups, and electron-withdrawing or donating substituents. This method transforms categorical structural information into numerical form suitable for modeling.

- **Advice 7**: **Include Steric and Electronic Parameters**  
  Incorporate quantifiable steric (e.g., molar refractivity, steric hindrance indices) and electronic parameters (e.g., Hammett sigma constants, Mulliken charges) into the feature set. These parameters help in quantifying the effects of substituents on the reactivity and coordination ability of the modifiers.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Metal-Binding Affinity Metrics**  
  Calculate or obtain metal-binding affinity descriptors for the modifiers, such as chelation energies or stability constants. These metrics directly relate to the modifier's ability to coordinate with the metal center and can significantly influence the yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Automate Feature Extraction with Cheminformatics Software**  
  Utilize software tools like RDKit or Open Babel to automate the extraction of structural features and calculate molecular descriptors from the SMILES strings. Automation increases efficiency and consistency in data processing, making it easier to build and update the feature matrix.

- **Advice 10**: **Apply Machine Learning for Rule Refinement**  
  Use machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and identify patterns or relationships that may not be apparent through manual rule creation. Techniques like decision trees or random forests can help generate rules based on feature importance and interactions, leading to a more robust predictive model.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing an amino group (–NH₂) within three atoms of the carboxyl group and at least one additional coordinating group (e.g., a second carboxylate or hydroxyl group) result in a **high yield**.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: The presence of an amino group close to the carboxylate enhances metal coordination through chelation. Additional coordinating groups like a second carboxylate or hydroxyl further strengthen metal-ligand interactions, increasing catalytic efficiency and yield.

---

2. **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted electron-withdrawing coordinating group**, such as amino (–NH₂) or nitro (–NO₂), result in a **high yield**.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups at the para position increase the acidity of the carboxylate group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. The coordinating substituents facilitate stronger metal-ligand interactions, improving catalytic activity.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as additional coordination sites, promoting stronger binding with metal ions. This enhances the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex and increases the reaction yield.

---

4. **Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**.**

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate provide additional sites for hydrogen bonding and metal coordination. This enhances the overall interaction with the metal center, leading to improved catalytic performance.

---

5. **Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 to 8 carbons) without additional bulky functional groups** result in a **high yield**.**

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **Octanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Medium-chain acids have optimal hydrophobicity that allows favorable interaction with the catalyst surface without causing steric hindrance. This facilitates effective metal coordination and enhances catalytic efficiency.

---

6. **Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with sulfur-containing functional groups (e.g., thiol, thioether) within three atoms of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**.**

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Sulfur atoms are good ligands for metal coordination due to their lone pair electrons. The proximity of the thiol group to the carboxylate increases the likelihood of forming strong metal-ligand bonds, improving catalyst activity.

---

7. **Modifiers that **combine electron-withdrawing groups and coordinating functional groups** result in a **high yield**.**

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups like bromomethyl increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination. The combined effect of acidity and coordination strengthens the interaction with the metal center, leading to higher yields.

---

8. **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted electron-donating group**, such as methyl (–CH₃) or methoxy (–OCH₃), result in a **low yield**.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with metal ions. This leads to weaker metal-ligand interactions and lower catalytic activity.

---

9. **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than three carbon atoms away from the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Functional groups distant from the carboxylate are less effective in participating in metal coordination. The lack of proximity reduces the potential for chelation, leading to weaker interactions and diminished catalytic performance.

---

10. **Modifiers containing **bulky or flexible polar substituents near the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Bulky or flexible substituents can introduce steric hindrance and conformational flexibility, which interfere with effective metal coordination. This reduces the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex and lowers the reaction yield.

---

11. **Modifiers with **adjacent carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) to the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate can form intramolecular interactions or compete for metal coordination. This can disrupt the optimal binding of the modifier to the metal center, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

---

12. **Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids** result in a **low yield**.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Perfluorination introduces strong electron-withdrawing effects, significantly reducing electron density on the carboxylate oxygen atoms. This weakens metal-ligand coordination and decreases catalytic activity.

---

13. **Modifiers that are **amino acids with non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains** result in a **low yield**.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

    - **Rationale**: Hydrophobic side chains lacking polar or coordinating groups do not contribute to metal coordination. The absence of additional coordination sites leads to weaker interactions with the metal center and lower yields.

---

14. **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted thiol group** result in a **low yield**.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Convert Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Descriptors**

  Revise the current rules to incorporate molecular descriptors that can be quantified directly from SMILES strings. For example, instead of qualitative terms like "nearby," specify exact distances in terms of the number of bonds or atoms between functional groups. This will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Define Specific Structural Features Using SMARTS Patterns**

  Utilize SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to define structural features explicitly. Rewrite the rules to include SMARTS patterns for functional groups and substructures, allowing for precise identification and quantification of features in the molecules.

- **Advice 3**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions**

  Create a standardized list of functional groups and structural motifs relevant to the reaction's yield. Assign numerical values based on the presence or count of these groups in each modifier. This standardization will help in translating the rules into numeric data.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptor Calculations**

  Use cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit) to calculate molecular descriptors such as the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, topological polar surface area, logP, and molecular weight. Integrate these descriptors into the rules to allow quantitative analysis.

- **Advice 5**: **Quantify Electron-Withdrawing and Electron-Donating Effects**

  Assign numerical values to electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups based on Hammett sigma constants or other electronic parameters. Modify the rules to include these quantitative measures to assess their impact on yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Specify Coordination Numbers and Chelation Ability**

  Quantify the coordination ability of modifiers by counting the number of potential coordinating atoms (e.g., N, O, S) within a specified distance from the carboxyl group. Update the rules to reflect numerical thresholds for high yield based on these counts.

- **Advice 7**: **Include Steric Hindrance Parameters**

  Incorporate steric parameters such as the Taft steric parameter or Van der Waals volume to quantify the bulkiness of substituents near the carboxyl group. Adjust the rules to use these quantitative values to predict low yield due to steric hindrance.

- **Advice 8**: **Use Distance Metrics Between Functional Groups**

  Define the spatial relationship between functional groups numerically, such as the number of atoms or bonds separating them. Update rules like "functional groups within three atoms" to "functional groups separated by two bonds," enabling precise numerical coding.

- **Advice 9**: **Categorize Modifiers Based on Molecular Frameworks**

  Group modifiers into categories based on identifiable molecular frameworks (e.g., aliphatic chains, aromatic rings, heterocycles). Assign categorical numerical values to these frameworks to aid in feature matrix construction.

- **Advice 10**: **Implement Binary Flags for Key Structural Features**

  For each important structural feature identified in the rules (e.g., presence of an amino group adjacent to a carboxyl group), create a binary flag (1 for presence, 0 for absence). This simplifies the incorporation of features into a numeric matrix.

- **Advice 11**: **Quantify Hydrophobicity and Hydrophilicity**

  Calculate hydrophobicity parameters like logP for each modifier. Adjust rules involving hydrophobic interactions to include specific logP value ranges associated with high or low yields.

- **Advice 12**: **Revise Rules to Reflect Quantitative Thresholds**

  Where possible, set numerical thresholds for descriptors correlating with yields (e.g., "Modifiers with a topological polar surface area above X Å² result in high yield"). This enables direct translation into numerical data.

- **Advice 13**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**

  Review and consolidate rules that may overlap or cause redundancy. Simplify the rules to focus on the most impactful and quantifiable features, reducing complexity in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 14**: **Provide Examples with Quantified Features**

  Update examples in the rules to include the calculated numerical values of the descriptors used. This aids in understanding how the qualitative descriptions translate into quantitative data.

- **Advice 15**: **Validate and Refine Rules Using Statistical Analysis**

  Use statistical methods (e.g., correlation analysis, regression modeling) on existing data to identify which quantitative descriptors significantly impact yield. Refine the rules based on these findings to improve predictive accuracy.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Functional Groups and Structural Features**

  Modify the current rules to include specific numerical counts of functional groups and structural features that can be directly extracted from the SMILES representations. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a high yield," specify the exact number and position of hydroxyl groups (e.g., "Modifiers with at least three hydroxyl groups attached to adjacent carbons near the carboxyl group result in a high yield"). This quantification enables the creation of numerical feature vectors.

- **Advice 2**: **Develop a Numerical Feature Matrix Using Molecular Descriptors**

  Generate a comprehensive set of molecular descriptors for each modifier using cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit). Descriptors can include:

  - **Chemical Composition**: Counts of atoms (C, H, O, N, S, F, etc.).
  - **Functional Group Counts**: Number of specific functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, etc.).
  - **Topological Descriptors**: Molecular weight, number of rotatable bonds, ring count, etc.
  - **Electronic Descriptors**: Partial charges, electron distribution indices.
  - **Steric Descriptors**: Molar refractivity, topological polar surface area (TPSA).

  This numerical feature matrix will facilitate statistical analyses and machine learning models to predict yields.

- **Advice 3**: **Standardize and Simplify the Rules Using Measurable Parameters**

  Refine the rules by focusing on measurable parameters such as:

  - **Hydrogen Bond Donors and Acceptors**: Specify thresholds for the number of donors/acceptors.
  - **Log P (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient)**: Use Log P values to quantify hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity.
  - **pKa Values**: Include acidity/basicity as numerical values affecting coordination ability.
  - **Steric Hindrance Indicators**: Quantify steric bulk using descriptors like Van der Waals volume.

  For example, replace "Electron-withdrawing groups increase carboxylate acidity" with "Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups resulting in a carboxylate pKa less than X contribute to high yield."

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Machine Learning to Derive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR)**

  Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze the numerical feature matrix and derive QSAR models. These models can identify the most significant molecular features influencing the yield, leading to more precise and data-driven rules.

  - **Feature Selection**: Use algorithms to select the most predictive descriptors.
  - **Model Development**: Implement regression or classification models to predict yields.
  - **Rule Extraction**: Translate model findings into refined rules based on quantitative thresholds.

- **Advice 5**: **Use Hierarchical Clustering to Group Similar Modifiers**

  Perform hierarchical clustering of modifiers based on their numerical descriptors to identify groups associated with high or low yields. This can reveal underlying patterns not evident from qualitative rules and assist in formulating rules that capture these patterns.

- **Advice 6**: **Employ Structural Alerts and SMARTS Patterns**

  Define SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to identify specific substructures associated with high or low yields. By programming these patterns, you can automatically screen modifiers and assign yield predictions based on the presence or absence of certain structural motifs.

- **Advice 7**: **Adjust Rules to Reflect Quantitative Thresholds**

  Where possible, adjust the existing rules to include quantitative thresholds. For example:

  - **Chain Length**: Specify exact carbon chain lengths (e.g., "Modifiers with carbon chains of length 8 yield high results").
  - **Position of Functional Groups**: Use numerical positions relative to the carboxyl group (e.g., "Modifiers with amino groups within two bonds of the carboxyl group").

- **Advice 8**: **Validate and Update Rules with Additional Data**

  Gather more experimental data to validate the refined rules. Use cross-validation techniques to assess the accuracy of the rules and update them accordingly. This iterative process will enhance the reliability of the rules over time.

- **Advice 9**: **Consider Electronic and Steric Effects Quantitatively**

  Incorporate quantitative measures of electronic effects (e.g., Hammett sigma constants) and steric effects (e.g., Taft steric parameters) for substituents. This provides a numerical basis for rules involving electron-donating or -withdrawing groups and steric hindrance.

- **Advice 10**: **Provide Clear Definitions for Terms Used in Rules**

  Ensure that all terms in the rules are clearly defined and can be measured or calculated. Ambiguous terms like "bulky," "near," or "flexible" should be replaced with specific criteria (e.g., "Modifiers with substituents having a molar volume greater than X cm³/mol within three bonds of the carboxyl group").

---

12. **Modifiers that are amino acids with non-coordinating hydrophobic or aromatic side chains result in a low yield.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

    - **Rationale**: Side chains lacking additional coordinating functional groups provide minimal interaction with the metal center, leading to weaker catalyst-modifier binding and lower yields.

---

13. **Modifiers containing amide linkages or peptide bonds near the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---

14. **Modifiers with highly conjugated aromatic systems or multiple electron-donating substituents result in a low yield.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Extensive conjugation and electron-donating groups delocalize electron density, reducing the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, and thus decreasing the overall yield.

---

15. **Modifiers combining electron-withdrawing groups with additional coordinating functional groups result in a high yield.**

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Perfluorination** reducing electron density on the carboxylate (Rule 11).
  - **Non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains** in amino acids (Rule 12).
  - **Amide linkages or peptide bonds** near the carboxylate disrupting coordination (Rule 13).
  - **Highly conjugated systems or multiple electron-donating groups** decreasing carboxylate acidity and coordination (Rule 14).
  - **Aromatic thiol groups** less available for coordination due to delocalization or oxidation (Rule 5, Low Yield example).

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. This aids in the selection or design of modifiers to optimize the catalytic performance of the Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe) system in the target reaction.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for accurate prediction of high yield when the modifier is an amino acid with an amino group near the carboxyl group (α or β position). The rule provides strong physical-chemical insight by explaining the role of bidentate coordination in enhancing catalytic activity. It considers a combination of functional groups, fulfilling the complexity criterion, and is well-supported by multiple data points (entries 0, 2, 3, 15), satisfying coverage.
- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and effectively predicts high yield for aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating para-substituents. The rule offers solid chemical insight into how such substituents enhance acidity and coordination ability, thus improving catalytic performance. It encompasses combinations of functional groups and positions, meeting the complexity requirement, and is supported by at least three data points (entries 1, 4, 21), ensuring good coverage.
- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly states that heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination result in high yield. The property insight is strong, explaining how nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites. The rule considers a combination of a heterocycle and coordinating atoms (complexity) and is backed by sufficient data points (entries 8, 16, 22), meeting the coverage criterion.
- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 provides clear guidance that modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group lead to high yield. The rule offers good physical-chemical insight by highlighting chelation through multiple hydroxyl interactions. It considers a combination of functional groups (polyols and carboxylate), satisfying complexity, and is supported by data entries 6 and 9, which is acceptable coverage.
- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in differentiating between aliphatic thiol-containing modifiers (high yield) and aromatic thiol-containing modifiers (low yield). The rule provides insightful rationale regarding the availability of the thiol group's lone pair for metal coordination. It considers both the functional group and the structural context (complexity) and is supported by data entries 10 (low yield) and 18 (high yield), satisfying coverage.
- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in stating that medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without bulky substituents result in high yield. The property insight regarding optimal chain length enhancing interactions is reasonable. However, the rule lacks sufficient coverage, as it is primarily supported by a single data point (entry 5). This limits the rule's robustness according to the coverage criterion.
- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly predicts low yield for aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups. The chemical insight about decreased acidity affecting coordination ability is sound. The rule involves specific functional groups and positions (complexity) and is supported by entries 23 and 30, satisfying the coverage requirement.
- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly indicates that modifiers with functional groups distant from the carboxyl group result in low yield. The physical-chemical rationale regarding decreased coordination effectiveness is valid. The rule considers both the presence and position of functional groups (complexity) and is well-supported by multiple data points (entries 29, 31, 34), ensuring good coverage.
- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and effectively predicts low yield for modifiers with bulky or flexible side chains near the carboxyl group. The rule provides solid insight into steric hindrance affecting coordination. It considers structural complexity and is supported by data entries 11 and 32, meeting the coverage criterion.
- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly states that modifiers with additional carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group lead to low yield. The property insight about competition for metal coordination is compelling. The rule demonstrates complexity by considering functional group adjacency and is backed by sufficient data points (entries 19, 20, 27), satisfying coverage.
- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear in predicting low yield for perfluorinated carboxylic acids. The rationale regarding decreased electron density is acceptable. However, the rule lacks adequate coverage, as it is based on a single data point (entry 14), limiting its reliability.
- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 lacks clarity due to inconsistency with the data. While it predicts low yield for amino acids with non-coordinating hydrophobic or aromatic side chains (supported by entry 13), it contradicts entry 15 (tryptophan), which has an aromatic side chain yet results in high yield. This suggests the rule may require refinement, and the property insight may be oversimplified. Coverage is also limited.
- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and accurately predicts low yield for modifiers containing amide linkages or peptide bonds near the carboxyl group. The property insight about interference with metal coordination is strong. The rule considers specific structural features (complexity) and is supported by multiple data points (entries 24, 26, 33), ensuring good coverage.
- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear in linking low yield to modifiers with highly conjugated aromatic systems or multiple electron-donating substituents. The chemical insight is reasonable. However, the rule's coverage is limited to a single data point (entry 12), reducing its robustness according to the coverage criterion.
- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 suggests that modifiers combining electron-withdrawing groups with additional coordinating functional groups result in high yield. While the property insight is valid, the rule lacks sufficient coverage, being primarily supported by a single data point (entry 1). This limits its strength under the coverage criterion.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are amino acids with an amino group near the carboxyl group result in a high yield, especially when the amino group is on the alpha or beta carbon.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Amino groups located near the carboxylate allow for chelation, forming bidentate coordination with the metal center. This enhances catalytic activity by stabilizing the metal and facilitating electron transfer.

---

2. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups at the para position result in a high yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal. Coordinating groups like amino or halogens can further stabilize the metal center through additional interactions.

---

3. **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination result in a high yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites for the metal, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing electron transfer processes essential for high catalytic activity.

---

4. **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxyl group result in a high yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Polyol groups can chelate the metal center through multiple hydroxyl interactions, enhancing stability and reactivity of the catalyst.

---

5. **Modifiers containing a thiol group (–SH) adjacent to the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in a high yield; however, thiol groups attached to an aromatic ring result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: In aliphatic compounds, thiol groups near the carboxylate strongly coordinate with metals due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur, enhancing catalytic activity. In aromatic compounds, the thiol group's lone pair can delocalize into the ring, reducing its availability for metal coordination.

---

6. **Modifiers that are medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 to 8 carbons) without bulky substituents result in a high yield.**

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **Octanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: The optimal chain length improves hydrophobic interactions without causing steric hindrance, facilitating effective interaction with the catalyst's active site.

---

7. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups, such as methyl (–CH₃) or methoxy (–OCH₃), result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal center, thus reducing catalytic efficiency.

---

8. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located on distant carbons (more than three carbon atoms away from the carboxyl group) result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with the metal center due to increased flexibility and distance, resulting in lower catalytic activity.

---

9. **Modifiers with flexible, bulky, or heavily substituted side chains near the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Bulky and flexible substituents can create steric hindrance, preventing the carboxyl group from effectively coordinating with the metal center and thus diminishing catalytic performance.

---

10. **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can either compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or form intramolecular interactions that disrupt optimal binding to the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.

---

11. **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in a low yield.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: The presence of highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduces the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal center and decreasing catalytic activity.

---

12. **Modifiers that are amino acids with non-coordinating hydrophobic or aromatic side chains result in a low yield.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

    - **Rationale**: Side chains lacking additional coordinating functional groups provide minimal interaction with the metal center, leading to weaker catalyst-modifier binding and lower yields.

---

13. **Modifiers containing amide linkages or peptide bonds near the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Amide groups can compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, interfering with effective binding to the metal center and diminishing catalytic efficiency.

---

14. **Modifiers with highly conjugated aromatic systems or multiple electron-donating substituents result in a low yield.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Extensive conjugation and electron-donating groups delocalize electron density, reducing the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, and thus decreasing the overall yield.

---

15. **Modifiers combining electron-withdrawing groups with additional coordinating functional groups result in a high yield.**

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group, while additional coordinating functional groups facilitate stronger metal binding, synergistically improving catalytic activity.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules establish a relationship between specific combinations of functional groups in molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction:

- **High Yield Modifiers** often contain:

  - **Proximal amino groups** near the carboxylate for bidentate coordination (Rule 1).
  - **Aromatic rings** with electron-withdrawing or coordinating para-substituents (Rule 2).
  - **Heterocycles with nitrogen atoms** that serve as additional coordination sites (Rule 3).
  - **Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups** enabling chelation (Rule 4).
  - **Aliphatic thiol groups** adjacent to the carboxylate enhancing metal coordination (Rule 5).
  - **Optimal chain lengths** without bulky substituents for better interaction with the catalyst (Rule 6).
  - **Combinations of electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups** to enhance metal binding (Rule 15).

- **Low Yield Modifiers** typically have:

  - **Electron-donating groups** that reduce carboxylate acidity (Rule 7).
  - **Functional groups distant from the carboxylate**, limiting coordination (Rule 8).
  - **Bulky or flexible substituents** causing steric hindrance (Rule 9).
  - **Adjacent carbonyl groups** competing for metal coordination (Rule 10).
  - **Perfluorination** reducing electron density on the carboxylate (Rule 11).
  - **Non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains** in amino acids (Rule 12).
  - **Amide linkages or peptide bonds** near the carboxylate disrupting coordination (Rule 13).
  - **Highly conjugated systems or multiple electron-donating groups** decreasing carboxylate acidity and coordination (Rule 14).
  - **Aromatic thiol groups** less available for coordination due to delocalization or oxidation (Rule 5, Low Yield example).

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. This aids in the selection or design of modifiers to optimize the catalytic performance of the Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe) system in the target reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 12 to accurately match amino acids with non-coordinating hydrophobic or aromatic side chains**. The current pattern `non_coordinating_amino_acid = '[NX3H2][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` is too general and matches any amino acid, including those with coordinating side chains. To specifically target amino acids like phenylalanine with hydrophobic or aromatic side chains, modify the pattern to include a side chain that is an aromatic ring or a hydrophobic group without coordinating functionalities. For example:
  
  ```python
  non_coordinating_amino_acid = '[NX3H2][CX4][CX4;$([CX4][C;H3,H2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1])][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```
  
  This pattern ensures that the side chain is an aliphatic or aromatic group without additional functional groups capable of metal coordination.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 2 to correctly identify para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups**. The current pattern may be too restrictive or incorrectly specified. A revised pattern could be:

  ```python
  ewg_para = '[c]1ccc([$(c[F,Cl,Br,I]),$(c[NX3](=O)=O),$(c[NX3H2]),$(c[OX2H])])cc1[C](=O)[O][H]'
  ```
  
  This pattern targets a benzene ring with a substituent at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid, where the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group or a coordinating group.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Broaden the SMARTS pattern for Rule 3 to capture a wider range of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids**. The current pattern `heterocyclic_carboxylic_acid = '[n][c][c](=O)[OX2H1]'` may miss other relevant structures. A more inclusive pattern could be:

  ```python
  heterocyclic_carboxylic_acid = '[nX2;r5,r6][#6;a]~[#6;a]~[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```
  
  This pattern matches nitrogen-containing heterocycles (5- or 6-membered rings) attached to a carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Modify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 6 to include medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with 6 to 8 carbons**. The current pattern only matches a specific chain length. Adjust it to:

  ```python
  medium_chain_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4]([CX4])[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]'
  ```
  
  Alternatively, use a recursive pattern to match chains of varying lengths:

  ```python
  medium_chain_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4]([CX4]){4,6}'
  ```
  
  This pattern matches aliphatic chains with 6 to 8 carbons including the carboxylic carbon.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Revise the SMARTS pattern for Rule 8 to accurately detect functional groups located more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group**. The current pattern may only match specific cases. A general pattern could be:

  ```python
  distant_functional_group = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4,CR0][*][NX3H2,OX2H]'
  ```
  
  This pattern ensures that the functional group (amino or hydroxyl) is located at least four carbons away from the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Improve the SMARTS pattern for Rule 9 to capture bulky or heavily substituted side chains near the carboxyl group**. The current pattern might not be sufficient. A more effective pattern could be:

  ```python
  bulky_substituent = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][CX4]([!H0])[!H0]'
  ```
  
  This pattern looks for a carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group that is bonded to two or more non-hydrogen atoms, indicating bulkiness or heavy substitution.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Ensure the SMARTS patterns for both high and low yield cases in Rule 5 correctly differentiate between aliphatic and aromatic thiols**. The patterns could be:

  ```python
  # High yield (aliphatic thiol adjacent to carboxyl group)
  thiol_adjacent = '[SX2H][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  
  # Low yield (aromatic thiol)
  aromatic_thiol = '[c][SX2H]'
  ```
  
  Verify that these patterns correctly identify the intended structures in the dataset.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Differentiate the SMARTS patterns for Rule 2 and Rule 15 to prevent overlap and ensure accurate matching**. If both rules share the same pattern, it may cause confusion. For Rule 15, consider a pattern that specifically looks for modifiers combining electron-withdrawing groups with additional coordinating functional groups:

  ```python
  ewg_coordinating = '[c]1ccc([$(c[F,Cl,Br,I]),$(c[NX3](=O)=O),$(c[OX2H])])[c][c]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```
  
  This pattern can be adjusted to exclude cases captured by Rule 2 if necessary.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Re-express patterns resulting in many zeros to be less restrictive and more reflective of the natural language rules**. For example, consider using wildcard characters or recursive SMARTS to capture broader classes of molecules that fit the rules.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Validate the SMILES strings against the rules to ensure they are appropriate examples for matching**. Some SMILES may not correspond to the structures intended for the rules. Adjust the dataset or provide alternative examples that better fit the criteria specified in the rules.

**Performance Analysis of Current Rules Based on Current Metrics**

**Overview**

The current rules have been evaluated using the provided metrics, focusing on **confidence** and **lift**, as per your request. We have also compared these metrics with the reference metrics from the previous rule matrices to assess the performance and determine if a local minimum has been reached.

---

**Comparison with Previous Metrics**

*Reference Metrics (Averages calculated from previous rule metrics):*

- **Train Support**: Approximately **0.1756**
- **Train Confidence**: Approximately **0.5874**
- **Train Lift**: Approximately **1.1304**

*Current Metrics (Averages calculated from the current rules):*

- **Average Train Support**: Approximately **0.0570**
- **Average Train Confidence**: Approximately **0.6223**
- **Average Train Lift**: Approximately **1.2478**

---

**Analysis**

1. **Confidence**

   - **Improvement Observed**: The average **train confidence** has increased from **0.5874** to **0.6223**. This indicates that the current rules are making more accurate predictions when the rule conditions are met.
   - **Interpretation**: Higher confidence suggests a greater proportion of instances where the rule's conditions lead to the expected prediction, enhancing the reliability of the rules.

2. **Lift**

   - **Improvement Observed**: The average **train lift** has increased from **1.1304** to **1.2478**. This denotes a stronger association between the rule conditions and the predictions than previously observed.
   - **Interpretation**: A lift value greater than 1 implies that the presence of the rule conditions increases the likelihood of the rule prediction beyond what is expected by chance. The higher lift in the current rules indicates more interesting and potentially valuable associations.

3. **Support**

   - **Decrease Observed**: The average **train support** has decreased significantly from **0.1756** to **0.0570**. This means that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset compared to the previous rules.
   - **Interpretation**: While the rules are more accurate when they apply (as indicated by higher confidence and lift), they cover fewer instances. This trade-off may impact the generalizability and practical utility of the rules.

---

**Evaluation of Rule Performance**

- **Strengths of Current Rules**:
  - **Higher Confidence**: Indicates more accurate predictions within the covered instances.
  - **Higher Lift**: Shows stronger and more significant associations between conditions and predictions.

- **Weaknesses of Current Rules**:
  - **Lower Support**: Suggests that the rules are overly specific and may not capture enough of the dataset to be broadly useful.
  - **Potential Overfitting**: The increase in confidence and lift at the expense of support could indicate that the rules are fitted too closely to the training data, potentially reducing their effectiveness on unseen data.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum Indication**: The metrics suggest that we've reached a point where further iterations may not yield significant improvements. The confidence and lift have improved, but the decrease in support indicates diminishing returns.
- **Enough Iterations**: Given that the refinements are leading to higher accuracy but lower applicability, it may be time to reassess the strategy rather than continue with similar iterations.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Increase Support without Sacrificing Confidence and Lift**:

   - **Broaden Rule Conditions**: Slightly relax some of the overly specific conditions in the rules to include more instances, thereby increasing support.
   - **Example**: For Rule 1, consider including modifiers with amino groups near the carboxyl group, even if they are not strictly on the alpha or beta carbon, if they still contribute to yield.

2. **Combine Similar Rules**:

   - **Merge Overlapping Rules**: Identify rules with similar conditions and outcomes, and combine them to create more general rules that cover more data points.
   - **Example**: Rules 2 and 15 both deal with electron-withdrawing groups enhancing yield. Combining these could increase support.

3. **Reassess Rule Specificity**:

   - **Avoid Over-Specification**: Ensure that rules are not too narrowly defined by avoiding excessive conditions that limit their applicability.
   - **Example**: Rule 4 specifies "multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols)"—consider whether modifiers with only two adjacent hydroxyl groups also result in high yields.

4. **Incorporate Additional Data Analysis**:

   - **Statistical Validation**: Use cross-validation or other statistical methods to verify that the rules hold across different subsets of the data.
   - **Assess Generalizability**: Ensure that the rules are not just fitting the training data but are also predictive for new, unseen data.

5. **Prioritize High-Impact Rules**:

   - **Focus on Rules with High Confidence and Lift but Reasonable Support**: Rules like Rule 4 and Rule 8 have high confidence and lift, and moderate support. Enhancing such rules could improve overall performance.
   - **Optimize Existing High-Performing Rules**: Investigate if these rules can be adjusted to increase their support without significantly reducing confidence.

6. **Iterative Refinement with Balanced Metrics**:

   - **Set Target Ranges**: Define acceptable ranges for support, confidence, and lift to guide the refinement process.
   - **Balanced Approach**: Aim for rules that achieve a balance between being general enough to be widely applicable (higher support) and specific enough to be accurate (higher confidence and lift).

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules have improved in terms of confidence and lift, indicating stronger and more reliable associations when the rules apply. However, the significant decrease in support suggests that the rules are too narrowly focused, covering a smaller portion of the dataset.

To enhance the performance of the current rules, it's essential to:

- **Increase Support**: Broaden the applicability of the rules to cover more instances.
- **Maintain Confidence and Lift**: Ensure that the rules remain accurate and significant.
- **Avoid Overfitting**: Ensure that the rules generalize well to new data by avoiding excessive specificity.

By implementing these recommendations, you can improve the overall effectiveness of the rules, making them both reliable and broadly applicable, which is crucial for the success of the research program.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the current rules appear to be less effective compared to previous iterations. The validation accuracy has decreased significantly, indicating potential issues with the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data.

- **Previous Reference Accuracies:**
  - Validation Accuracies ranged from **0.68 to 0.76**.
  - Test Accuracies ranged from **0.625 to 0.75**.

- **Current Iteration Accuracies:**
  - Validation Accuracies in multiple folds ranged from **0.4857 to 0.7429**, with a significant number of folds showing accuracies around **0.5143**.
  - The final validation accuracy is **0.4857**, which is considerably lower than previous iterations.

This decline in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules is not effectively capturing the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions.

---

**Effectiveness of Current Rules**

The effectiveness of the current rules appears to be inadequate due to:

1. **Decreased Validation Accuracy:**
   - The drop in validation accuracy from previous values (around **0.76**) to the current value (**0.4857**) indicates that the model is not performing well on unseen data.

2. **Consistency Across Folds:**
   - The low accuracies are consistent across multiple folds, suggesting that the issue is systemic rather than due to a particular subset of the data.

---

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Underfitting:**
  - The consistently low validation accuracies across different folds suggest that the model is underfitting. It is not capturing the complexity of the data, possibly due to oversimplified rules or insufficient features.

- **Overfitting Not Evident:**
  - There is no indication of overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on validation data, since both accuracies are low.

---

**Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

The SHAP analysis provides insight into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions. By examining cases where the model's predictions differ from the experimental values, we can identify which rules may be problematic.

1. **Overestimation Cases (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecules:**

     - **C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
     - **C(CCN)CC(=O)O**
     - **CC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**

   - **Observations:**

     - **Rule 6** consistently has a positive SHAP value contributing to the high predicted loading.
     - **Rule 13** also shows a significant positive SHAP value in some cases.

   - **Interpretation:**

     - **Rule 6** may be overemphasizing certain features that lead to high loading predictions, even when the experimental values are low.
     - **Rule 13** might be too broadly defined, causing it to contribute to incorrect high predictions.

2. **Underestimation Cases (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - **Molecules:**

     - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**
     - **C1=CC2=C(C=C1C(=O)O)C(=O)OC2=O**
     - **C(CCN)CC(=O)O**

   - **Observations:**

     - **Rule 2** has negative SHAP values contributing to the low predicted loading.
     - **Rule 5** and **Rule 9** occasionally show negative SHAP values in these cases.

   - **Interpretation:**

     - **Rule 2** might be too restrictive, causing the model to undervalue features that actually contribute to high loading.
     - **Rules 5 and 9** could be misclassifying features that should lead to higher predicted loadings.

---

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

Given that the validation accuracy has decreased compared to previous iterations, it's evident that the current rules are not improving the model's performance. The low accuracy suggests:

- **Lack of Generalization:**
  - The model may not be capturing essential features necessary for accurate predictions.

- **Ineffective Rules:**
  - Some rules may be misguiding the model by either overemphasizing or underemphasizing certain molecular features.

---

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis**

The SHAP values highlight which rules have the most significant impact on the model's predictions for each molecule. Key insights include:

1. **Rule 6:**

   - **High Positive SHAP Values** in overestimations.
   - **Action:** Rule 6 may be too broad and includes molecules that should not contribute to high loading. It needs refinement.

2. **Rule 13:**

   - **High Positive SHAP Values** in overestimations.
   - **Action:** Similar to Rule 6, Rule 13 might be overinclusive and could be adjusted to be more specific.

3. **Rule 2:**

   - **Negative SHAP Values** in underestimations.
   - **Action:** Rule 2 may be too stringent, excluding molecules that should be associated with high loading. It should be broadened slightly.

4. **Rule 9 and Rule 5:**

   - **Negative SHAP Values** contributing to underestimations.
   - **Action:** Reassess these rules to ensure they are not incorrectly penalizing molecules that should have high loading predictions.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis, the following suggestions can help improve the rules and, consequently, the model's performance:

1. **Refine Rule 6:**

   - **Current Rule:** Modifiers that are medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 to 8 carbons) without bulky substituents result in a high yield.
   - **Issues:**
     - The rule may be too inclusive, capturing molecules that do not necessarily result in high loading.
     - Molecules with functional groups that interfere with metal coordination might still be included.
   - **Suggestions:**
     - Add specificity by requiring the absence of functional groups that could hinder metal coordination (e.g., distant amino groups, bulky side chains).
     - Consider limiting the rule to unbranched, saturated chains without polar or interfering substituents.

2. **Adjust Rule 13:**

   - **Current Rule:** Modifiers containing amide linkages or peptide bonds near the carboxyl group result in a low yield.
   - **Issues:**
     - Some molecules with amide linkages might still facilitate high loading due to other coordinating groups.
   - **Suggestions:**
     - Refine the rule to account for additional coordinating groups that could offset the presence of amide linkages.
     - Specify that the negative effect is prominent when amide groups are adjacent to the carboxyl group without other coordinating functionalities.

3. **Broaden Rule 2:**

   - **Current Rule:** Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups at the para position result in a high yield.
   - **Issues:**
     - The rule might exclude molecules with electron-withdrawing groups in other positions that still contribute to high loading.
   - **Suggestions:**
     - Expand the rule to include ortho and meta positions if evidence supports their positive impact.
     - Specify acceptable electron-withdrawing groups and their positions more broadly.

4. **Reevaluate Rule 9:**

   - **Current Rule:** Modifiers with flexible, bulky, or heavily substituted side chains near the carboxyl group result in a low yield.
   - **Issues:**
     - The definition of "near" might be too strict, affecting molecules where the bulky group does not hinder coordination.
   - **Suggestions:**
     - Clarify the spatial considerations of "near" the carboxyl group.
     - Consider the nature of the substituents and their actual impact on steric hindrance.

5. **Update Rule 5:**

   - **Current Rule:** Modifiers containing a thiol group (–SH) adjacent to the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in a high yield; however, thiol groups attached to an aromatic ring result in a low yield.
   - **Issues:**
     - Some aromatic thiols might actually enhance coordination under certain conditions.
   - **Suggestions:**
     - Reassess the exceptions for aromatic thiols.
     - Include additional context, such as the presence of other coordinating groups that could influence the outcome.

6. **Incorporate Additional Features:**

   - **Consider Hydrogen Bonding Potential:**
     - Include rules that account for hydrogen bond donors or acceptors that could influence metal coordination.
   - **Evaluate Electronic Effects:**
     - Assess how electron density distribution in the molecules affects coordination, adjusting rules accordingly.

7. **Improve Generalization:**

   - **Avoid Overfitting:**
     - Ensure that rules are not tailored too closely to specific molecules in the training set.
   - **Balance Specificity and Flexibility:**
     - Rules should be specific enough to be meaningful but flexible enough to capture a range of relevant molecules.

8. **Iterative Testing:**

   - **Validate Adjustments:**
     - After modifying the rules, retrain the model and evaluate performance to ensure improvements.
   - **Monitor SHAP Values:**
     - Use SHAP analysis in subsequent iterations to verify that adjustments lead to better alignment between predictions and experimental values.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules requires refinement to improve the model's predictive accuracy. By focusing on rules that contribute most to incorrect predictions, as indicated by the SHAP analysis, we can adjust the rules to better reflect the underlying chemistry. This involves both tightening overly broad rules and relaxing overly restrictive ones. Iterative refinement, guided by model performance metrics and SHAP analysis, will enhance the model's ability to generalize and accurately predict catalyst loading based on molecular features.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

---

**Summary:**

The discussion focuses on evaluating and improving the current set of rules designed to predict the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction catalyzed by Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe) with various molecular modifiers. Key points from the analysis include:

1. **Rule Metrics Analysis:**

   - **Confidence and Lift:** The current rules show increased average confidence and lift compared to previous iterations, indicating stronger and more reliable associations between the rule conditions and the predicted outcomes.
   
   - **Support:** There is a significant decrease in support, meaning the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. This suggests that the rules may be too specific.

2. **Accuracy and SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Decreased Validation Accuracy:** The validation accuracy has declined compared to previous iterations, indicating that the current rules may not generalize well to unseen data.
   
   - **SHAP Analysis:** Certain rules (notably Rule 6 and Rule 13) may be overemphasizing features, leading to incorrect predictions. Conversely, some rules may be too restrictive, causing underestimation in other cases.

3. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

   - The rules may be causing both overestimation and underestimation of modifier effectiveness due to over-specification or under-specification.
   
   - Evidence of underfitting suggests that the model and rules are not capturing the complexity of the data necessary for accurate predictions.

---

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules:**

Based on the analysis, the following suggestions are proposed to improve the current rules:

1. **Refine Specific Rules:**

   - **Rule 6 (Medium-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids):**

     - **Issue:** The rule may be too broad, including molecules that do not result in high yield (e.g., modifiers with interfering functional groups).
     
     - **Suggestion:** Add specificity by:

       - Requiring the absence of functional groups that hinder metal coordination (e.g., distant amino or hydroxyl groups, bulky side chains).
       
       - Limiting the rule to unbranched, saturated chains without polar or interfering substituents.

     - **Revised Rule:** Modifiers that are medium-chain (6 to 8 carbons), unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups or bulky substituents near the carboxyl group result in a high yield.

   - **Rule 13 (Modifiers with Amide Linkages Near the Carboxyl Group):**

     - **Issue:** The rule might overgeneralize, as some modifiers with amide linkages can still yield high results due to other coordinating groups.
     
     - **Suggestion:** Refine the rule to consider:

       - The presence of additional coordinating groups (e.g., proximal amino or hydroxyl groups) that can offset the negative effect of amide linkages.
       
       - Specifying that the negative effect is significant when amide groups are adjacent to the carboxyl group without other coordinating functionalities.

     - **Revised Rule:** Modifiers containing amide linkages near the carboxyl group without additional proximal coordinating functional groups result in a low yield.

   - **Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing or Coordinating Groups):**

     - **Issue:** The rule may be too restrictive by focusing only on para-substituents.
     
     - **Suggestion:** Broaden the rule to include electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups in the ortho and meta positions if they enhance yield.

     - **Revised Rule:** Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups (such as nitro, amino, halogens) in the para, ortho, or meta positions result in a high yield.

   - **Rule 9 (Modifiers with Bulky or Heavily Substituted Side Chains Near the Carboxyl Group):**

     - **Issue:** The term "near" may be too strictly defined, potentially excluding relevant modifiers.
     
     - **Suggestion:** Clarify spatial considerations by:

       - Defining "near" as within three bonds of the carboxyl group.
       
       - Considering the actual steric hindrance caused by the substituents rather than their mere presence.

     - **Revised Rule:** Modifiers with bulky or heavily substituted side chains within three bonds of the carboxyl group that cause significant steric hindrance result in a low yield.

2. **Adjust SMARTS Patterns for Improved Specificity:**

   - **Optimize Patterns:** Revise SMARTS patterns for each rule to more accurately capture the intended molecular features.

     - **Example for Rule 12:** Modify the pattern to specifically target amino acids with non-coordinating hydrophobic or aromatic side chains:

       ```python
       non_coordinating_amino_acid = '[NX3H2][CX4H]([CX4])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
       ```
       
       This pattern ensures that the amino acid has a side chain without additional coordinating functional groups.

   - **Differentiate Overlapping Rules:** Ensure that similar rules (e.g., Rule 2 and Rule 15) have distinct patterns to prevent confusion and overlap.

3. **Increase Support Without Sacrificing Confidence and Lift:**

   - **Broaden Rule Conditions:** Slightly relax overly specific conditions to include more instances, thus increasing support.

     - For example, in Rule 1, consider including modifiers where the amino group is on the gamma carbon if evidence suggests they enhance yield.

   - **Combine Similar Rules:** Merge overlapping rules to create broader rules that cover more data points.

     - For instance, combine rules concerning electron-withdrawing groups enhancing yield (Rule 2 and Rule 15).

4. **Balance Specificity and Flexibility:**

   - **Avoid Overfitting:** Ensure rules are not excessively narrow, which can lead to overfitting and poor generalization.

   - **Focus on High-Impact Rules:** Prioritize refining rules that have high confidence and lift but moderate support to improve overall performance.

5. **Iterative Refinement and Validation:**

   - **Validate Adjustments:** After revising rules, retrain the model and evaluate performance using cross-validation to ensure improvements are realized.

   - **Monitor SHAP Values:** Use SHAP analysis to verify that the adjusted rules contribute positively to accurate predictions.

6. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features:**

   - **Consider Hydrogen Bonding Potential:** Include rules accounting for hydrogen bond donors or acceptors that may influence metal coordination and catalytic activity.

   - **Evaluate Electronic Effects:** Assess how electron density distribution affects coordination, adjusting rules to reflect the impact of electron-donating or withdrawing groups.

---

**Judgment on Further Optimization Possibility:**

There is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The proposed directions aim to enhance the rules' applicability (support) while maintaining or improving their accuracy (confidence and lift). By refining the rules to balance specificity and generality, we can develop a more effective model that better captures the underlying chemistry and yields more accurate predictions.

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are amino acids with an amino group near the carboxyl group result in a high yield, especially when the amino group is on the alpha or beta carbon.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Amino groups located near the carboxylate allow for chelation, forming bidentate coordination with the metal center. This enhances catalytic activity by stabilizing the metal and facilitating electron transfer.

---

2. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups at the para position result in a high yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal. Coordinating groups like amino or halogens can further stabilize the metal center through additional interactions.

---

3. **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination result in a high yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites for the metal, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing electron transfer processes essential for high catalytic activity.

---

4. **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxyl group result in a high yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Polyol groups can chelate the metal center through multiple hydroxyl interactions, enhancing stability and reactivity of the catalyst.

---

5. **Modifiers containing a thiol group (–SH) adjacent to the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in a high yield; however, thiol groups attached to an aromatic ring result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: In aliphatic compounds, thiol groups near the carboxylate strongly coordinate with metals due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur, enhancing catalytic activity. In aromatic compounds, the thiol group's lone pair can delocalize into the ring, reducing its availability for metal coordination.

---

6. **Modifiers that are medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 to 8 carbons) without bulky substituents result in a high yield.**

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **Octanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: The optimal chain length improves hydrophobic interactions without causing steric hindrance, facilitating effective interaction with the catalyst's active site.

---

7. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups, such as methyl (–CH₃) or methoxy (–OCH₃), result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal center, thus reducing catalytic efficiency.

---

8. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located on distant carbons (more than three carbon atoms away from the carboxyl group) result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with the metal center due to increased flexibility and distance, resulting in lower catalytic activity.

---

9. **Modifiers with flexible, bulky, or heavily substituted side chains near the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

   - **Rationale**: Bulky and flexible substituents can create steric hindrance, preventing the carboxyl group from effectively coordinating with the metal center and thus diminishing catalytic performance.

---

10. **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can either compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or form intramolecular interactions that disrupt optimal binding to the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.

---

11. **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in a low yield.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: The presence of highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduces the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal center and decreasing catalytic activity.

---

12. **Modifiers that are amino acids with non-coordinating hydrophobic or aromatic side chains result in a low yield.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

    - **Rationale**: Side chains lacking additional coordinating functional groups provide minimal interaction with the metal center, leading to weaker catalyst-modifier binding and lower yields.

---

13. **Modifiers containing amide linkages or peptide bonds near the carboxyl group result in a low yield.**

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Amide groups can compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, interfering with effective binding to the metal center and diminishing catalytic efficiency.

---

14. **Modifiers with highly conjugated aromatic systems or multiple electron-donating substituents result in a low yield.**

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Extensive conjugation and electron-donating groups delocalize electron density, reducing the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, and thus decreasing the overall yield.

---

15. **Modifiers combining electron-withdrawing groups with additional coordinating functional groups result in a high yield.**

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

    - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group, while additional coordinating functional groups facilitate stronger metal binding, synergistically improving catalytic activity.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules establish a relationship between specific combinations of functional groups in molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction:

- **High Yield Modifiers** often contain:

  - **Proximal amino groups** near the carboxylate for bidentate coordination (Rule 1).
  - **Aromatic rings** with electron-withdrawing or coordinating para-substituents (Rule 2).
  - **Heterocycles with nitrogen atoms** that serve as additional coordination sites (Rule 3).
  - **Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups** enabling chelation (Rule 4).
  - **Aliphatic thiol groups** adjacent to the carboxylate enhancing metal coordination (Rule 5).
  - **Optimal chain lengths** without bulky substituents for better interaction with the catalyst (Rule 6).
  - **Combinations of electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups** to enhance metal binding (Rule 15).

- **Low Yield Modifiers** typically have:

  - **Electron-donating groups** that reduce carboxylate acidity (Rule 7).
  - **Functional groups distant from the carboxylate**, limiting coordination (Rule 8).
  - **Bulky or flexible substituents** causing steric hindrance (Rule 9).
  - **Adjacent carbonyl groups** competing for metal coordination (Rule 10).
  - **Perfluorination** reducing electron density on the carboxylate (Rule 11).
  - **Non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains** in amino acids (Rule 12).
  - **Amide linkages or peptide bonds** near the carboxylate disrupting coordination (Rule 13).
  - **Highly conjugated systems or multiple electron-donating groups** decreasing carboxylate acidity and coordination (Rule 14).
  - **Aromatic thiol groups** less available for coordination due to delocalization or oxidation (Rule 5, Low Yield example).

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. This aids in the selection or design of modifiers to optimize the catalytic performance of the Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe) system in the target reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
