  *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid)  
  *Rationale*: The presence of both amino and multiple carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield; those with simple aromatic side chains result in low yield.**  
  *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)  
  *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)  
  *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers and participate in electron delocalization, enhancing reactivity, while simple aromatic rings lack this ability.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids containing an amino group directly attached to the ring result in high yield.**  
  *Example*: 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: The amino group at the para position can donate electron density to the ring and interact favorably with the catalyst, enhancing activity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with mercapto (sulfanyl) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, whereas modifiers with mercapto groups on aromatic rings result in low yield.**  
  *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Aliphatic mercapto groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability, while aromatic mercapto groups may lead to catalyst poisoning.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings attached to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar modifiers with shorter chains result in low yield.**  
  *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid  
  *Low Yield Examples*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and distance that favor interactions with the catalyst, whereas shorter chains may cause steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids in aliphatic chains result in low yield.**  
  *Example*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid  
  *Rationale*: Ketone groups near carboxylic acids can chelate metal ions, possibly deactivating the catalyst or favoring side reactions.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on aromatic rings at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid tend to result in high yield, unless other inhibitory functional groups are present.**  
  *Example*: 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups increase the electron density of the aromatic ring, enhancing interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aromatic heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield.**  
  *Examples*: 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in its structural description of α-amino dicarboxylic acids containing both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups, allowing for unambiguous determination of high-yield modifiers. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how these functional groups enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance. It considers the combination of functional groups rather than a single group, adding necessary complexity. The rule is supported by at least two data points (glutamic acid and aspartic acid) showing high yield, providing sufficient coverage. Overall, it strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly distinguishes between amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains (resulting in high yield) and those with simple aromatic side chains (resulting in low yield), enabling clear predictions. The rule offers physical-chemical insight by explaining the role of heteroaromatic rings in coordination and electron delocalization. It adds complexity by considering the nature of the side chain in amino acids. The rule is supported by data points for tryptophan (high yield) and phenylalanine (low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion. There's a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in specifying that modifiers with an amino group directly attached at the para position of an aromatic carboxylic acid result in high yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound, explaining the electron-donating effect of the amino group enhancing catalyst interaction. However, the rule is only supported by one data point (4-aminobenzoic acid), which weakens its coverage. While the rule adds necessary complexity by considering specific positions of substituents, the limited data support makes it less robust. A broader analysis or additional data points would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly states that modifiers with mercapto groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, while those on aromatic rings result in low yield, allowing for precise predictions. The rationale provides insight into how aliphatic mercapto groups form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability, while aromatic mercapto groups may poison the catalyst. The rule combines functional group type and its attachment (aliphatic vs. aromatic), adding necessary complexity. It is supported by data points for 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield), meeting the coverage criterion. The rule strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly defines that modifiers with aromatic rings attached to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in high yield, whereas those with shorter chains result in low yield. The rule provides physical-chemical insight by suggesting that longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and favorable interactions with the catalyst. It adds complexity by considering both chain length and functional groups. The rule is well-supported by multiple data points, including high-yield examples (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) and low-yield examples (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), fulfilling the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 states that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to their electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobic nature, which is clear and understandable. The physical-chemical insight is sound, explaining how these properties can hinder the reaction. However, the rule is only supported by a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), limiting its coverage. The rule is specific to perfluorinated alkyl chains, which adds complexity but also narrows its applicability. Increasing the number of data points or generalizing the rule could enhance its robustness and balance.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly indicates that modifiers with aldehyde groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield, as they can coordinate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, deactivating the catalyst. The physical-chemical insight is adequate. The rule adds complexity by focusing on specific functional groups on aromatic rings. It is supported by two data points showing low yield (4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule is balanced in complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly defines that modifiers with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic carboxylic acids (seven or more carbons) result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight suggests that these terminal groups may interfere with catalyst binding or lead to unfavorable conformations. The rule adds necessary complexity by considering both chain length and terminal functional groups. It is supported by multiple data points showing low yield (7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), which meets the coverage criterion. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 specifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains, especially adjacent ones, result in high yield due to enhanced solubility and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst. The rule is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight. It introduces complexity by focusing on multiple functional groups and their arrangement. The rule is supported by data points for gluconic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid, meeting the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that modifiers which are pyridine carboxylic acids, especially with the carboxylic acid at the 3-position, result in high yield due to the nitrogen coordinating with metal centers. The rule is clear but somewhat narrowly focused. It provides physical-chemical insight about coordination. While nicotinic acid (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) supports the rule, there is limited data for other similar compounds, which reduces coverage. The rule adds complexity by specifying both the heterocycle and substitution position but could benefit from broader data or generalization to improve coverage and balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly states that modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids in aliphatic chains result in low yield, possibly due to chelating metal ions and deactivating the catalyst. The physical-chemical insight is adequate. The rule introduces complexity through the specific arrangement of functional groups. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (4-oxoheptanedioic acid), limiting its coverage. Expanding data support or generalizing the rule could improve its balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 suggests that modifiers with electron-donating groups at the para position on aromatic rings tend to result in high yield unless other inhibitory groups are present. While the rule is clear, the presence of exceptions and conflicting data (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid with low yield despite fitting the rule) makes it less reliable. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, but the rule's complexity increases due to exceptions. Coverage is limited and inconsistent, reducing its effectiveness. The balance between complexity and coverage is poor, indicating the rule may need refinement or reevaluation in light of the data.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly states that modifiers with aromatic heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield due to their ability to coordinate with metal centers. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate. The rule adds complexity by focusing on specific structural features. It is supported by data points (1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid) showing high yield, satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 specifies that modifiers with directly attached aromatic rings substituted with bulky groups at the para position result in low yield due to steric hindrance preventing effective interaction with the catalyst. The rule is clear and provides physical-chemical insight. However, it is supported by only one data point (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid with low yield), limiting its coverage. While the rule adds complexity by considering steric factors, more data is needed to strengthen its validity and balance.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 suggests that simple straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with an even number of carbons result in high yield unless terminal functional groups decrease yield. While the rule attempts to provide a pattern, it lacks clarity in defining "simple" and how terminal functional groups affect yield. The physical-chemical insight is minimal, and the rule may oversimplify the relationship. Coverage is limited to octanoic acid showing high yield, with insufficient data to confirm the pattern. The balance between complexity and coverage is poor, indicating that the rule may not be robust enough without further data and clarification.

However, it is supported by only one data point—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid—which does not satisfy the coverage criterion. Additional supporting data would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly identifies modifiers with aldehyde groups directly attached to aromatic rings as resulting in low yield. The physical-chemical insight is sufficient, explaining potential catalyst deactivation. It is supported by at least two data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—meeting the coverage requirement. The rule is well-balanced.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 effectively distinguishes modifiers based on the length of aliphatic chains connecting aromatic rings to carboxylic acids. It is clear and provides good physical-chemical insight. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by data points like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (high yield) and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

It is supported by at least two data points—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid—fulfilling the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly specifies that adjacent ketone or amide groups to the carboxylic acid function lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, addressing chelation and interference with catalytic sites. Supported by 4-oxoheptanedioic acid and (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, it meets the coverage requirement and is well-balanced.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 identifies trifluoroacetyl groups as leading to low yield due to electron-withdrawing effects. While the rule is clear and provides physical-chemical insight, it is supported by only one data point—4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid. This does not meet the coverage criterion, and additional examples would strengthen the rule.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (amino acids with two carboxyl groups) or amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows strong chelation with metal centers. Heteroaromatic side chains (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) can coordinate with metals, enhancing catalyst performance. Simple aromatic side chains or additional amide groups may not provide effective coordination or may interfere with catalyst binding.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with substituents capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) result in high yield; those with non-coordinating or interfering substituents (e.g., methyl, formyl, mercapto) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted medium-length aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, improving binding. Terminal polar groups can disrupt these interactions or introduce unfavorable electronic effects.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst through hydrogen bonding.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and enable extensive hydrogen bonding with the catalyst, improving catalyst-modifier interactions and catalytic performance.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with mercapto (thiol) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with mercapto groups on aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can form flexible, beneficial interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or cause catalyst deactivation.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-rich conjugated systems adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in high yield due to effective coordination with metal centers.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich systems can delocalize electrons and coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through favorable electronic interactions.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated groups reduce electron density and solubility, disrupting interactions with the catalyst and decreasing yield.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyglycol ether chains result in low yield due to non-specific interactions that interfere with catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt conformations that hinder effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring or carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through strong chelation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and optimal spacing for effective interactions with the catalyst, while shorter chains may cause steric hindrance or limit necessary conformational adjustments.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance that impedes catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups obstruct access to the catalyst's active sites, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier binding and thus decreasing yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with trifluoroacetyl or other strongly electron-withdrawing groups result in low yield due to decreased electron density that hinders coordination with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease the availability of electrons for coordination with the catalyst, hindering performance and reducing yield.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential chelation that deactivates the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong chelating interactions with metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains terminated with amino or hydroxyl groups on medium-length chains (6 to 8 carbons) result in low yield due to disruption of hydrophobic interactions needed for effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Terminal polar groups on medium-length chains disrupt hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, decreasing binding affinity and catalytic efficiency.

  - *Rationale*: Dicarboxylic α-amino acids can chelate metal ions through both carboxylate groups and the amino group, enhancing coordination with the catalyst's metal center. This effective chelation improves catalyst interaction and increases yield. Amino acids lacking an additional carboxylate group or with modified amino groups do not provide the same level of coordination, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with metal-coordinating substituents (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with non-coordinating or electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers (such as amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups) enhance the modifier's ability to bind to the catalyst, facilitating electron transfer and improving catalytic activity. Non-coordinating groups or electron-donating substituents do not provide these interactions, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing interactions with the catalyst and increasing yield. If the nitrogen is sterically hindered or not optimally positioned for coordination, as in 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, the effectiveness is reduced, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) lacking polar terminal groups result in high yield; those with terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, improving binding and catalytic performance. Terminal polar groups can disrupt these interactions by introducing polarity and interfering with the optimal alignment of the modifier on the catalyst surface, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups increases the potential for hydrogen bonding with the catalyst, enhancing the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity, leading to higher yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol (mercapto) groups result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. In contrast, aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to non-specific interactions that disrupt effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that hinder proper orientation and binding of the modifier to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may introduce additional non-specific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions and leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease the electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst and reducing yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential competition with the catalyst binding sites.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong interactions through hydrogen bonding or coordination with metal centers, potentially blocking or competing with the catalyst's active sites. This competition reduces the effectiveness of catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide the necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains may restrict these interactions due to steric hindrance or insufficient length for optimal alignment, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic rings directly connected to each other result in low yield due to steric hindrance that impedes catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The direct connection of bulky aromatic rings can hinder access to the catalyst's active sites, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier binding. This steric hindrance limits the interactions necessary for catalytic activity, leading to lower yield.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward classification of modifiers into high or low yield based on their structures as α-amino dicarboxylic acids or α-amino monocarboxylic acids. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how two carboxylate groups enhance metal chelation and coordination with the catalyst. It considers combinations of functional groups (amino and carboxylate groups at the α position), adding appropriate complexity. The rule is supported by at least three data points (high yield: aspartic acid, glutamic acid; low yield: phenylalanine), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and enables classification of modifiers based on the nature of the para-substituent on benzoic acids, distinguishing between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups. It provides sufficient physical-chemical insight by relating substituents' electronic effects to metal coordination and catalyst binding. The rule incorporates complexity by considering both the aromatic system and the electronic nature of substituents. It is well-supported by multiple data points (high yield: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid; low yield: 4-methylbenzoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly identifies modifiers that will result in high yield by their structures as heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings enhance interaction with the catalyst. It incorporates complexity by considering both the heteroaromatic ring and the coordinating nitrogen atoms. The rule is supported by three high yield data points (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is reasonably clear in distinguishing modifiers based on chain length and the presence of terminal polar groups. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight by relating hydrophobic interactions to catalytic performance and explaining how terminal polar groups can disrupt these interactions. The rule adds complexity by considering chain length and functional group positioning. However, the coverage for high yield examples is limited to one data point (octanoic acid), which may reduce the robustness of the rule. The low yield examples are better represented with three data points (7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), satisfying that aspect of coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and specifies that modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining the role of hydrogen bonding in stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex. It adds complexity by considering the presence and positioning of multiple hydroxyl groups. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (gluconic acid), which does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two supporting data points, reducing confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in distinguishing between modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups (resulting in high yield) and aromatic thiol groups (resulting in low yield). The rule offers adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how aromatic thiols may lead to catalyst poisoning due to strong binding, whereas aliphatic thiols interact beneficially without deactivating the catalyst. It introduces complexity by considering both the nature of the thiol group and the molecular framework. The rule is based on two data points (high yield: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid; low yield: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), meeting the minimal coverage criterion, though more data points would strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and allows for the identification of modifiers that result in low yield based on the presence of carbonyl groups directly attached to aromatic rings. It provides physical-chemical insight by explaining potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions caused by these groups. The rule introduces appropriate complexity by considering both functional groups and their positioning relative to the aromatic ring. It is supported by two low yield data points (4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear in identifying modifiers that result in low yield due to the presence of flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups. The rule offers physical-chemical insight by explaining how such structures hinder effective catalyst binding through non-specific interactions and conformational flexibility. It incorporates complexity by considering both the chain flexibility and functional group effects. The rule is supported by two low yield data points (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in stating that modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining the impact of electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms and increased hydrophobicity on catalyst interaction. It incorporates appropriate complexity by considering the substituent effects of fluorination. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), which does not satisfy the coverage criterion, reducing the confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear in identifying modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function as resulting in low yield. The rule provides physical-chemical insight by explaining how these amide groups can compete with catalyst binding sites. It adds complexity by considering the specific positioning of functional groups. The rule is supported by two low yield data points ((2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly distinguishes modifiers based on the length of the aliphatic chain connecting an aromatic ring to the carboxylic acid. It provides physical-chemical insight by explaining how chain length affects flexibility and interaction with the catalyst. The rule incorporates complexity by considering both the aromatic system and chain length. It is supported by two high yield examples (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) and one low yield example (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly identifies modifiers with bulky aromatic rings directly connected to each other as resulting in low yield due to steric hindrance. The rule offers physical-chemical insight by explaining how steric factors impede catalyst interaction. It introduces complexity by considering the structural arrangement of aromatic rings. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), which does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two supporting data points, reducing confidence in the rule.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield; α-amino monocarboxylic acids with aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) result in low yield, while those with extended conjugated aromatic systems (e.g., tryptophan) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of two carboxylate groups enhances metal chelation and coordination with the catalyst, improving interaction and increasing yield. In the case of tryptophan, the extended indole ring offers additional π-π interactions with the catalyst. Monocarboxylic acids with simple aromatic side chains lack these enhanced interactions, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing or metal-coordinating groups (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, thiol) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups enhance the ability of the modifier to interact with metal centers by increasing the acidity of the carboxylic acid and facilitating better coordination. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and coordination potential, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination result in high yield; however, if bulky aromatic rings are directly connected, resulting in steric hindrance, the yield is low.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield. However, direct connection of bulky aromatic rings, as in 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, can cause steric hindrance that impedes effective catalyst interaction, resulting in low yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) lacking terminal polar groups result in high yield; introducing terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains promote hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Terminal polar groups introduce polarity and hydrogen bonding, disrupting these interactions and leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the potential for hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol (–SH) groups result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that disrupt effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that hinder proper orientation and binding of the modifier to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups introduce additional nonspecific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential competition with the catalyst binding sites and altered electronic properties.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong interactions through hydrogen bonding or coordination with metal centers, potentially blocking or competing with the catalyst's active sites and altering the acidity of the carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains restrict these interactions due to steric hindrance or insufficient length for optimal alignment.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing rigid, fused aromatic systems that allow for π-π stacking interactions with the catalyst result in high yield due to enhanced binding affinity.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Fused aromatic systems can engage in strong π-π stacking interactions with the catalyst's aromatic components, improving binding and catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxylic acid on aromatic rings (salicylic acid derivatives) result in low yield due to strong chelation that may lead to catalyst deactivation.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The ortho-hydroxyl group can strongly chelate metal centers, potentially leading to catalyst deactivation or blocking active sites, thus reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings without flexible linkers result in low yield due to steric hindrance that impedes catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups directly attached to aromatic rings can prevent effective binding to the catalyst by blocking approach to the active sites, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl groups result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects that decrease the coordinating ability of functional groups.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The trifluoroacetyl group is highly electron-withdrawing, which can reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms (e.g., amino or carboxyl groups), diminishing their ability to interact with the catalyst's metal centers.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of two carboxylate groups enhances metal chelation and coordination with the catalyst, improving interaction and increasing yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with extended conjugated side chains (e.g., tryptophan) result in high yield; those with non-conjugated aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: Extended conjugated systems like the indole ring in tryptophan can engage in π-π stacking with the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic activity. Non-conjugated aromatic side chains lack this interaction, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, amino, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, thiol) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance metal coordination with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination potential, leading to reduced catalytic interaction and lower yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in high yield due to enhanced metal coordination.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for metal ions, improving interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no terminal polar groups result in high yield; introducing terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains promote hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Terminal polar groups introduce polarity and can disrupt these interactions, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase opportunities for hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with aromatic aldehyde or ketone groups (e.g., formyl groups) directly attached to the ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with fused aromatic systems adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in high yield due to potential π-π stacking interactions with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Fused aromatic rings can engage in strong π-π stacking interactions with the catalyst's aromatic components, enhancing binding and catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains may not allow optimal alignment, reducing yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential competition with the catalyst binding sites and altered electronic properties.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong interactions through hydrogen bonding or coordination with metal centers, potentially blocking or competing with the catalyst's active sites and altering the acidity of the carboxylic acid.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylate groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions, enhancing coordination with the catalyst and improving yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, amido) onto the chain leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains facilitate hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Polar groups introduce polarity that can disrupt these interactions, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are small aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups interact favorably with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring and not directly connected to other aromatic rings result in high yield; direct linkage to another aromatic ring results in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for metal ions, improving interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield. Direct linkage to another aromatic ring can cause steric hindrance or alter electronic properties, reducing coordination effectiveness and yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; some electron-donating groups (e.g., amino) can also result in high yield if they enhance metal coordination.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance metal coordination with the catalyst. Certain electron-donating groups like amino can also coordinate directly with metal centers, improving yield. Groups that lead to catalyst deactivation or side reactions (e.g., formyl) result in low yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase opportunities for hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains result in high yield if the side chain contains additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan); those lacking such groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of additional coordination sites in the side chain enhances metal interaction with the catalyst, increasing yield. Side chains without coordinating groups are less effective in promoting catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aromatic aldehyde or ketone groups directly attached to the ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are long-chain ω-amino acids (more than six carbons) result in low yield; shorter-chain ω-amino acids (five carbons or fewer) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Shorter-chain ω-amino acids may interact more effectively with the catalyst due to optimal chain length and reduced flexibility, enhancing yield. Longer chains may introduce too much flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective binding.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are 4-substituted phenylalkanoic acids where the alkanoic chain has four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains may not allow optimal alignment, reducing yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl or other strongly electron-withdrawing acyl groups result in low yield due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of potential donor atoms (e.g., amino groups) to coordinate with the metal catalyst, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) result in high yield; those lacking such groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Side chains without coordinating groups are less effective, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enable strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or keto groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic systems can form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; longer-chain ω-amino acids result in low yield due to decreased effective coordination with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Shorter ω-amino acids maintain optimal chain length for effective interaction with the catalyst. Longer chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether chains with terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains may adopt conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups can engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the effectiveness of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density on potential donor atoms, reducing coordination ability. Increased hydrophobicity may disrupt interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids with short chains result in high yield; aromatic thiol-containing acids result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols can interact favorably with the catalyst without strongly deactivating it. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly to metal centers, causing irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are substituted phenylalkanoic acids with appropriate chain lengths and functional groups capable of coordinating with the catalyst result in high yield; inadequate chain length or lack of coordinating groups leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: An optimal aliphatic chain length allows the functional groups to interact effectively with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide sufficient flexibility or spacing for effective coordination, reducing yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing acylated amino groups with strong electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., trifluoroacetyl) result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, hindering its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst and decreasing yield.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with conjugated systems that include electron-withdrawing groups capable of chelation result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Conjugated systems with electron-withdrawing groups can coordinate with the metal center, stabilizing the complex and enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing sulfur in functional groups show variable yields depending on their structure; simple aliphatic sulfhydryl groups may lead to high yield, whereas more complex sulfur functionalities or those in aromatic systems may lead to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: The nature and position of the sulfur-containing group impact its ability to interact with the catalyst. Simple aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively, while aromatic thiols or complex sulfur functionalities may bind too strongly or inefficiently, reducing catalytic activity.

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce electron density on potential donor atoms, hindering coordination with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning; aliphatic thiol-containing modifiers may result in high yield.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic thiols may bind strongly to metal centers, leading to irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity. Aliphatic thiols may not have the same deactivating effect.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are substituted phenylalkanoic acids with a chain length of five carbons and additional coordinating groups result in high yield; shorter chain lengths or lack of coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Sufficient aliphatic chain length allows the coordinating groups to effectively interact with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide adequate spacing for coordination.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups bearing strong electron-withdrawing substituents result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, impairing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains result in high yield due to enhanced chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an amino group and an additional carboxylic acid group increases coordination sites, strengthening the catalyst-modifier interaction.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic systems capable of chelation result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic structures provide additional coordination sites through heteroatoms, enhancing the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains and additional functional groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Bulky substituents or long chains with additional functional groups can hinder effective coordination with the catalyst by introducing steric constraints.
