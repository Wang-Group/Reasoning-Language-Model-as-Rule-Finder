**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The hydrophobic chain facilitates favorable interactions with the catalyst's hydrophobic regions without interference from additional functional groups.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position typically result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents may result in variable yields.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - *Variable Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid** (high yield), **4-methylbenzoic acid** (low yield)
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Electron-donating groups can have mixed effects depending on their ability to coordinate with the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing accessible coordinating nitrogen atoms result in high yield; sterically hindered nitrogen atoms may reduce yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing modifier-catalyst interactions. Steric hindrance can impede this coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains result in low yield due to decreased effective interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether linkages can adopt conformations that prevent proper alignment with the catalyst's active sites, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of chelation (e.g., containing heteroatoms) result in high yield; those with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)
  - *Rationale*: Side chains with heteroatoms enhance coordination with the catalyst. Non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains do not contribute to effective binding.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enable strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the complex.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic ω-amino acids with a chain length of five carbons result in high yield; longer chain lengths result in low yield due to decreased effective coordination.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: A five-carbon chain optimizes the spatial arrangement for coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce electron density on potential donor atoms, hindering coordination with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning; aliphatic thiol-containing modifiers may result in high yield.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic thiols may bind strongly to metal centers, leading to irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity. Aliphatic thiols may not have the same deactivating effect.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are substituted phenylalkanoic acids with a chain length of five carbons and additional coordinating groups result in high yield; shorter chain lengths or lack of coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Sufficient aliphatic chain length allows the coordinating groups to effectively interact with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide adequate spacing for coordination.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups bearing strong electron-withdrawing substituents result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, impairing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains result in high yield due to enhanced chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an amino group and an additional carboxylic acid group increases coordination sites, strengthening the catalyst-modifier interaction.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic systems capable of chelation result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic structures provide additional coordination sites through heteroatoms, enhancing the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains and additional functional groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Bulky substituents or long chains with additional functional groups can hinder effective coordination with the catalyst by introducing steric constraints.
