**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids containing both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups result in high yield.**  
  *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid)  
  *Rationale*: The presence of both amino and multiple carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield; those with simple aromatic side chains result in low yield.**  
  *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)  
  *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)  
  *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers and participate in electron delocalization, enhancing reactivity, while simple aromatic rings lack this ability.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids containing an amino group directly attached to the ring result in high yield.**  
  *Example*: 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: The amino group at the para position can donate electron density to the ring and interact favorably with the catalyst, enhancing activity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with mercapto (sulfanyl) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, whereas modifiers with mercapto groups on aromatic rings result in low yield.**  
  *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Aliphatic mercapto groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability, while aromatic mercapto groups may lead to catalyst poisoning.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings attached to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar modifiers with shorter chains result in low yield.**  
  *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid  
  *Low Yield Examples*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and distance that favor interactions with the catalyst, whereas shorter chains may cause steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity.**  
  *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Perfluorinated groups can decrease solubility and disrupt interactions with the catalyst, hindering the reaction.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.**  
  *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can coordinate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic carboxylic acids (chains of seven or more carbons) result in low yield.**  
  *Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Terminal functional groups on long chains may interfere with catalyst binding or lead to unfavorable conformations.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains, especially those with adjacent hydroxyl groups, result in high yield.**  
  *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)  
  *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and can form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst, improving its performance.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids, especially with the carboxylic acid at the 3-position, result in high yield.**  
  *Example*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid)  
  *Rationale*: The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, and the 3-position carboxylic acid optimizes this interaction.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids in aliphatic chains result in low yield.**  
  *Example*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid  
  *Rationale*: Ketone groups near carboxylic acids can chelate metal ions, possibly deactivating the catalyst or favoring side reactions.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on aromatic rings at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid tend to result in high yield, unless other inhibitory functional groups are present.**  
  *Example*: 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups increase the electron density of the aromatic ring, enhancing interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aromatic heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield.**  
  *Examples*: 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid  
  *Rationale*: Heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, facilitating catalyst activity.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with directly attached aromatic rings substituted with bulky groups at the para position result in low yield.**  
  *Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Bulky substituents can cause steric hindrance, preventing effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: **Simple straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with an even number of carbons result in high yield, unless terminal functional groups decrease yield.**  
  *Example*: Octanoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Even-chain fatty acids have optimal packing and interaction with the catalyst surface.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in its structural description of α-amino dicarboxylic acids containing both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups, allowing for unambiguous determination of high-yield modifiers. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how these functional groups enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance. It considers the combination of functional groups rather than a single group, adding necessary complexity. The rule is supported by at least two data points (glutamic acid and aspartic acid) showing high yield, providing sufficient coverage. Overall, it strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly distinguishes between amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains (resulting in high yield) and those with simple aromatic side chains (resulting in low yield), enabling clear predictions. The rule offers physical-chemical insight by explaining the role of heteroaromatic rings in coordination and electron delocalization. It adds complexity by considering the nature of the side chain in amino acids. The rule is supported by data points for tryptophan (high yield) and phenylalanine (low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion. There's a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in specifying that modifiers with an amino group directly attached at the para position of an aromatic carboxylic acid result in high yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound, explaining the electron-donating effect of the amino group enhancing catalyst interaction. However, the rule is only supported by one data point (4-aminobenzoic acid), which weakens its coverage. While the rule adds necessary complexity by considering specific positions of substituents, the limited data support makes it less robust. A broader analysis or additional data points would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly states that modifiers with mercapto groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, while those on aromatic rings result in low yield, allowing for precise predictions. The rationale provides insight into how aliphatic mercapto groups form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability, while aromatic mercapto groups may poison the catalyst. The rule combines functional group type and its attachment (aliphatic vs. aromatic), adding necessary complexity. It is supported by data points for 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield), meeting the coverage criterion. The rule strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly defines that modifiers with aromatic rings attached to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in high yield, whereas those with shorter chains result in low yield. The rule provides physical-chemical insight by suggesting that longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and favorable interactions with the catalyst. It adds complexity by considering both chain length and functional groups. The rule is well-supported by multiple data points, including high-yield examples (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) and low-yield examples (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), fulfilling the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 states that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to their electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobic nature, which is clear and understandable. The physical-chemical insight is sound, explaining how these properties can hinder the reaction. However, the rule is only supported by a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), limiting its coverage. The rule is specific to perfluorinated alkyl chains, which adds complexity but also narrows its applicability. Increasing the number of data points or generalizing the rule could enhance its robustness and balance.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly indicates that modifiers with aldehyde groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield, as they can coordinate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, deactivating the catalyst. The physical-chemical insight is adequate. The rule adds complexity by focusing on specific functional groups on aromatic rings. It is supported by two data points showing low yield (4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule is balanced in complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly defines that modifiers with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic carboxylic acids (seven or more carbons) result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight suggests that these terminal groups may interfere with catalyst binding or lead to unfavorable conformations. The rule adds necessary complexity by considering both chain length and terminal functional groups. It is supported by multiple data points showing low yield (7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), which meets the coverage criterion. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 specifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains, especially adjacent ones, result in high yield due to enhanced solubility and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst. The rule is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight. It introduces complexity by focusing on multiple functional groups and their arrangement. The rule is supported by data points for gluconic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid, meeting the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that modifiers which are pyridine carboxylic acids, especially with the carboxylic acid at the 3-position, result in high yield due to the nitrogen coordinating with metal centers. The rule is clear but somewhat narrowly focused. It provides physical-chemical insight about coordination. While nicotinic acid (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) supports the rule, there is limited data for other similar compounds, which reduces coverage. The rule adds complexity by specifying both the heterocycle and substitution position but could benefit from broader data or generalization to improve coverage and balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly states that modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids in aliphatic chains result in low yield, possibly due to chelating metal ions and deactivating the catalyst. The physical-chemical insight is adequate. The rule introduces complexity through the specific arrangement of functional groups. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (4-oxoheptanedioic acid), limiting its coverage. Expanding data support or generalizing the rule could improve its balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 suggests that modifiers with electron-donating groups at the para position on aromatic rings tend to result in high yield unless other inhibitory groups are present. While the rule is clear, the presence of exceptions and conflicting data (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid with low yield despite fitting the rule) makes it less reliable. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, but the rule's complexity increases due to exceptions. Coverage is limited and inconsistent, reducing its effectiveness. The balance between complexity and coverage is poor, indicating the rule may need refinement or reevaluation in light of the data.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly states that modifiers with aromatic heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield due to their ability to coordinate with metal centers. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate. The rule adds complexity by focusing on specific structural features. It is supported by data points (1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid) showing high yield, satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 specifies that modifiers with directly attached aromatic rings substituted with bulky groups at the para position result in low yield due to steric hindrance preventing effective interaction with the catalyst. The rule is clear and provides physical-chemical insight. However, it is supported by only one data point (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid with low yield), limiting its coverage. While the rule adds complexity by considering steric factors, more data is needed to strengthen its validity and balance.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 suggests that simple straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with an even number of carbons result in high yield unless terminal functional groups decrease yield. While the rule attempts to provide a pattern, it lacks clarity in defining "simple" and how terminal functional groups affect yield. The physical-chemical insight is minimal, and the rule may oversimplify the relationship. Coverage is limited to octanoic acid showing high yield, with insufficient data to confirm the pattern. The balance between complexity and coverage is poor, indicating that the rule may not be robust enough without further data and clarification.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids containing both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups result in high yield.**  
  *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid)  
  *Rationale*: The presence of both amino and multiple carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield; those with simple aromatic side chains result in low yield.**  
  *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)  
  *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)  
  *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers and participate in electron delocalization, enhancing reactivity, while simple aromatic rings lack this ability.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids containing an amino group directly attached to the ring result in high yield.**  
  *Example*: 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: The amino group at the para position can donate electron density to the ring and interact favorably with the catalyst, enhancing activity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with mercapto (sulfanyl) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, whereas modifiers with mercapto groups on aromatic rings result in low yield.**  
  *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Aliphatic mercapto groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability, while aromatic mercapto groups may lead to catalyst poisoning.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings attached to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar modifiers with shorter chains result in low yield.**  
  *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid  
  *Low Yield Examples*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and distance that favor interactions with the catalyst, whereas shorter chains may cause steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity.**  
  *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Perfluorinated groups can decrease solubility and disrupt interactions with the catalyst, hindering the reaction.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.**  
  *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can coordinate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic carboxylic acids (chains of seven or more carbons) result in low yield.**  
  *Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Terminal functional groups on long chains may interfere with catalyst binding or lead to unfavorable conformations.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains, especially those with adjacent hydroxyl groups, result in high yield.**  
  *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)  
  *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and can form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst, improving its performance.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids, especially with the carboxylic acid at the 3-position, result in high yield.**  
  *Example*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid)  
  *Rationale*: The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, and the 3-position carboxylic acid optimizes this interaction.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids in aliphatic chains result in low yield.**  
  *Example*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid  
  *Rationale*: Ketone groups near carboxylic acids can chelate metal ions, possibly deactivating the catalyst or favoring side reactions.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on aromatic rings at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid tend to result in high yield, unless other inhibitory functional groups are present.**  
  *Example*: 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups increase the electron density of the aromatic ring, enhancing interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aromatic heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield.**  
  *Examples*: 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid  
  *Rationale*: Heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, facilitating catalyst activity.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with directly attached aromatic rings substituted with bulky groups at the para position result in low yield.**  
  *Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Bulky substituents can cause steric hindrance, preventing effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: **Simple straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with an even number of carbons result in high yield, unless terminal functional groups decrease yield.**  
  *Example*: Octanoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Even-chain fatty acids have optimal packing and interaction with the catalyst surface.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**
- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 2** - The SMARTS patterns for 'heteroaromatic_ring' (`[a;!c]`) and 'aromatic_ring' (`c1ccccc1`) are too general and may match any heteroaromatic or aromatic ring anywhere in the molecule, not specifically in the side chain of the amino acid. Modify the SMARTS patterns to specifically match heteroaromatic and aromatic side chains attached to the alpha carbon of an amino acid. For example, define the side chain attachment to the alpha carbon: `'[NX3H2][CHX4][CH2][a]'` for heteroaromatic side chains and `'[NX3H2][CHX4][CH2]c1ccccc1'` for aromatic side chains.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Rule 3** - The SMARTS pattern `'c1ccc(N)cc1C(=O)O'` is too specific and only matches 4-aminobenzoic acid. Generalize the pattern to match any para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acid with an amino group directly attached to the ring. Use a pattern like `'c1ccc(cc1)[NX3H2]C(=O)O'` or `'c1cc(N)ccc1C(=O)O'` to capture other similar compounds.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Rule 4** - The SMARTS pattern for mercapto groups on aliphatic chains (`'[CX4][CX4][SX2H]'`) is too restrictive, only matching chains with exactly two carbons before the thiol group. Generalize the pattern to `'[CX4,H][CX4,H]*[SX2H]'` to match mercapto groups on any length of aliphatic chain.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Rule 5** - The SMARTS patterns for positive (`'[CX3](=O)[OX2H][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]c1ccccc1'`) and negative matches (`'[CX3](=O)[OX2H][CX4][CX4][CX4]c1ccccc1'`) are too specific, matching only chains with exactly four or three carbons, respectively. Modify the patterns to use repetitions and ranges. For positive matches, use `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H][CX4]{4,}c1ccccc1'` to match chains with four or more carbons. For negative matches, use `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H][CX4]{1,3}c1ccccc1'` to match chains shorter than four carbons.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Rule 6** - The SMARTS pattern for perfluorinated alkyl chains (`'[CX4]([F])([F])([F])'`) only matches trifluoromethyl groups. Expand the pattern to match longer perfluoroalkyl chains by using repetitions. For example, use `'[CX4]([F])([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[F]'` to match perfluoroethyl groups or `'[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])([F])'` with variable repetitions to capture longer chains.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Rule 8** - The SMARTS patterns for terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains only match chains with exactly six carbons before the carboxylic acid. Generalize these patterns to match chains with seven or more carbons by using repetitions. Use patterns like `'[NX3H2,NX3H1][CH2]{6,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` and `'[OX2H][CH2]{6,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Rule 9** - The SMARTS pattern `'[OX2H][CH2][CHX4][OX2H]'` only matches a specific arrangement of adjacent hydroxyl groups. Generalize the pattern to detect multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains by using recursive SMARTS or counting. For example, use a pattern like `'[CX4;!$(C(=O))](O)[CX4;!$(C(=O))](O)'` to match adjacent hydroxyls or `'[CX4;!$(C(=O))](O)[CX4;!$(C(=O))][CX4;!$(C(=O))](O)'` for hydroxyls separated by one carbon.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Rule 10** - The SMARTS pattern `'n1ccccc1C(=O)O'` only matches pyridine-3-carboxylic acid. Generalize it to match pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxylic acid at any position, especially the 3-position. Use a pattern like `'n1ccccc1C(=O)O'` for 3-position and add patterns for other positions, or use `'n[cH1,c]ccc[cH1,c]C(=O)O'` to match carboxylic acids attached to pyridine rings.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Rule 12** - The electron-donating group patterns (`'c[OX2H]'` and `'c[NX3H2]'`) match hydroxyl and amino groups anywhere on the aromatic ring, not specifically at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. Modify the patterns to enforce the para relationship. For example, use a SMARTS pattern that defines the carboxylic acid and electron-donating group positions relative to each other: `'c1cc([OX2H,NX3H2])ccc1C(=O)O'`, ensuring the electron-donating group is at the para position.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Rule 14** - The 'bulky_group' is defined as `'[CX4]'`, which represents any tetravalent carbon, including small groups like methyl, which are not considered bulky. Redefine 'bulky_group' to match truly bulky substituents. For example, use `'[CX4]([CX4])[CX4]'` for tert-butyl groups or include common bulky groups explicitly, such as isopropyl (`'C(C)C'`) or tert-butyl (`'C(C)(C)C'`).

- **Suggestion 11**: **Rule 15** - The SMARTS pattern `'C(=O)O[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]'` matches a specific chain length of four carbons after the carboxylic acid. Generalize the pattern to match any even-numbered straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acid. Use a recursive SMARTS pattern like `'C(=O)O([CH2][CH2]){n}'` where `n` is any integer, and enforce the condition that the total number of carbons is even. Also, consider aliphatic chains without any branching or functional groups.

- **Suggestion 12**: **General** - Review all SMARTS patterns to ensure they are not overly specific and can match a variety of structures described by the natural language rules. Use SMARTS syntax features like repetition (`{n,m}`), recursive smarts (`$()`) and logical operators to make patterns more general and accurate.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids containing both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups result in high yield.**  
  *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid)  
  *Rationale*: The presence of both amino and multiple carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield; those with simple aromatic side chains result in low yield.**  
  *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)  
  *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)  
  *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers and participate in electron delocalization, enhancing reactivity, while simple aromatic rings lack this ability.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids containing an amino group directly attached to the ring result in high yield.**  
  *Example*: 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: The amino group at the para position can donate electron density to the ring and interact favorably with the catalyst, enhancing activity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with mercapto (sulfanyl) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, whereas modifiers with mercapto groups on aromatic rings result in low yield.**  
  *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Aliphatic mercapto groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability, while aromatic mercapto groups may lead to catalyst poisoning.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings attached to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar modifiers with shorter chains result in low yield.**  
  *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid  
  *Low Yield Examples*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and distance that favor interactions with the catalyst, whereas shorter chains may cause steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity.**  
  *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Perfluorinated groups can decrease solubility and disrupt interactions with the catalyst, hindering the reaction.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.**  
  *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can coordinate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic carboxylic acids (chains of seven or more carbons) result in low yield.**  
  *Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Terminal functional groups on long chains may interfere with catalyst binding or lead to unfavorable conformations.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains, especially those with adjacent hydroxyl groups, result in high yield.**  
  *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)  
  *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and can form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst, improving its performance.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids, especially with the carboxylic acid at the 3-position, result in high yield.**  
  *Example*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid)  
  *Rationale*: The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, and the 3-position carboxylic acid optimizes this interaction.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids in aliphatic chains result in low yield.**  
  *Example*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid  
  *Rationale*: Ketone groups near carboxylic acids can chelate metal ions, possibly deactivating the catalyst or favoring side reactions.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on aromatic rings at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid tend to result in high yield, unless other inhibitory functional groups are present.**  
  *Example*: 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups increase the electron density of the aromatic ring, enhancing interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aromatic heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield.**  
  *Examples*: 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid  
  *Rationale*: Heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, facilitating catalyst activity.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with directly attached aromatic rings substituted with bulky groups at the para position result in low yield.**  
  *Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Bulky substituents can cause steric hindrance, preventing effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: **Simple straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with an even number of carbons result in high yield, unless terminal functional groups decrease yield.**  
  *Example*: Octanoic acid  
  *Rationale*: Even-chain fatty acids have optimal packing and interaction with the catalyst surface.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns for Rule 2 and Rule 2.1 to ensure mutual exclusivity.** In the current code, both heteroaromatic and simple aromatic rings can match the same molecule (e.g., tryptophan), leading to conflicting predictions. Modify the 'aromatic_ring' pattern in Rule 2.1 to exclude heteroaromatic rings by specifying only carbocyclic aromatic rings. For example, use `'c1ccc(cc1)'` to match benzene rings. Adjust the 'heteroaromatic_ring' pattern in Rule 2 to specifically match heteroaromatic side chains attached to the α-carbon of amino acids. You might use a pattern that includes the side chain linkage, such as `'[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` followed by a heteroaromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Ensure that SMARTS patterns for Rules 2 and 2.1 focus on the side chain attached to the α-carbon.** Include the α-amino acid backbone in your patterns to prevent matching aromatic rings elsewhere in the molecule. For Rule 2.1, adjust the pattern to match an α-amino acid with a simple aromatic side chain: `'[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CH2][c1ccccc1]'`. For Rule 2, adjust the pattern for heteroaromatic side chains accordingly.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Expand the SMARTS pattern for Rule 5 to accurately represent aliphatic chains of four or more carbons connecting an aromatic ring to a carboxylic acid.** The current pattern `'c[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]'` is too simplified and may not capture the required structures. Modify the pattern to `'c[CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` to ensure that the aliphatic chain has at least four carbons and terminates with a carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Improve the SMARTS pattern for Rule 10 to detect pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxylic acid at the 3-position.** The current pattern `'n1ccccc1C(=O)O'` may fail if the carboxylic acid is not directly connected as specified. Use a more flexible pattern such as `'n1cc(C(=O)[OX2H1])ccc1'` to match pyridine rings with a carboxylic acid specifically at the 3-position. Alternatively, use substructure matching to identify the nitrogen position and the carboxylic acid relative to it.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 15 to match straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with an even number of carbons greater than two.** The current pattern `'[CX4H2][CX4H2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` only matches acids with two carbons before the carboxyl group. Modify the pattern to include variable-length even-numbered carbon chains, such as `'[CX4H3][CX4H2]{n}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`, where `n` can be set to match an even number of repetitions (e.g., 2, 4, 6).

- **Suggestion 6**: **Implement logic to prevent conflicting predictions when rules are mutually exclusive.** For example, if a molecule matches Rule 2 (high yield due to heteroaromatic side chain), ensure that it cannot also match Rule 2.1 (low yield due to simple aromatic side chain). Add checks in the code to assign predictions based on priority or hierarchy of rules.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Use more specific SMARTS patterns to capture the exact structural features described in the rules.** For instance, in Rule 3, specify that the amino group is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid on the aromatic ring by using a pattern like `'c1ccc(N)cc1C(=O)[OX2H1]'`. This ensures that only molecules with the amino group in the correct position are matched.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Handle exceptions or additional inhibitory functional groups as mentioned in the rules.** For rules like Rule 12, include logic to check for other functional groups that may negate the positive effect of electron-donating groups. This will improve the specificity and accuracy of the predictions.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Validate and test each SMARTS pattern individually against known examples.** Use a set of test molecules where the expected outcome is known to ensure that each pattern matches correctly. This will help identify any shortcomings or errors in the SMARTS patterns.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Consider using chemoinformatics libraries with more advanced features for pattern matching.** Libraries like RDKit offer functionalities such as recursive SMARTS, atom mapping, and property calculations that can enhance the specificity of your patterns and rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify Rules into Quantifiable Structural Features**  
  Reframe the rules to focus on specific functional groups or structural motifs that can be directly identified and counted from SMILES strings. For example, instead of qualitative descriptions like "modifiers with heteroaromatic side chains," define the presence of specific heteroatoms in aromatic rings (e.g., nitrogen in a six-membered ring).

- **Advice 2**: **Develop Binary Indicators for Key Functional Groups**  
  Create binary features indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of functional groups mentioned in the rules, such as amino groups, carboxylic acids, hydroxyl groups, mercapto groups, aldehydes, ketones, and specific ring systems. This approach allows for straightforward encoding into a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify Chain Lengths and Branching**  
  For rules involving chain lengths (e.g., Rules 5 and 8), numerically encode the number of carbons in aliphatic chains and include features for branching patterns. This quantification can help model the impact of chain length on yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Assign Numerical Values to Electronic Effects**  
  Utilize known chemical scales (e.g., Hammett sigma constants) to assign numerical values to electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups. This will translate qualitative assessments of electronic effects into quantitative features.

- **Advice 5**: **Include Steric Parameters**  
  Quantify steric hindrance by calculating molecular descriptors such as molar volume or using Taft steric parameters. This can capture the impact of bulky groups on catalyst interaction as mentioned in Rules 5 and 14.

- **Advice 6**: **Use Cheminformatics Tools for Descriptor Generation**  
  Employ cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit) to compute molecular descriptors like molecular weight, LogP, topological polar surface area (TPSA), and others. These descriptors can capture aspects of solubility and hydrophobicity relevant to Rules 6 and 9.

- **Advice 7**: **Generate Molecular Fingerprints**  
  Create molecular fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) from the SMILES strings to capture substructural information. These can serve as high-dimensional numerical features that represent the presence of various functional groups and structural motifs.

- **Advice 8**: **Quantify Heteroatom Content and Coordination Sites**  
  Calculate the count of heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, S) and potential coordination sites (e.g., lone pairs, π-systems) that may interact with the metal catalyst. This aligns with the rationale in Rules 2, 3, 4, 10, and 13.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate 3D Descriptors if Possible**  
  If computational resources allow, include three-dimensional molecular descriptors such as molecular surface area, volume, and shape descriptors. These can provide insights into steric effects and catalyst accessibility.

- **Advice 10**: **Standardize Modifier Representation**  
  Ensure all modifiers are represented in a consistent format, possibly by canonicalizing SMILES strings and verifying tautomeric forms. This consistency is crucial for accurate descriptor calculation.

- **Advice 11**: **Create Composite Features**  
  Combine related descriptors to form composite features that capture more complex interactions. For example, multiply the number of carboxylic acid groups by chain length to represent the overall acidity along the chain.

- **Advice 12**: **Encode Aromaticity and Ring Systems**  
  Include features that specify the presence of aromatic rings, heteroaromatic rings, and the types of ring systems (e.g., six-membered, five-membered). This directly relates to Rules 2, 3, 7, and 13.

- **Advice 13**: **Consider Hydrogen Bond Donor and Acceptor Counts**  
  Calculate the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in each modifier, as these can affect interactions with the catalyst and solvent, impacting yield.

- **Advice 14**: **Quantify Hydrophilicity/Hydrophobicity Balance**  
  Use descriptors like the octanol-water partition coefficient (LogP) to quantify the hydrophilic or hydrophobic nature of the modifiers, relevant to Rules 6 and 9.

- **Advice 15**: **Implement Machine Learning Feature Selection**  
  After generating a wide range of numerical features, apply feature selection techniques (e.g., recursive feature elimination, LASSO regression) to identify the most relevant features that correlate with yield.

**End of Advice**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (amino acids with two carboxyl groups) result in high yield.**

  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance through chelation.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with amino or nitro groups directly attached to the ring result in high yield; those with aldehyde (formyl), methyl, or mercapto groups at the same position result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amino and nitro groups can enhance electronic interactions with the catalyst, while formyl, methyl, and mercapto groups may hinder these interactions or cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with heteroaromatic carboxylic acids, especially pyridine derivatives, result in high yield when the carboxylic acid is positioned to favor coordination.**

  - *Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (6 to 8 carbons) result in high yield unless terminal functional groups interfere.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Medium-length chains provide optimal hydrophobic interactions without introducing steric hindrance from terminal groups.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains result in low yield.**

  - *Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Terminal polar groups on long chains may interfere with catalyst binding or lead to undesirable interactions, reducing yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains, especially adjacent hydroxyls, result in high yield.**

  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and can form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst, improving performance.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with mercapto (thiol) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with mercapto groups on aromatic rings result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity, whereas aromatic thiols may lead to catalyst poisoning or deactivation.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to their strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity.**

  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated groups decrease solubility and disrupt interactions with the catalyst, hindering the reaction.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups on aromatic rings result in low yield.**

  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can coordinate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings connected to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar modifiers with shorter chains result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and appropriate spacing for optimal interactions with the catalyst, whereas shorter chains may cause steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance.**

  - *Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups can prevent effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing adjacent ketone or amide groups to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**

  - *Examples*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Ketone and amide groups near the carboxylic acid can chelate metal ions or interfere with catalytic activity, leading to reduced yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains, such as indole or pyrrole rings, result in high yield; those with simple aromatic side chains result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers and facilitate electron delocalization, enhancing reactivity, while simple aromatic rings lack these capabilities.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with polyglycol ether chains result in low yield due to their high flexibility and potential to interfere with catalyst binding.**

  - *Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt conformations that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst, reducing yield.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with electron-rich heterocycles or conjugated keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids result in high yield.**

  - *Examples*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heterocycles and conjugated keto groups can stabilize metal centers and enhance catalytic activity through favorable electronic interactions.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows us to determine if a modifier is an α-amino dicarboxylic acid, leading to high yield. It is supported by at least two data points and includes adequate property insight with a reasonable rationale. The complexity is acceptable, focusing on specific substructures.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** provides clear structural descriptions for high and low yield modifiers based on para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids. It is well-supported by data, with multiple examples for both high and low yield. The rule includes physical-chemical rationale and balances complexity with coverage.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear in identifying heteroaromatic carboxylic acids, especially pyridine derivatives, that result in high yield when the positioning favors coordination. The rule is supported by sufficient data points and provides an adequate rationale regarding coordination with metal centers.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** clearly defines modifiers as aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (6 to 8 carbons) resulting in high yield unless terminal functional groups interfere. The rule is supported by data with both high and low yield examples. The property insight and rationale are adequate.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear and overlaps with Rule 4 in addressing the effect of terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains resulting in low yield. Supported by data, it provides adequate insight into how these groups may interfere with catalyst binding.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** identifies modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains, especially adjacent hydroxyls, resulting in high yield. However, the rule has limited coverage, as it is primarily supported by a single data point. While the clarity and rationale are acceptable, the low coverage may weaken its validity.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** distinguishes between modifiers with mercapto groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) versus aromatic rings (low yield). The rule is clear and provides rationale, but the coverage is limited to one data point for each case, which may affect its strength.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** describes modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains resulting in low yield. The rule is clear with a strong rationale; however, it is only supported by a single data point, which may limit its generalizability.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde groups on aromatic rings result in low yield, supported by at least two data points. The physical-chemical rationale is provided, and the rule is acceptable in terms of clarity and complexity.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** addresses modifiers with aromatic rings connected to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of varying lengths, affecting yield. The rule is clear and supported by data, though coverage is limited to one example for each case. The rationale is acceptable.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** states that modifiers with bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance. While the rule is clear, it is supported by only one data point, limiting its coverage.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** indicates that modifiers containing adjacent ketone or amide groups to the carboxylic acid result in low yield. The rule is clear, well-supported by two data points, and includes a reasonable rationale.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** contrasts amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains (high yield) against those with simple aromatic side chains (low yield). The rule is clear and supported by data points, with an adequate rationale involving coordination and electronic effects.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** involves modifiers with polyglycol ether chains resulting in low yield. The rule is clear, includes a rationale, and is supported by at least two data points, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** identifies that modifiers with electron-rich heterocycles or conjugated keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids result in high yield. The rule is clear, supported by data, and provides property insight through the rationale.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (amino acids with two carboxyl groups) result in high yield.**

  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance through chelation.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with amino or nitro groups directly attached to the ring result in high yield; those with aldehyde (formyl), methyl, or mercapto groups at the same position result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amino and nitro groups can enhance electronic interactions with the catalyst, while formyl, methyl, and mercapto groups may hinder these interactions or cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with heteroaromatic carboxylic acids, especially pyridine derivatives, result in high yield when the carboxylic acid is positioned to favor coordination.**

  - *Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (6 to 8 carbons) result in high yield unless terminal functional groups interfere.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Medium-length chains provide optimal hydrophobic interactions without introducing steric hindrance from terminal groups.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains result in low yield.**

  - *Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Terminal polar groups on long chains may interfere with catalyst binding or lead to undesirable interactions, reducing yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains, especially adjacent hydroxyls, result in high yield.**

  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and can form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst, improving performance.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with mercapto (thiol) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with mercapto groups on aromatic rings result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity, whereas aromatic thiols may lead to catalyst poisoning or deactivation.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to their strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity.**

  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated groups decrease solubility and disrupt interactions with the catalyst, hindering the reaction.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups on aromatic rings result in low yield.**

  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can coordinate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings connected to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar modifiers with shorter chains result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and appropriate spacing for optimal interactions with the catalyst, whereas shorter chains may cause steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance.**

  - *Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups can prevent effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing adjacent ketone or amide groups to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**

  - *Examples*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Ketone and amide groups near the carboxylic acid can chelate metal ions or interfere with catalytic activity, leading to reduced yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains, such as indole or pyrrole rings, result in high yield; those with simple aromatic side chains result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers and facilitate electron delocalization, enhancing reactivity, while simple aromatic rings lack these capabilities.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with polyglycol ether chains result in low yield due to their high flexibility and potential to interfere with catalyst binding.**

  - *Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt conformations that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst, reducing yield.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with electron-rich heterocycles or conjugated keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids result in high yield.**

  - *Examples*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heterocycles and conjugated keto groups can stabilize metal centers and enhance catalytic activity through favorable electronic interactions.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Correct the way counts are handled in Rule 1.** The current implementation uses `Chem.MolToSmarts(pat)` as a key to retrieve the count from the `counts` dictionary. However, `Chem.MolToSmarts(pat)` may not return the original SMARTS string due to internal rearrangements or standardizations, leading to a mismatch in keys. Instead, maintain a consistent mapping between the pattern objects and their required counts. For example, store the counts with the pattern objects themselves or use indices to ensure accurate retrieval.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Combine multiple SMARTS patterns into a single pattern when applicable.** For Rule 1, instead of using separate patterns for the alpha-amino group and the carboxylic acid group, create a single comprehensive SMARTS pattern that captures amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups. For example, use a pattern like `N[C@@H](C(=O)O)C(=O)O` to match α-amino dicarboxylic acids directly.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Refine SMARTS patterns to accurately reflect the natural language rules.** Review each SMARTS pattern for correctness and specificity. For instance, in Rule 2, ensure that the patterns for para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with specific groups correctly identify the substituents in the para position. Adjust patterns to explicitly define positions on the aromatic ring if necessary.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Improve handling of substructure counts in the code.** For rules requiring a certain number of substructures (e.g., multiple hydroxyl groups in Rule 6), implement a more reliable method to count occurrences. Use `mol.GetSubstructMatches(pat, uniquify=False)` and count the number of matches directly, comparing it with the required count.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Modify the code to handle recursive SMARTS for better pattern specificity.** Use recursive SMARTS patterns to capture more complex substructures, such as modifiers with heteroaromatic rings in Rule 3. This can improve the accuracy of pattern matching for molecules with intricate features.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Add diagnostic output to assist in debugging pattern matches.** Incorporate logging statements or print the matches found for each pattern and molecule. This will help identify where patterns may not be matching as expected and facilitate adjustments to the SMARTS patterns or code logic.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Reevaluate the logic for exclude patterns and counts in the matching process.** Ensure that exclude patterns are correctly applied before confirming a match. Likewise, verify that counts are only considered when the corresponding patterns have matched, and adjust the matching sequence in the code accordingly.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Test the code with known examples to validate rule implementations.** Use the examples provided in each rule to test whether the code correctly identifies high and low yield modifiers. Adjust the SMARTS patterns or code logic based on these test results to improve accuracy.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Standardize molecule representations before pattern matching.** Use RDKit's molecule sanitization and standardization functions to ensure that tautomers, protonation states, and stereochemistry are consistently represented, which can affect substructure matching.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Consider using molecular descriptors or fingerprinting for complex patterns.** For rules involving electronic effects or steric hindrance (e.g., Rules 11 and 15), molecular descriptors or fingerprints might capture these features more effectively than SMARTS patterns alone.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

The current set of rules exhibits notable improvements in performance metrics on the training data, particularly in terms of **confidence** and **lift**. Below is a detailed comparison of the current metrics with the reference (previous) metrics, focusing on these two key indicators.

---

**Comparison of Metrics: Previous vs. Current**

1. **Support**:
   - **Previous Train Support (average)**: 
     \[(0.1667 + 0.1845) / 2 = 17.56\%\]
   - **Current Train Support**: 
     \(10.23\%\)
   - **Interpretation**: The current rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset compared to the previous rules. A lower support indicates that while the rules are more specific, they apply to fewer instances within the data.

2. **Confidence**:
   - **Previous Train Confidence (average)**: 
     \[(63.52\% + 53.96\%) / 2 = 58.74\%\]
   - **Current Train Confidence**: 
     \(64.62\%\)
   - **Interpretation**: There is an improvement in confidence with the current rules. Higher confidence suggests that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of the predicted outcome is greater.

3. **Lift**:
   - **Previous Train Lift (average)**: 
     \[(1.2048 + 1.0559) / 2 = 1.1304\]
   - **Current Train Lift**: 
     \(1.2845\)
   - **Interpretation**: The increase in lift indicates that the current rules are more effective at predicting the outcome compared to the average probability. A lift greater than 1 shows that the rule is useful in identifying cases with higher than average occurrence of the outcome.

4. **Leverage**:
   - **Previous Train Leverage (average)**: 
     \[(0.0289 + (-0.0041)) / 2 = 0.0124\]
   - **Current Train Leverage**: 
     \(0.0095\)
   - **Interpretation**: The leverage is positive but slightly lower than before. Positive leverage means the rule has a higher occurrence than would be expected if the items were independent, indicating a genuine association.

---

**Observations and Insights**

- **Improved Confidence and Lift**: The current rules have higher confidence and lift values, indicating better predictive accuracy and effectiveness on the training data. This suggests that the rules are more reliable when they are applicable.

- **Reduced Support**: The decrease in support means the rules are applicable to a smaller subset of data. While this specificity can lead to higher confidence, it may also limit the rules' usefulness by not covering enough cases.

- **Leverage Consideration**: The slight decrease in leverage suggests that while the association between the rule conditions and the outcome is still positive, it is not as strong as before in terms of additional support over chance.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Potential Overfitting**: The significant increase in confidence and lift on the training data, coupled with decreased support, may indicate that the rules are becoming too tailored to the training data, potentially capturing noise rather than underlying patterns.

- **Lack of Test Metrics**: Without corresponding metrics on a test dataset, it's challenging to determine if these improvements will generalize to new, unseen data. In the previous metrics, test data showed a substantial drop in performance, highlighting possible overfitting.

- **Local Minimum Consideration**: Given that only training metrics have improved, it's premature to conclude that a local minimum has been reached. The absence of validation on test data means that further iterations and adjustments are likely necessary.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Evaluate on Test Data**:
   - **Action**: Apply the current rules to a test dataset to obtain corresponding metrics (support, confidence, lift, leverage).
   - **Rationale**: Assessing performance on unseen data is crucial to determine if the rules generalize well or if they are overfitting the training data.

2. **Increase Rule Support**:
   - **Action**: Re-examine the rules to find opportunities to generalize conditions without significantly reducing confidence and lift.
   - **Strategies**:
     - **Simplify Overly Specific Conditions**: Modify rules that are too narrow to cover more instances.
     - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge rules with overlapping conditions or outcomes to improve support.
   - **Rationale**: Enhancing support increases the applicability of the rules, making them more valuable for prediction.

3. **Balance Specificity and Generalizability**:
   - **Action**: Adjust rules to strike a balance between being specific enough to maintain high confidence and general enough to apply to more data points.
   - **Rationale**: Overly specific rules may not perform well on new data, while overly general rules may lack predictive power.

4. **Cross-Validation**:
   - **Action**: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the robustness of the rules across different subsets of the data.
   - **Rationale**: Enhances the reliability of the evaluation by ensuring that the rules perform consistently across various samples.

5. **Analyze Rule Redundancy and Interaction**:
   - **Action**: Identify and eliminate redundant rules or those with conflicting outcomes.
   - **Rationale**: Simplifying the rule set can prevent confusion and improve overall performance by focusing on the most impactful rules.

6. **Incorporate Additional Features**:
   - **Action**: Explore introducing new relevant features or modifying existing ones to capture more significant patterns.
   - **Rationale**: Enriching the feature set can provide more information for the rules to leverage, potentially increasing support and predictive power.

7. **Monitor for Overfitting**:
   - **Action**: Regularly compare training and test performance during iterations.
   - **Rationale**: Keeping an eye on both sets of metrics helps prevent overfitting by ensuring that improvements on training data also reflect on test data.

8. **Iterative Refinement with Feedback Loops**:
   - **Action**: Implement a systematic approach to refining rules based on performance feedback.
   - **Rationale**: An iterative process allows for continuous improvement and adjustment based on empirical evidence.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules have shown improvement in confidence and lift on the training data, indicating better predictive accuracy for the cases they cover. However, the reduced support and lack of test data evaluation raise concerns about their generalizability and potential overfitting.

To enhance the effectiveness of the rules:

- **Validation on Test Data** is crucial to determine their true predictive capability.
- **Increasing Support** without substantially sacrificing confidence and lift will make the rules more broadly applicable.
- **Balancing Specificity and Generalizability** ensures the rules are not only accurate but also useful in practice.

Further iterations, guided by comprehensive evaluation and a focus on these areas, are recommended to achieve an optimal set of rules that perform well on both training and unseen data.

ML Commenter Message:
**Comments on Accuracies of the Validation Set and Train Set:**

The current iteration yields a 5-fold validation accuracy of **0.6857**, which is a noticeable decrease compared to the previous validation accuracies consistently hovering around **0.76**. The previous reference metrics are as follows:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies**:
  - [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - [0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625
  - [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625

The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be as effective in capturing the underlying patterns in the data compared to the previous iterations. This decline indicates potential issues with the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data, which is critical for accurate predictions.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

To understand the impact of individual rules on the model's predictions, we analyzed the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for each molecule in the validation set. The SHAP values help identify how each rule contributes to the predicted loading levels of modifiers on the catalyst.

**Discrepancies Identified:**

We identified several molecules where the predicted loadings did not match the experimental values. Key discrepancies include:

1. **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecule**: *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
     - **Significant SHAP Contributions**:
       - **Rule 5**: SHAP = 0.1921
       - **Rule 10**: SHAP = 0.0434
       - **Rule 11**: SHAP = 0.0453

   - **Molecule**: *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*
     - **Significant SHAP Contributions**:
       - **Rule 5**: SHAP = 0.1921
       - **Rule 9**: SHAP = 0.0216

   - **Molecule**: *C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O*
     - **Significant SHAP Contribution**:
       - **Rule 7**: SHAP = 0.5282

2. **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - **Molecule**: *C(CCN)CC(=O)O*
     - **Significant SHAP Contributions**:
       - **Rule 5**: SHAP = -0.4062
       - **Rule 7**: SHAP = -0.1237

   - **Molecule**: *C(C(=O)O)NC(CO)(CO)CO*
     - **Significant SHAP Contributions**:
       - **Rule 5**: SHAP = -0.3399
       - **Rule 7**: SHAP = -0.1776

   - **Molecule**: *C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O*
     - **Significant SHAP Contributions**:
       - **Rule 5**: SHAP = -0.3399
       - **Rule 7**: SHAP = -0.1776

**Interpretation of the SHAP Analysis:**

- **Rule 5** consistently exhibits high positive SHAP values for molecules with overestimated loadings and high negative SHAP values for molecules with underestimated loadings. This indicates that **Rule 5** is significantly influencing the model's predictions, often inaccurately.
  
- **Rule 7** also shows significant SHAP contributions, particularly in cases where the model's predictions are incorrect.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the model may be **underfitting** the data. The current rules may not be capturing the complexity of the relationships between molecular structures and catalyst loadings. Additionally, the over-reliance on certain rules (e.g., Rule 5 and Rule 7) may indicate an imbalance in the feature importance, leading to skewed predictions.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules:**

The current rules, particularly **Rule 5** and **Rule 7**, are not performing effectively:

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains result in low yield.
  - The rule seems too broad and may be incorrectly penalizing or rewarding molecules, leading to misclassifications.
  
- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with mercapto (thiol) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield; those on aromatic rings result in low yield.
  - The significant positive and negative SHAP values associated with this rule suggest that it may not be accurately distinguishing between high-yielding and low-yielding modifiers.

Given the model's decreased accuracy and the identified discrepancies, it appears we may have reached a local minimum in the model's performance. Further iterations are necessary to refine the rules and improve the model's predictive capabilities.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Rule 5:**

   - **Issue Identified**: Rule 5 is contributing significantly to incorrect predictions, both overestimations and underestimations.
   - **Suggested Refinement**:
     - **Reevaluate the Chain Length Criterion**: Consider specifying the optimal chain length or range where terminal amino or hydroxyl groups impact the yield.
     - **Incorporate Contextual Functional Groups**: Analyze whether the presence of additional functional groups or molecular context alters the effect of terminal amino or hydroxyl groups.
     - **Example**:
       - Modifiers with terminal amino groups on aliphatic chains longer than six carbons may result in low yield, whereas shorter chains may not have the same effect.

2. **Adjust Rule 7:**

   - **Issue Identified**: Rule 7's impact is inconsistent, leading to significant misclassifications.
   - **Suggested Refinement**:
     - **Differentiate Between Aliphatic Chain Lengths**: Examine whether the position of the mercapto group along the chain (e.g., terminal vs. internal) affects the yield.
     - **Consider Aromatic Rings with Substituted Thiol Groups**: Determine if specific substitutions on aromatic rings mitigate the negative impact of mercapto groups.
     - **Example**:
       - Modifiers with internal mercapto groups on short aliphatic chains may result in high yield, while terminal mercapto groups on longer chains do not.

3. **Enhance Generalization:**

   - **Address Underfitting**: Introduce additional rules or modify existing ones to capture more nuances in the data.
   - **Reduce Overreliance on Specific Rules**: Balance the influence of different rules to prevent any single rule from disproportionately affecting the outcome.
   - **Incorporate Statistical Analysis**: Use statistical methods to validate the significance of each rule and adjust their weighting accordingly.

4. **Use Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Identify Overlapping Rules**: Look for rules that may be redundant or conflicting and consolidate them for clarity.
   - **Prioritize Rules with Consistent SHAP Contributions**: Focus on refining rules that consistently contribute positively to correct predictions.
   - **Iteratively Test Rule Adjustments**: Implement small changes to the rules and evaluate their impact on the model's performance through subsequent iterations.

5. **Consider Additional Features:**

   - **Integrate Molecular Descriptors**: Beyond the current rules, incorporate quantitative molecular descriptors (e.g., electronegativity, steric hindrance metrics) to provide a more comprehensive feature set.
   - **Machine Learning Feature Importance**: Analyze other feature importance metrics to identify potential areas for rule enhancement.

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules requires refinement to improve the model's predictive accuracy. By focusing on adjusting **Rule 5** and **Rule 7**, which have been identified as significant contributors to mispredictions, we can enhance the model's performance. Additionally, addressing the potential underfitting by introducing more nuanced rules and balancing the influence of existing ones will help the model generalize better to new data. Utilizing insights from the SHAP analysis judiciously will guide the iterative process of rule refinement, ultimately leading to a more robust and accurate predictive model for catalyst modifier loadings.

Project Manager Message:
**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

**1. Overview**

You are managing a project aimed at optimizing the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols. The reaction utilizes a catalyst, Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe), whose performance is influenced by molecular modifiers attached to the catalyst's metal-organic layer (MOL). Your goal is to extract rules from SMILES representations of these modifiers to predict and control the reaction yield effectively.

**2. Current Rule Metrics and Performance**

- **Improved Confidence and Lift**: The current rules show an increase in training confidence from approximately 58.74% (previous average) to 64.62%, and an increase in training lift from about 1.13 to 1.28. This suggests that when these rules apply, they have a higher probability of correctly predicting high yields compared to the average case.

- **Reduced Support**: The training support has decreased from an average of around 17.56% to 10.23%, indicating that the current rules are more specific and cover fewer instances in the dataset.

- **Leverage**: The training leverage remains positive (0.0095), confirming a genuine association between the rule conditions and high yields, although slightly reduced compared to previous metrics.

**3. SHAP Analysis and Rule Effectiveness**

- **Discrepancies in Predictions**: The SHAP analysis revealed that certain rules, particularly **Rule 5** and **Rule 7**, are contributing significantly to incorrect predictions. For example:
  - Molecules where the model overestimates yield (predicts high when experimental value is low) often have high positive SHAP values from these rules.
  - Molecules where the model underestimates yield (predicts low when experimental value is high) often have high negative SHAP values from these rules.

- **Impact of Specific Rules**:
  - **Rule 5**: Modifiers with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains result in low yield.
  - **Rule 7**: Modifiers with mercapto (thiol) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield; those on aromatic rings result in low yield.
  - These rules may be too general or incorrectly defined, leading to misclassification.

**4. Accuracy Concerns**

- **Validation Accuracy Decline**: The current 5-fold validation accuracy is **68.57%**, down from previous accuracies of **75-76%**. This decrease suggests that the model may not generalize well to unseen data and that the rules may need refinement.

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

**1. Refine Rules Showing Inconsistent Performance**

- **Rule 5**:
  - **Issue**: Overly broad and contributes to incorrect predictions.
  - **Suggestions**:
    - **Specify Chain Length**: Define what constitutes a "long" aliphatic chain (e.g., more than six carbons).
    - **Consider Position of Functional Groups**: Differentiate between terminal and internal amino or hydroxyl groups.
    - **Include Contextual Factors**: Evaluate how adjacent functional groups or branching influence the yield.

- **Rule 7**:
  - **Issue**: Inconsistent SHAP contributions leading to mispredictions.
  - **Suggestions**:
    - **Clarify Mercapto Group Effects**: Reassess how mercapto groups influence yield based on their position (e.g., terminal vs. internal) and the nature of the chain (aliphatic vs. aromatic).
    - **Account for Substituents**: Examine if other substituents on the ring alter the effect of mercapto groups.

**2. Improve SMARTS Patterns and Pattern Matching**

- **Correct Handling of Substructure Counts**:
  - Ensure counts of substructures are accurate by associating counts directly with pattern objects rather than relying on potentially inconsistent keys.
  
- **Refine SMARTS Patterns**:
  - **Combine Patterns When Appropriate**: For example, merge patterns for α-amino dicarboxylic acids to capture the specific structure in a single pattern.
  - **Ensure Specificity**: Adjust patterns to match only the intended structures, using recursive SMARTS or position-specific descriptors as needed.
  
- **Enhance Code for Pattern Matching**:
  - **Use Reliable Counting Methods**: Utilize functions like `mol.GetSubstructMatches(pat, uniquify=False)` to count pattern occurrences accurately.
  - **Apply Exclude Patterns Correctly**: Verify that exclude patterns are checked before confirming a match to prevent false positives.

**3. Increase Rule Support Without Sacrificing Confidence**

- **Generalize Rules Judiciously**:
  - Slightly broaden rules to cover more instances while maintaining high confidence.
  - For example, adjust chain length criteria or functional group requirements to include more relevant modifiers.

- **Combine Overlapping Rules**:
  - Merge similar rules to simplify the rule set and increase coverage.
  - Ensure that the combined rule maintains or improves predictive performance.

**4. Utilize SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement**

- **Identify Influential Rules**:
  - Focus on rules that consistently have high positive SHAP values for correct predictions.
  
- **Balance Rule Contributions**:
  - Adjust the weighting or influence of rules to prevent overreliance on any single rule, which can lead to overfitting.

**5. Validate on Test Data**

- **Assess Generalizability**:
  - Apply the refined rules to a separate test dataset to evaluate performance.
  - Monitor metrics like test accuracy, confidence, and lift to ensure that improvements in training data translate to unseen data.

**6. Incorporate Additional Features or Descriptors**

- **Use Molecular Descriptors**:
  - Include features such as electronegativity, steric hindrance parameters, or hydrophobicity indices to capture properties not fully described by SMARTS patterns.
  
- **Explore Fingerprinting Methods**:
  - Utilize molecular fingerprints that can capture substructure patterns and similarities between molecules.

**7. Iterative Testing and Refinement**

- **Test with Known Examples**:
  - Use the examples provided in the rules to validate whether the refined rules make correct predictions.
  
- **Continue Refinement**:
  - Adjust rules based on testing outcomes and re-evaluate until performance metrics indicate an optimal balance between accuracy and generalizability.

**Possibility for Further Optimization**

Yes, there is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By addressing the issues identified with specific rules and improving the pattern matching process, we can enhance the model's predictive accuracy and generalizability. Refining the rules to be both specific and broadly applicable will help in achieving better performance on both training and unseen data.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 5 to Specify Chain Length and Functional Group Position**

  - **Issue**: Rule 5 is overly broad, leading to incorrect predictions. It currently states that modifiers with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains result in low yield.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Define "Long" Aliphatic Chains**: Specify that "long" refers to aliphatic chains with more than **eight carbons**. Chains shorter than this may not have the same negative effect.
    - **Clarify Functional Group Position**: Emphasize that terminal amino or hydroxyl groups at the **omega (ω) position** (last carbon) are associated with low yield.
    - **Update Rule 5**:
      
      **Revised Rule 5**: *Modifiers with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains longer than eight carbons (ω-amino or ω-hydroxy fatty acids) result in low yield.*
    - **Adjust SMARTS Pattern**:
      - Use a SMARTS pattern that specifically matches ω-functionalized fatty acids:
        ```
        [CX4;H2][CX4;H2][CX4;H2][CX4;H2][CX4;H2][CX4;H2][CX4;H2][CX4;H2][CX3](O)C(=O)O
        ```
        This pattern matches aliphatic chains with eight or more carbons ending with a terminal amino or hydroxyl group.
  
- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rule 7 to Account for the Entire Molecular Context**

  - **Issue**: Rule 7 contributes to mispredictions due to oversimplification. It states that modifiers with mercapto groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, and those on aromatic rings result in low yield.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Consider Adjacent Functional Groups**: Recognize that the position of the mercapto group relative to other functional groups affects yield.
    - **Include Chain Length and Substituents**: Specify that short-chain aliphatic mercapto acids (e.g., three to five carbons) result in high yield, while longer chains or additional substituents may reduce yield.
    - **Update Rule 7**:
      
      **Revised Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (three to five carbons) with a mercapto group at the β or γ position result in high yield. Modifiers with mercapto groups on aromatic rings or in other positions result in low yield.*
    - **Adjust SMARTS Pattern**:
      - Use a more specific pattern for high-yield mercapto acids:
        ```
        O=C(O)CC[SH]
        ```
        This pattern matches a carboxylic acid with a mercapto group two carbons away (β position).
  
- **Advice 3**: **Improve SMARTS Patterns by Enhancing Specificity and Accuracy**

  - **Issue**: Current SMARTS patterns may not accurately capture the intended substructures or count occurrences correctly.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Use Unique SMARTS Identifiers**: Ensure that each SMARTS pattern is uniquely identified and accurately matches the intended substructures.
    - **Correct Substructure Counting**: Use RDKit functions like `mol.GetSubstructMatches(pattern, uniquify=False)` to count all matches.
    - **Implement Exclude Patterns Properly**: Apply exclude patterns before confirming a match to prevent false positives.
    - **Example**:
      - For α-amino dicarboxylic acids in Rule 1, combine patterns to capture both amino and dicarboxylic acid functionalities adjacent to each other:
        ```
        [NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[O-])[CX3](=O)[O-]
        ```
  
- **Advice 4**: **Increase Rule Support by Generalizing Where Appropriate**

  - **Issue**: The current rules have low support, covering fewer instances and leading to overfitting.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Identify Common Functionalities**: Look for patterns among high-yield modifiers that can be generalized without losing predictive power.
    - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge overlapping rules to increase support.
    - **Example**:
      - Combine Rules 2 and 3 to create a generalized rule for aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups in the para position:
        
        **New Rule**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., amino, nitro, pyridyl) at the para position result in high yield.*
      - Adjust SMARTS pattern accordingly to include various electron-withdrawing groups at the para position.

- **Advice 5**: **Utilize SHAP Analysis to Refine and Validate Rules**

  - **Issue**: Certain rules may have unintended effects on predictions.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Analyze SHAP Contributions**: Use SHAP values to identify rules that frequently contribute to incorrect predictions.
    - **Adjust Rule Weighting**: Reduce the influence of problematic rules or revise them based on insights from SHAP analysis.
    - **Validate Changes**: Test the impact of rule adjustments on model predictions and SHAP values to ensure improvement.

- **Advice 6**: **Validate Refined Rules on Separate Test Data**

  - **Issue**: The decline in validation accuracy suggests overfitting to the training data.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Split Data Properly**: Ensure that the dataset is split into training and test sets without overlap.
    - **Assess Performance Metrics**: Compare training and test accuracies to evaluate generalizability.
    - **Iterate as Necessary**: Refine rules further if test accuracy does not improve.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints**

  - **Issue**: Reliance solely on SMARTS patterns may overlook important molecular features.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Use Molecular Descriptors**: Include features like logP (hydrophobicity), molecular weight, and topological polar surface area.
    - **Employ Fingerprints**: Use molecular fingerprints (e.g., ECFP4) to capture substructural information.
    - **Integrate with Existing Rules**: Combine descriptor-based models with rule-based predictions for better accuracy.

- **Advice 8**: **Iteratively Test and Refine Rules**

  - **Issue**: One-time adjustments may not fully resolve issues.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Perform Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance reliably.
    - **Update Rules Based on Results**: Continuously refine rules based on validation outcomes.
    - **Document Changes**: Keep detailed records of rule adjustments and their effects on performance for traceability.

- **Advice 9**: **Review and Adjust Other Rules for Consistency**

  - **Issue**: Other rules may also benefit from refinement.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Re-express Chain Lengths Explicitly**: For rules involving chain lengths (e.g., Rule 4 and Rule 10), specify exact carbon counts.
    - **Clarify Functional Group Effects**: For rules involving functional groups (e.g., aldehydes in Rule 9), consider steric and electronic factors in more detail.
    - **Ensure Mutual Exclusivity**: Check that rules do not conflict or overlap in ways that cause confusion in the model.

- **Advice 10**: **Enhance Rule Justifications with Chemical Insights**

  - **Issue**: Stronger rationales can guide better rule formulation.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Incorporate Chemical Principles**: Use knowledge of coordination chemistry, electronic effects, and steric hindrance to justify rules.
    - **Consult Literature**: Reference studies or precedents where similar structures have shown specific effects on catalysis.

**End of Advice**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (amino acids with two carboxyl groups) result in high yield.**

  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows strong chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance through effective coordination.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with substituents capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino or nitro groups) result in high yield; those with non-coordinating substituents (e.g., methyl) or potentially interfering groups (e.g., aldehyde, mercapto) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Substituents that can coordinate with metal centers enhance catalyst activity by facilitating electron transfer, while non-coordinating or interfering groups may hinder catalyst performance through steric hindrance or side reactions.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms positioned to coordinate with metals result in high yield; those with steric hindrance or unfavorable positioning result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Steric hindrance or improper positioning of the nitrogen can reduce this coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (6 to 8 carbons) result in high yield if they lack interfering terminal functional groups; the presence of terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on such chains results in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Medium-length aliphatic chains without polar terminal groups enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, improving binding. Terminal polar groups may disrupt catalyst binding or introduce unfavorable electronic effects.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains, especially adjacent hydroxyls, result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst through hydrogen bonding.**

  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and enable extensive hydrogen bonding with the catalyst, improving catalyst-modifier interactions and catalytic performance.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with mercapto (thiol) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with mercapto groups on aromatic rings result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can form strong, flexible bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may lead to catalyst poisoning or deactivation due to stronger, less flexible binding or side reactions.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-rich heterocycles or conjugated keto groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in high yield.**

  - *Examples*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heterocycles and conjugated keto groups can delocalize electrons and coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through favorable electronic interactions.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains (e.g., indole rings) result in high yield; those with simple aromatic side chains (e.g., phenyl rings) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic side chains can coordinate with metal centers and facilitate electron transfer, enhancing reactivity. Simple aromatic rings lack this coordinating ability.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated groups reduce electron density and solubility, disrupting interactions with the catalyst and decreasing yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential coordination with metal centers or side reactions that deactivate the catalyst.**

  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or undergo oxidation, interfering with catalytic activity and reducing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings connected to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and optimal spacing for effective interactions with the catalyst, while shorter chains may cause steric hindrance or limit necessary conformational adjustments.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance that impedes catalyst interaction.**

  - *Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups obstruct access to the catalyst's active sites, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier binding and thus decreasing yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with polyglycol ether chains result in low yield due to their high flexibility and potential to interfere with catalyst binding through non-specific interactions.**

  - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt conformations that hinder effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing adjacent ketone or amide groups to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield, as these groups may chelate metal ions or interfere with catalytic sites.**

  - *Examples*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Ketone and amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong chelating interactions with metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst or blocking active sites.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with trifluoroacetyl groups result in low yield due to their strong electron-withdrawing effects, which reduce electron density and disrupt beneficial interactions with the catalyst.**

  - *Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease the availability of electrons for coordination with the catalyst, hindering catalyst performance and reducing yield.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 addresses modifiers with electron-rich heterocycles or conjugated keto groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid. While it provides physical-chemical insight, the criteria are somewhat broad, potentially affecting clarity. The rule considers complex combinations of sub-structures. It is supported by at least two data points—1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid—but could benefit from more precise definitions to improve clarity without compromising complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly distinguishes modifiers based on the nature of the amino acid side chains, providing solid physical-chemical insight into how heteroaromatic side chains enhance reactivity. It considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by at least two data points—(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (high yield) and (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (low yield). The rule is balanced between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear about the negative impact of perfluorinated alkyl chains on yield, with adequate physical-chemical insight regarding electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity. However, it is supported by only one data point—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid—which does not satisfy the coverage criterion. Additional supporting data would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly identifies modifiers with aldehyde groups directly attached to aromatic rings as resulting in low yield. The physical-chemical insight is sufficient, explaining potential catalyst deactivation. It is supported by at least two data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—meeting the coverage requirement. The rule is well-balanced.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 effectively distinguishes modifiers based on the length of aliphatic chains connecting aromatic rings to carboxylic acids. It is clear and provides good physical-chemical insight. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by data points like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (high yield) and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 addresses bulky substituents on aromatic rings leading to low yield, with clear criteria and physical-chemical insight about steric hindrance. It is supported by only one data point—4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (low yield)—which does not meet the coverage requirement. Including additional examples would improve the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear in stating that polyglycol ether chains result in low yield, offering physical-chemical insight into flexibility and non-specific interactions. It is supported by at least two data points—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid—fulfilling the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly specifies that adjacent ketone or amide groups to the carboxylic acid function lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, addressing chelation and interference with catalytic sites. Supported by 4-oxoheptanedioic acid and (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, it meets the coverage requirement and is well-balanced.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 identifies trifluoroacetyl groups as leading to low yield due to electron-withdrawing effects. While the rule is clear and provides physical-chemical insight, it is supported by only one data point—4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid. This does not meet the coverage criterion, and additional examples would strengthen the rule.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Merge Rules with Similar Themes to Improve Coverage and Reduce Redundancy.**  
  Examine rules that share common features or address similar structural elements and consider combining them. For example, merge **Rule 4** and **Rule 5** since both discuss aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains and the impact of terminal functional groups. This consolidation will enhance clarity and broaden the coverage of the rules.

- **Advice 2**: **Strengthen Rules with Limited Data Support by Incorporating Additional Examples.**  
  For rules supported by only one data point (e.g., **Rule 5**, **Rule 9**, **Rule 12**, **Rule 15**), search for additional modifiers in the dataset or literature that fit these criteria. Adding more examples will bolster the validity of the rules and ensure they meet the coverage criterion.

- **Advice 3**: **Clarify and Specify Structural Criteria in Broad or Vague Rules.**  
  Some rules, like **Rule 7** (modifiers with electron-rich heterocycles or conjugated keto groups), are broad and may benefit from more precise definitions. Specify which heterocycles or conjugated systems are beneficial by providing clear structural criteria and examples. This will improve the rule's applicability and predictive power.

- **Advice 4**: **Explicitly Address Exceptions and Boundary Cases in the Rules.**  
  Identify any known exceptions or boundary cases that do not fit the general trend of a rule. For instance, if certain bulky substituents do not adversely affect yield despite being large, mention these in **Rule 12**. Including exceptions enhances the robustness and accuracy of the rules.

- **Advice 5**: **Simplify Overly Complex Rules to Enhance Usability.**  
  Evaluate rules that may be too intricate or detailed, and simplify them without losing essential information. For example, streamline **Rule 7** by focusing on the most influential functional groups. Simplified rules are easier to use and apply to real-world scenarios.

- **Advice 6**: **Ensure Consistent Terminology and Definitions Across All Rules.**  
  Review the language used in the rules to maintain consistency in terminology, such as "metal coordination," "electron-donating groups," and "steric hindrance." Consistent language improves understanding and prevents misinterpretation.

- **Advice 7**: **Enhance Physical-Chemical Rationales with More Detailed Explanations.**  
  Deepen the rationales by providing more detailed mechanistic insights. For instance, elaborate on how electron-donating groups enhance metal coordination or how steric hindrance specifically affects catalyst interaction. Richer explanations increase the educational value of the rules.

  Expand the dataset to include more diverse modifiers, especially those that can test the boundaries of the current rules. A richer dataset will allow for the development of more comprehensive and universally applicable rules.

- **Advice 11**: **Consider Negative Examples in High-Yield Rules and Vice Versa.**  
  For each rule predicting high yield, explicitly mention any known modifiers that fit the criteria but result in low yield, and explore why they are exceptions. This approach will refine the rules and improve their predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 12**: **Validate Rules with Computational Chemistry or Additional Experiments.**  
  Where possible, support the rules with computational modeling or further experimental data. Validation strengthens the credibility of the rules and provides a solid foundation for their application.

- **Advice 13**: **Align Rules with Practical Synthesis Considerations.**  
  Ensure that the rules consider not only theoretical aspects but also practical synthesis factors such as availability of modifiers, cost, and ease of handling. This practical focus will make the rules more valuable to users in real-world applications.

- **Advice 14**: **Encourage Feedback from Users to Continuously Improve the Rules.**  
  Establish a mechanism for users to provide feedback on the rules' applicability and accuracy. User insights can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that the rules remain relevant and useful.

- **Advice 15**: **Document the Development Process of the Rules for Transparency.**

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (amino acids with two carboxyl groups) or amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows strong chelation with metal centers. Heteroaromatic side chains (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) can coordinate with metals, enhancing catalyst performance. Simple aromatic side chains or additional amide groups may not provide effective coordination or may interfere with catalyst binding.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with substituents capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) result in high yield; those with non-coordinating or interfering substituents (e.g., methyl, formyl, mercapto) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Substituents that can coordinate with metal centers or activate the aromatic ring enhance catalyst activity by facilitating electron transfer. Non-coordinating groups or those that can deactivate the catalyst reduce yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms appropriately positioned to coordinate with metals result in high yield; those with steric hindrance or poor nitrogen positioning result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Steric hindrance or improper positioning of nitrogen atoms reduces coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (6 to 8 carbons) lacking terminal polar groups result in high yield; the presence of terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on such chains results in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted medium-length aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, improving binding. Terminal polar groups can disrupt these interactions or introduce unfavorable electronic effects.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst through hydrogen bonding.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and enable extensive hydrogen bonding with the catalyst, improving catalyst-modifier interactions and catalytic performance.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with mercapto (thiol) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with mercapto groups on aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can form flexible, beneficial interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or cause catalyst deactivation.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-rich conjugated systems adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in high yield due to effective coordination with metal centers.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich systems can delocalize electrons and coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through favorable electronic interactions.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated groups reduce electron density and solubility, disrupting interactions with the catalyst and decreasing yield.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyglycol ether chains result in low yield due to non-specific interactions that interfere with catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt conformations that hinder effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring or carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through strong chelation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups near coordination sites can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or undergo oxidation, interfering with catalytic activity and reducing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings connected to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and optimal spacing for effective interactions with the catalyst, while shorter chains may cause steric hindrance or limit necessary conformational adjustments.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance that impedes catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups obstruct access to the catalyst's active sites, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier binding and thus decreasing yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with trifluoroacetyl or other strongly electron-withdrawing groups result in low yield due to decreased electron density that hinders coordination with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease the availability of electrons for coordination with the catalyst, hindering performance and reducing yield.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential chelation that deactivates the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong chelating interactions with metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains terminated with amino or hydroxyl groups on medium-length chains (6 to 8 carbons) result in low yield due to disruption of hydrophobic interactions needed for effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Terminal polar groups on medium-length chains disrupt hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, decreasing binding affinity and catalytic efficiency.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows one to predict high yield when modifiers are α-amino dicarboxylic acids or amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains. The property insight is strong, explaining the importance of chelation with metal centers and coordination via heteroaromatic groups. The rule combines multiple sub-structures, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid, tryptophan for high yield; phenylalanine and 6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid for low yield), fulfilling the coverage requirement. Overall, Rule 1 is balanced and meets all criteria effectively.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in distinguishing high yield modifiers as para-substituted benzoic acids with metal-coordinating substituents versus low yield ones with non-coordinating substituents. The property insight appropriately explains the role of these substituents in metal coordination and electron transfer. The rule considers both the core structure and specific substituents, adding complexity. It is supported by several data points on both high and low yields, satisfying the coverage criterion. Rule 2 is well-balanced and meets the criteria satisfactorily.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides clear guidance on heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms positioned for effective metal coordination resulting in high yield. The property insight is solid, highlighting the importance of nitrogen positioning and steric factors. The rule incorporates complexity by combining heteroaromatic rings and functional group positioning. It is supported by multiple data points, including both high and low yield examples, fulfilling the coverage requirement. Rule 3 is balanced and meets the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly states that medium-length aliphatic carboxylic acids without terminal polar groups yield high results, while those with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups yield low results. The property insight regarding hydrophobic interactions is appropriate. The rule combines chain length and terminal functionality, satisfying complexity. It is supported by multiple data points for both outcomes, meeting the coverage criterion. Rule 4 is balanced and meets all criteria satisfactorily.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 suggests that modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding. While the rule is clear and provides property insight, it is supported by only one data point (gluconic acid), which does not fully satisfy the coverage criterion. Additional data points are needed to strengthen this rule's reliability. Therefore, Rule 5 partially meets the criteria but requires more data for full validation.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in differentiating between the effects of mercapto groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) versus aromatic rings (low yield). The property insight is logical, explaining differences in flexibility and binding strength. The rule combines functional group presence and location, adding complexity. It is supported by two data points, satisfying the minimum coverage requirement. Rule 6 meets the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 indicates that electron-rich conjugated systems adjacent to the carboxylic acid function lead to high yield. While the property insight is relevant, the rule's definition is somewhat broad, potentially affecting clarity. It is supported by two data points but may benefit from further specificity to enhance applicability. Rule 7 partially meets the criteria but could be improved by refining its clarity.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 states that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity. The rule is clear and provides property insight; however, it is supported by only one data point, which does not satisfy the coverage criterion. Additional data would strengthen the rule. Therefore, Rule 8 does not fully meet the criteria due to limited coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly specifies that modifiers with flexible polyglycol ether chains result in low yield due to interference with catalyst binding. The property insight appropriately explains this effect. The rule considers specific structural features, satisfying complexity, and is supported by multiple data points, meeting the coverage requirement. Rule 9 is balanced and meets all criteria satisfactorily.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear in stating that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to key functional areas result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation. The property insight is logical, and the rule combines structural features, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by several data points, satisfying coverage. Rule 10 is balanced and meets the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly differentiates modifiers based on the length of aliphatic chains connecting aromatic rings to carboxylic acids, with longer chains resulting in high yield. The property insight is sound, and the rule considers combined structural features, satisfying complexity. It is supported by data points showing both high and low yields, meeting the coverage criterion. Rule 11 is balanced and meets all criteria effectively.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 states that modifiers with bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance. While the rule is clear and provides property insight, it is supported by only one data point, which does not fulfill the coverage criterion. More data points are needed for validation. Therefore, Rule 12 does not fully meet the criteria due to limited coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 indicates that modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups result in low yield due to decreased electron density hindering catalyst coordination. The rule is clear with appropriate property insight but is supported by only one data point. Additional data is necessary to satisfy the coverage criterion. Hence, Rule 13 does not fully meet the criteria due to insufficient coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly states that modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation. The property insight is logical, and the rule combines structural features, fulfilling complexity. It is supported by multiple data points, meeting the coverage criterion. Rule 14 is balanced and meets all criteria effectively.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 specifies that modifiers with medium-length aliphatic chains terminated with amino or hydroxyl groups result in low yield due to disruption of hydrophobic interactions. The property insight is appropriate. The rule considers both chain length and terminal functionality, adding complexity. It is supported by several data points, fulfilling the coverage requirement. Rule 15 is balanced and meets all criteria satisfactorily.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (amino acids with two carboxyl groups) or amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows strong chelation with metal centers. Heteroaromatic side chains (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) can coordinate with metals, enhancing catalyst performance. Simple aromatic side chains or additional amide groups may not provide effective coordination or may interfere with catalyst binding.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with substituents capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) result in high yield; those with non-coordinating or interfering substituents (e.g., methyl, formyl, mercapto) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Substituents that can coordinate with metal centers or activate the aromatic ring enhance catalyst activity by facilitating electron transfer. Non-coordinating groups or those that can deactivate the catalyst reduce yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms appropriately positioned to coordinate with metals result in high yield; those with steric hindrance or poor nitrogen positioning result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Steric hindrance or improper positioning of nitrogen atoms reduces coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (6 to 8 carbons) lacking terminal polar groups result in high yield; the presence of terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on such chains results in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted medium-length aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, improving binding. Terminal polar groups can disrupt these interactions or introduce unfavorable electronic effects.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst through hydrogen bonding.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and enable extensive hydrogen bonding with the catalyst, improving catalyst-modifier interactions and catalytic performance.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with mercapto (thiol) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with mercapto groups on aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can form flexible, beneficial interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or cause catalyst deactivation.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-rich conjugated systems adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in high yield due to effective coordination with metal centers.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich systems can delocalize electrons and coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through favorable electronic interactions.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated groups reduce electron density and solubility, disrupting interactions with the catalyst and decreasing yield.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyglycol ether chains result in low yield due to non-specific interactions that interfere with catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt conformations that hinder effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring or carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through strong chelation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups near coordination sites can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or undergo oxidation, interfering with catalytic activity and reducing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings connected to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and optimal spacing for effective interactions with the catalyst, while shorter chains may cause steric hindrance or limit necessary conformational adjustments.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance that impedes catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups obstruct access to the catalyst's active sites, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier binding and thus decreasing yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with trifluoroacetyl or other strongly electron-withdrawing groups result in low yield due to decreased electron density that hinders coordination with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease the availability of electrons for coordination with the catalyst, hindering performance and reducing yield.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential chelation that deactivates the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong chelating interactions with metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains terminated with amino or hydroxyl groups on medium-length chains (6 to 8 carbons) result in low yield due to disruption of hydrophobic interactions needed for effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Terminal polar groups on medium-length chains disrupt hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, decreasing binding affinity and catalytic efficiency.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Implement 'alternative_patterns' Handling**  
  The current code does not process 'alternative_patterns' within the rules. For instance, Rule 1 includes 'alternative_patterns' to capture amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains. The code should be modified to handle 'alternative_patterns' by checking if either the main 'patterns' or the 'alternative_patterns' match, resulting in a positive prediction.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Correctly Identify Amino Acids with Heteroaromatic Side Chains in Rule 1**  
  Update the code for Rule 1 to ensure it captures amino acids like tryptophan. This can be achieved by processing 'alternative_patterns' and ensuring that the SMARTS patterns correctly identify heteroaromatic side chains connected to the α-carbon of amino acids.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Review and Refine SMARTS Patterns for Accurate Matching**  
  Examine each SMARTS pattern used in the code to ensure they accurately represent the functional groups and structural features described in the natural language rules. For example, the 'alpha_amino_acid' pattern should be refined to account for stereochemistry and variations in side chains.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Implement Logical Operators and Connectivity in SMARTS Patterns**  
  Modify the code to handle logical operators (AND, OR) within patterns and to specify connectivity between different substructures. Use recursive SMARTS or adjust the patterns to ensure that connected features (e.g., side chains attached to specific atoms) are correctly matched.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Adjust Chain Length Specifications in Rule 4 and Rule 15**  
  The SMARTS pattern '[CH2]6-8' is not valid as SMARTS does not support range quantifiers like regular expressions. Instead, construct patterns that represent aliphatic chains of specific lengths by explicitly specifying the number of repeats or using recursive SMARTS.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Refine Pattern Counting Logic for 'min_count' and 'max_count'**  
  Ensure that the code accurately counts the occurrences of substructures when 'min_count' or 'max_count' are specified. Implement checks that count the number of unique matches and compare them to the required minimum or maximum counts.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Improve Terminal Group Identification**  
  The current method for identifying terminal groups by checking if an atom has only one neighbor may not be accurate in all cases. Use SMARTS patterns that specifically match terminal functional groups, possibly by including explicit hydrogen counts or by matching end-group environments.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Revise Patterns for Substituent Positioning in Aromatic Systems**  
  For rules like Rule 2 and Rule 11, which involve para-substitution or chain lengths connected to aromatic rings, the SMARTS patterns need to precisely define the position of substituents. Use SMARTS annotations to specify ortho/meta/para positions and to accurately represent the attachment points.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Handle Electron-Withdrawing Groups and Steric Hindrance in SMARTS**  
  For rules involving electronic effects (e.g., Rule 13) or steric hindrance (e.g., Rule 12), enhance the SMARTS patterns to detect these features. This may involve identifying specific functional groups known to be electron-withdrawing or defining bulky substituents more precisely.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Add Error Handling and Debugging Information**  
  Incorporate logging or print statements to output intermediate results, such as which patterns matched or failed for each molecule. This will help in debugging and verifying that the code works as intended.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: **Consult RDKit Documentation for Advanced Pattern Matching**  
  Review the RDKit documentation on SMARTS and substructure search capabilities to leverage advanced features like recursive SMARTS, atom maps, and smarts matching options that can improve pattern accuracy.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: **Test the Code with Known Examples**  
  Before applying the code to the full dataset, test it using molecules with known outcomes for each rule. This will help validate that each rule is correctly implemented and that the predictions align with expectations.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: **Modularize the Code for Reusability and Clarity**  
  Break down the code into functions for pattern matching, counting, and prediction to make it more readable and maintainable. This modular approach will facilitate updates and troubleshooting.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: **Ensure Consistent Use of Atom and Bond Properties**  
  Verify that the SMARTS patterns correctly account for atom properties (such as hybridization, formal charge, and valence) and bond properties (such as bond order and ring membership) to improve matching accuracy.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: **Re-validate the Feature Matrix After Code Modifications**  
  Once the code has been updated, regenerate the feature matrix and cross-check it against the rules and known examples to confirm that the transformations are now effective.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Features**  
  Convert the existing qualitative rules into quantifiable molecular features that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers with medium-length chains (6 to 8 carbons) result in high yield," specify "Count of aliphatic carbons in the longest continuous chain between 6 and 8."

- **Advice 2**: **Use Specific Substructure Patterns (SMARTS)**  
  Define precise substructure patterns using SMARTS notation that can be matched in SMILES strings. This allows for automated identification of functional groups and structural motifs relevant to yield outcomes. For instance, represent carboxylic acid groups as "[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,1]".

- **Advice 3**: **Develop a Numerical Feature Matrix**  
  Create a feature matrix where each modifier is represented by numerical values corresponding to the presence or counts of functional groups, atoms, and structural features (e.g., number of amino groups, number of rings, presence of heteroatoms). This facilitates the application of statistical and machine learning models.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Standard Molecular Descriptors**  
  Use cheminformatics software to calculate standard molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD), and acceptors (HBA). These descriptors are numerical and can be directly used in predictive models.

- **Advice 5**: **Quantify Electronic and Steric Effects**  
  Assign numerical values to electronic properties (e.g., Hammett sigma constants for substituents) and steric parameters (e.g., Taft steric constants). This allows for the assessment of how electronic donation or withdrawal and steric hindrance influence the yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Simplify and Generalize Rules**  
  Reduce the complexity of the rules by focusing on the most impactful molecular features. For example, generalize "Modifiers with electron-rich conjugated systems adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in high yield" to "High electron density near the carboxyl group correlates with high yield," and quantify electron density accordingly.

- **Advice 7**: **Define Clear Thresholds and Cutoffs**  
  Establish numerical thresholds for features that differentiate high and low yields. For instance, "Modifiers with more than two hydrogen bond donors result in high yield," or "Modifiers with a LogP between X and Y favor high yield."

- **Advice 8**: **Automate Feature Extraction from SMILES**  
  Utilize software to automatically extract defined features from SMILES strings. This ensures consistency and efficiency in data processing, making it easier to handle larger datasets and integrate new modifiers into the analysis.

- **Advice 9**: **Create a Scoring System for Modifiers**  
  Develop a quantitative scoring system where modifiers are scored based on the sum of weighted feature values. This approach translates qualitative observations into a numerical score that predicts yield outcomes.

- **Advice 10**: **Integrate Machine Learning Models**  
  Employ machine learning algorithms to analyze the numerical feature matrix and identify patterns or combinations of features that are most predictive of high yield. This data-driven approach can refine existing rules and uncover new insights.

- **Advice 11**: **Establish Feedback Loop for Rule Refinement**  
  Apply the revised rules and feature matrix to the existing dataset to test their predictive accuracy. Use the results to further refine the rules, ensuring they are practical, accurate, and aligned with the observed data.

- **Advice 12**: **Document Feature Definitions and Calculation Methods**  
  Provide precise documentation for each feature, including how it is calculated and its relevance to yield. This transparency aids in reproducibility and allows others to understand and utilize the rules effectively.

- **Advice 13**: **Consider Solvent and Reaction Conditions**  
  If possible, include numerical descriptors for solvent interactions and reaction conditions that may influence the yield. This holistic approach can improve the predictive power of the models.

- **Advice 14**: **Collaborate with Computational Chemists**  
  Work with computational chemists or cheminformatics experts to ensure that the features chosen are meaningful and that the methods for calculating them are robust.

- **Advice 15**: **Update Rules Based on New Experimental Data**  
  Continuously incorporate new experimental results into the dataset to validate and adjust the rules and predictive models, enhancing their accuracy over time.

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups enhances metal coordination through chelation, improving catalyst interaction. Heteroaromatic side chains (e.g., indole ring) can coordinate with metal ions, further enhancing catalytic activity. Amino acids with non-coordinating side chains or additional amide groups may not interact effectively with the catalyst.

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and reduce solubility, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains result in low yield due to non-specific interactions that interfere with effective catalyst binding.**

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Standardize Molecular Descriptors**  
  Replace qualitative descriptions in the current rules with standardized molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. Use descriptors such as the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, counts of specific functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, thiol), topological polar surface area (TPSA), and ring counts. This will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix for computational analysis.

- **Advice 2**: **Quantify Functional Group Presence**  
  For each modifier, create binary or numerical features indicating the presence and quantity of functional groups important for metal coordination (e.g., count of carboxylic acid groups, presence of heteroatoms like nitrogen or sulfur). This transforms rules like "Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids result in high yield" into quantifiable features such as "Number of carboxylic acid groups ≥ 2" and "Amino group present".

- **Advice 3**: **Encode Aromaticity and Substituent Effects**  
  Encode aromaticity and the presence of substituents on aromatic rings using descriptors like aromatic ring counts and types of substituents (electron-donating or electron-withdrawing). Quantify substituent effects using Hammett sigma constants or electronic parameters that reflect their influence on metal coordination.

- **Advice 4**: **Include Steric Parameters**  
  Quantify steric hindrance by calculating molecular volume or using parameters like the Taft steric constant. This will help in refining rules that mention steric effects, such as "Modifiers with bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield."

- **Advice 5**: **Evaluate Chain Length Numerically**  
  Replace qualitative chain length descriptions with numerical values. For example, express aliphatic chain length explicitly (e.g., "Aliphatic chain length = number of carbons in the longest carbon chain"). This allows rules about chain length, like Rule 4 and Rule 11, to be analyzed quantitatively.

- **Advice 6**: **Calculate Electronic Properties**  
  Use calculated electronic properties such as HOMO-LUMO gap, partial charges, and electron density on coordinating atoms to capture the effects of electron-rich or electron-deficient modifiers. This aligns with rules discussing electron-donating or -withdrawing effects.

- **Advice 7**: **Utilize Molecular Fingerprints**  
  Generate molecular fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) to represent the modifiers in a binary format that captures structural features. This method allows for the comparison of structural similarities and differences computationally.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Hydrophobicity Measures**  
  Quantify hydrophobicity using descriptors like the octanol-water partition coefficient (log P). This is relevant for rules discussing hydrophobic interactions, such as the high yield associated with nonpolar aliphatic chains in Rule 4.

- **Advice 9**: **Simplify and Consolidate Rules**  
  Review and combine overlapping or similar rules to reduce redundancy. For example, consolidate rules regarding electron-rich aromatic systems and metal-coordinating substituents into a single rule with quantifiable descriptors, simplifying the rule set.

- **Advice 10**: **Create a Feature Matrix for Machine Learning**  
  Use the quantified descriptors to create a feature matrix suitable for machine learning models. Each modifier will have a corresponding feature vector, enabling the use of statistical methods to predict yields and identify key contributing factors.

- **Advice 11**: **Validate and Iterate on Rules**  
  After quantifying features and generating the feature matrix, validate the new rules against the dataset. Use statistical analysis to determine which descriptors correlate most strongly with high or low yield. Refine the rules accordingly to improve their predictive power.

- **Advice 12**: **Leverage Cheminformatics Tools**  
  Utilize cheminformatics libraries (e.g., RDKit) to automate the calculation of molecular descriptors from SMILES strings. This ensures accuracy and efficiency in data processing and allows for easy scalability to larger datasets.

- **Advice 13**: **Consider 3D Structure Descriptors**  
  If relevant, include 3D structural descriptors such as molecular conformations, distances between functional groups, and coordination geometries. This could enhance the understanding of steric effects and metal coordination capabilities.

- **Advice 14**: **Document Assumptions and Definitions**  
  Clearly define each descriptor and any thresholds or cut-off values used in the rules. Documenting assumptions ensures transparency and reproducibility, facilitating collaboration and further optimization of the rule set.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with additional carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic α-amino acids) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Dicarboxylic α-amino acids can chelate metal ions through both carboxylate groups and the amino group, enhancing coordination with the catalyst's metal center. This effective chelation improves catalyst interaction and increases yield. Amino acids lacking an additional carboxylate group or with modified amino groups do not provide the same level of coordination, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with metal-coordinating substituents (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with non-coordinating or electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers (such as amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups) enhance the modifier's ability to bind to the catalyst, facilitating electron transfer and improving catalytic activity. Non-coordinating groups or electron-donating substituents do not provide these interactions, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing interactions with the catalyst and increasing yield. If the nitrogen is sterically hindered or not optimally positioned for coordination, as in 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, the effectiveness is reduced, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) lacking polar terminal groups result in high yield; those with terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, improving binding and catalytic performance. Terminal polar groups can disrupt these interactions by introducing polarity and interfering with the optimal alignment of the modifier on the catalyst surface, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups increases the potential for hydrogen bonding with the catalyst, enhancing the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity, leading to higher yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol (mercapto) groups result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. In contrast, aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to non-specific interactions that disrupt effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that hinder proper orientation and binding of the modifier to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may introduce additional non-specific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions and leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease the electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst and reducing yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential competition with the catalyst binding sites.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong interactions through hydrogen bonding or coordination with metal centers, potentially blocking or competing with the catalyst's active sites. This competition reduces the effectiveness of catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide the necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains may restrict these interactions due to steric hindrance or insufficient length for optimal alignment, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic rings directly connected to each other result in low yield due to steric hindrance that impedes catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The direct connection of bulky aromatic rings can hinder access to the catalyst's active sites, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier binding. This steric hindrance limits the interactions necessary for catalytic activity, leading to lower yield.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with additional carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic α-amino acids) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Dicarboxylic α-amino acids can chelate metal ions through both carboxylate groups and the amino group, enhancing coordination with the catalyst's metal center. This effective chelation improves catalyst interaction and increases yield. Amino acids lacking an additional carboxylate group or with modified amino groups do not provide the same level of coordination, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with metal-coordinating substituents (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with non-coordinating or electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers (such as amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups) enhance the modifier's ability to bind to the catalyst, facilitating electron transfer and improving catalytic activity. Non-coordinating groups or electron-donating substituents do not provide these interactions, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing interactions with the catalyst and increasing yield. If the nitrogen is sterically hindered or not optimally positioned for coordination, as in 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, the effectiveness is reduced, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) lacking polar terminal groups result in high yield; those with terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, improving binding and catalytic performance. Terminal polar groups can disrupt these interactions by introducing polarity and interfering with the optimal alignment of the modifier on the catalyst surface, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups increases the potential for hydrogen bonding with the catalyst, enhancing the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity, leading to higher yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol (mercapto) groups result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. In contrast, aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to non-specific interactions that disrupt effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that hinder proper orientation and binding of the modifier to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may introduce additional non-specific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions and leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease the electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst and reducing yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential competition with the catalyst binding sites.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong interactions through hydrogen bonding or coordination with metal centers, potentially blocking or competing with the catalyst's active sites. This competition reduces the effectiveness of catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide the necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains may restrict these interactions due to steric hindrance or insufficient length for optimal alignment, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic rings directly connected to each other result in low yield due to steric hindrance that impedes catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The direct connection of bulky aromatic rings can hinder access to the catalyst's active sites, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier binding. This steric hindrance limits the interactions necessary for catalytic activity, leading to lower yield.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Adjust the count threshold mechanism in Rule 1 to correctly match patterns.** The current code in Rule 1 uses `'count_threshold': {'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]': 2}` to specify that at least two carboxylic acid groups must be present. However, during pattern matching, the `pat.GetSmarts()` may not return the exact same SMARTS string due to canonicalization, leading to a mismatch when checking `if pat.GetSmarts() in rule['count_threshold']`. To fix this, instead of relying on `pat.GetSmarts()` as the key, assign identifiers to patterns when compiling them and use these identifiers consistently when checking thresholds. Alternatively, use the SMARTS pattern objects themselves as keys (since they are hashable) or compare patterns based on their molecular fingerprints.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Enhance the SMARTS patterns for Rule 1 to accurately capture α-amino acids with additional carboxylic acid groups.** The current patterns `[NX3H2]` for the primary amino group and `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` for the carboxylic acid group may not be specific enough to identify α-amino acids. Consider defining a more specific pattern that captures the amino acid backbone, such as `[NX3][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`, which represents a primary amine attached to a carbon (the α-carbon) that is connected to a carboxylic acid. Additionally, ensure that the code checks for exactly two carboxylic acid groups and that one of them is attached to the α-carbon.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Improve the handling of multiple required patterns (logical AND conditions).** In Rule 1 and other rules, the code needs to confirm that all specified patterns are present in the molecule. Currently, if any pattern in a group matches, `group_match` is set to `True`, but this may not ensure that all necessary patterns are present simultaneously. Modify the code to require that all pattern groups must match at least once for the rule to apply. This might involve changing the logic to:

  ```python
  for compiled_group in rule['compiled_patterns']:
      group_match = all(mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat) for pat in compiled_group)
      if not group_match:
          match = False
          break
  ```

- **Suggestion 4**: **Ensure exclude patterns are correctly applied.** For rules with `exclude_patterns`, verify that any match to an exclude pattern should immediately result in the molecule not matching the rule. In the current code, the logic may not correctly handle multiple exclude patterns within groups. Review and adjust the logic to check all exclude patterns properly and set `match = False` if any are found.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Review and refine SMARTS patterns for other rules to match the natural language descriptions accurately.** For example, in Rule 2, the patterns for metal-coordinating substituents may miss some functionalities or misidentify others. Ensure that the SMARTS patterns for each substituent (amino, nitro, bromomethyl) are precisely defined and that their positions (para-substitution) on the benzoic acid ring are correctly specified. Consider using position-specific SMARTS patterns like `c1ccc(cc1[NX3H2])C(=O)O` for para-amino benzoic acid.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Add explicit matching for positional isomers where necessary.** Some rules depend on substituents being in specific positions (e.g., para-substitution in Rule 2). Adjust the SMARTS patterns to account for these positional requirements, perhaps by annotating the positions on the aromatic ring and specifying the substituents accordingly.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Modify the pattern matching to account for counts of functional groups more robustly.** Instead of relying on SMARTS patterns and count thresholds, consider using molecular descriptors or functions that can count specific substructures. For example, use RDKit's `mol.GetSubstructMatches()` to count occurrences of a functional group and compare it directly to the threshold value without matching SMARTS strings.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Implement comprehensive unit tests for each rule with example molecules.** Create a set of test molecules (both positive and negative examples) for each rule and verify that the code correctly classifies them. This will help identify any discrepancies in pattern matching and rule implementation.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Include stereochemistry considerations if relevant.** Some modifiers may have specific stereochemistry that affects their performance. Ensure that the SMARTS patterns and matching functions account for stereochemical configurations where necessary.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Improve error handling and logging within the code.** Enhance the code to provide informative messages when a molecule cannot be parsed or when a pattern matching fails unexpectedly. This will aid in debugging and refining the rule implementation.

---

**Performance Evaluation**

1. **Support**

   - **Observation**: Train support has decreased significantly from the previous metrics. Initially, the support was around 0.1667 to 0.1845, which then decreased to 0.1023 and currently stands at 0.0167.
   - **Interpretation**: The rules now cover a much smaller portion of the dataset. A lower support indicates that the rules apply to fewer instances in the training data.
   - **Implication**: While high-confidence rules are desirable, excessively low support suggests overfitting to a small subset of data, reducing the rules' general applicability.

2. **Confidence**

   - **Observation**: The train confidence has improved slightly from previous values (0.6352 and 0.5396) to 0.6462 and currently to 0.6806.
   - **Interpretation**: A higher confidence means that when the rule conditions are met, the prediction is more likely to be correct.
   - **Implication**: The increase in confidence is positive, indicating better predictive power of the rules on the instances they cover.

3. **Lift**

   - **Observation**: Lift has increased from around 1.2048 and 1.0559 to 1.2845, and currently to 1.3681.
   - **Interpretation**: A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance.
   - **Implication**: The higher lift suggests that the rules are capturing meaningful associations between the conditions and the predictions.

4. **Leverage**

   - **Observation**: Leverage has decreased from an initial 0.0289 to 0.0095 and now to 0.0071.
   - **Interpretation**: Leverage measures the difference between the observed support and the expected support if the items were independent.
   - **Implication**: Positive but decreasing leverage indicates that while there is an association, the strength of that association relative to chance is diminishing.

---

**Assessment of Current Rules**

- The current rules have **higher confidence and lift**, suggesting improved precision in predicting high yield when the rule conditions are met.
- The **significant decrease in support** indicates that these rules apply to a much smaller fraction of the data.
- The **decrease in leverage** suggests that the additional support the rules receive over what would be expected by chance is minimal.
- Overall, the rules may be becoming **too specific**, potentially capturing noise rather than generalizable patterns.

---

**Evaluation of Iterative Progress**

- **Local Minimum Consideration**: The metrics suggest that we may have reached a local minimum where further iterations are not yielding significant improvements in the overall performance of the rules.
- **Iteration Sufficiency**: Given that confidence and lift have only marginally improved while support and leverage have decreased substantially, it may be time to reassess the approach rather than continue with additional iterations.

---

**Recommendations for Rule Improvement**

1. **Increase Rule Generality**

   - **Action**: Re-express overly specific rules to cover a broader range of compounds without sacrificing too much confidence.
   - **Rationale**: Generalizing rules can increase support, making them more applicable to the dataset and enhancing their practical utility.

2. **Consolidate Similar Rules**

   - **Action**: Identify and merge rules with overlapping conditions or similar structural features.
   - **Rationale**: Consolidation can improve support and simplify the rule set, making it easier to interpret and apply.

3. **Reevaluate Low-Support Rules**

   - **Action**: Reassess rules with extremely low support (e.g., Rule 5 and Rule 12) to determine if they are adding value or merely capturing anomalies.
   - **Rationale**: Removing or modifying rules with minimal coverage can prevent overfitting and improve the robustness of the rule set.

4. **Incorporate Test Metrics**

   - **Action**: Evaluate the rules on a test dataset to assess their generalizability beyond the training data.
   - **Rationale**: Ensuring that rules perform well on unseen data helps confirm that they capture true underlying patterns.

5. **Balance Positive and Negative Rules**

   - **Action**: Ensure that the rule set includes a balanced mix of conditions leading to both high and low yields.
   - **Rationale**: Understanding both favorable and unfavorable conditions provides a more comprehensive insight into the factors affecting yield.

6. **Leverage Domain Knowledge**

   - **Action**: Collaborate with chemists to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules and to identify any overlooked factors.
   - **Rationale**: Expert input can help refine rules based on chemical principles, enhancing their relevance and accuracy.

7. **Feature Engineering**

   - **Action**: Explore additional molecular descriptors or features that may influence catalytic activity, such as electronic properties, steric factors, or solubility.
   - **Rationale**: Incorporating more relevant features can improve the predictive power of the rules.

8. **Avoid Overfitting**

   - **Action**: Implement regularization techniques or pruning strategies to prevent the rules from becoming too tailored to the training data.
   - **Rationale**: Ensuring that the model generalizes well prevents it from capturing noise specific to the training set.

9. **Consider Alternative Algorithms**

   - **Action**: Experiment with other rule-generation algorithms or machine learning models that may capture patterns more effectively.
   - **Rationale**: Different algorithms may uncover associations that are not evident with the current approach.

10. **Cross-Validation**

    - **Action**: Use cross-validation to assess the stability and reliability of the rules across different subsets of the data.
    - **Rationale**: Cross-validation helps in evaluating the performance and robustness of the rules, reducing the likelihood of overfitting.

---

**Specific Suggestions for Current Rules**

- **Rule 1**: While focusing on dicarboxylic α-amino acids, consider whether similar coordination effects are present in other polycarboxylic acids.

- **Rule 2**: Examine the influence of different para-substituents more broadly to see if the rule can be expanded.

- **Rule 4**: Investigate the optimal chain length further; perhaps medium-length chains with certain polar groups may also result in high yield.

- **Rule 8 and Rule 9**: Given their low yield association, assess whether these rules can be generalized to encompass other modifiers with similar disruptive features.

- **Rule 12**: Since this rule has low support, determine if steric hindrance due to other structural features can be integrated to create a more general rule.

---

**Conclusion**

The current iteration of rules shows improved confidence and lift but at the expense of significantly reduced support and leverage. This trade-off suggests that the rules have become too specialized, limiting their applicability. By adjusting the rules to be more general, consolidating overlapping rules, and incorporating domain expertise, we can enhance the balance between precision and coverage. Additionally, evaluating the rules on test data and through cross-validation will help ensure their generalizability and prevent overfitting. These steps should lead to a more robust and practical set of rules that effectively capture the key factors influencing catalytic yield.

ML Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation Set and Train Set**

The performance metrics indicate a notable decline in the predictive accuracy of the classification model over the iterations. Initially, the model displayed a consistent validation accuracy of approximately **76%**, with test accuracies around **75%**, as seen in the reference metrics:

- Validation Accuracies: `[0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]`; Test Accuracy: `0.75`
- Validation Accuracies: `[0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]`; Test Accuracy: `0.75`

In the subsequent iteration, the model's accuracy decreased to **68.57%**:

- Validation Accuracy: `0.6857` (approximate)

In the most recent iteration, the accuracy further declined to **48.57%**:

- Validation Accuracy: `0.4857` (approximate)

This downward trend suggests that the modifications made to the rules for generating the feature matrix have adversely affected the model's performance. The current rules seem less effective in capturing the underlying patterns that dictate the catalyst loading predictions, leading to lower accuracy on both the training and validation sets.

**Analysis Based on the SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions for individual molecules. By examining the SHAP values, we can identify which rules have the most significant positive or negative impact on the predicted catalyst loadings, particularly for cases where the predictions do not align with the experimental values.

**Discrepancies Identified:**

1. **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - **Molecules Affected:**
     - `C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`
     - `C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O`
     - `C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O`
     - `C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)O`
     - `C(C[CH2]CN)CC(=O)O`

   - **Key Observations:**
     - The **predicted loading is low**, but the **experimental value is high**.
     - **Rule 2** consistently has a **negative SHAP value** of approximately `-0.0192` to `-0.0203`.
     - **Rule 9** contributes a **positive SHAP value**, but it is insufficient to change the overall prediction.

   - **Implication:**
     - **Rule 2** may be improperly penalizing these molecules, leading to underestimated loadings.
     - The negative impact of Rule 2 suggests that it might be overly restrictive or misapplied to certain molecular structures.

2. **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecules Affected:**
     - `C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O`
     - `CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O`
     - `C1=CC(=C(C=C1C=O)C(=O)O)O`
     - `C(COCCOCCN)C(=O)O`
     - `CC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`

   - **Key Observations:**
     - The **predicted loading is high**, but the **experimental value is low**.
     - **Rule 7** and **Rule 9** often have **positive SHAP values**, contributing to overestimation.
     - **Rule 9** has a higher positive SHAP value (approximately `0.0378`), significantly influencing the prediction.

   - **Implication:**
     - **Rule 9** may be overemphasizing certain features, leading to overestimated loadings for molecules that do not experimentally exhibit high loading.
     - The consistent positive contribution of Rule 9 indicates it may need refinement to avoid false positives.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

The decline in validation accuracy from **76%** to **48.57%** suggests that the model is potentially **overfitting** to certain aspects of the training data or **underfitting** due to inadequate representation of key features in the rules:

- **Overfitting Indicators:**
  - The model may have become too tailored to specific training examples, reducing its ability to generalize to new data.
  - Overemphasis on certain rules (e.g., Rule 9) could be causing the model to incorrectly predict high loadings.

- **Underfitting Indicators:**
  - The rules may not be capturing essential features, leading to poor performance across both training and validation sets.
  - The simplification or removal of previously effective rules could have diminished the model's predictive capacity.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

The decreasing accuracy metrics suggest that the probability of improvement with the current rules is low unless adjustments are made. The model's inability to maintain or improve upon previous performance levels indicates that the current set of rules may not be effective in capturing the critical factors influencing catalyst loading.

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis**

1. **Rule 2 Issues:**
   - Negative SHAP values for Rule 2 in cases where the experimental loading is high indicate that this rule may be too restrictive or incorrectly penalizing certain molecular features.
   - Rule 2 pertains to **para-substituted benzoic acids with metal-coordinating substituents** leading to high yield, and non-coordinating substituents leading to low yield.

2. **Rule 9 Overemphasis:**
   - Positive SHAP values for Rule 9 in cases where the experimental loading is low suggest that this rule may be overestimating the importance of **fluorinated alkyl chains**, which are supposed to result in low yield.
   - The significant positive contributions of Rule 9 to the predictions indicate a potential mismatch between the rule's intent and its implementation in the feature matrix.

3. **Consistency Across Molecules:**
   - The repetitive patterns in SHAP values across multiple molecules imply that certain rules have a disproportionate impact, overshadowing other relevant features.
   - This imbalance may hinder the model's ability to accurately differentiate between high and low catalyst loadings.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results and SHAP analysis:

- **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
  - The current rules are not effective enough; they fail to capture the nuances of the molecular features that dictate catalyst loading.
  - The decline in accuracy suggests that the modifications have introduced inconsistencies or removed critical predictive elements.

- **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
  - The model may be underfitting due to overly generalized rules that do not sufficiently distinguish between differing molecular structures.
  - Alternatively, overfitting may occur if certain rules (e.g., Rule 9) are given excessive weight, causing the model to misclassify new data.

- **Local Minimum and Iterations:**
  - The decrease in accuracy indicates that a local minimum may have been reached, and the current iteration of rules is not progressing toward improved performance.
  - Additional iterations are necessary to refine the rules further and enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule 2:**

   - **Issue Identified:**
     - Rule 2 yields negative SHAP values in cases where it should contribute positively (e.g., molecules with high experimental loading but low predicted loading).
     - It may be too broadly penalizing molecules that actually fit the criteria for high yield.

   - **Suggested Refinements:**
     - **Expand the Definition:**
       - Revisit the definition of **metal-coordinating substituents** to include a wider range of functional groups that can coordinate with the catalyst.
       - Consider including other substituents such as **hydroxyl, carboxyl, or thiol groups** if they are present in the para position and can facilitate coordination.
     - **Incorporate Steric and Electronic Factors:**
       - Account for the impact of steric hindrance and electronic properties of substituents on metal coordination.
       - Modify the rule to differentiate between substituents based on their size, electron-donating/-withdrawing effects, and coordination ability.

2. **Adjust Rule 9:**

   - **Issue Identified:**
     - Rule 9 contributes positive SHAP values leading to overestimation of loading in molecules where the experimental loading is low.
     - The rule may be misapplied or overly influential in the model.

   - **Suggested Adjustments:**
     - **Clarify the Rule's Scope:**
       - Ensure that Rule 9 correctly identifies and penalizes **only** modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains**.
       - Exclude molecules with only partial fluorination or those where fluorination does not significantly impact catalyst interaction.
     - **Balance Rule Contribution:**
       - Adjust the weighting of Rule 9 in the feature matrix to reduce its disproportionate influence on the predictions.
       - Combine Rule 9 with other relevant features to provide a more nuanced assessment of the molecule's properties.

3. **Review Rule Implementation:**

   - **Identify Redundancies and Conflicts:**
     - Examine the rules for any overlaps or contradictions that may confuse the model.
     - For example, if a molecule satisfies both a rule predicting high loading and another predicting low loading, the net effect may be misleading.

   - **Enhance Specificity:**
     - Make the rules more specific to capture unique structural features that correlate strongly with catalyst loading.
     - Use statistical analysis to identify additional functional groups or structural motifs that are significant predictors.

4. **Improve Generalization:**

   - **Address Overfitting/Underfitting:**
     - Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data.
     - Increase the diversity of the training set to encompass a broader range of molecular structures.

   - **Incorporate Additional Data:**
     - If possible, expand the dataset with more experimental results to improve the model's learning and reduce the impact of outliers.

5. **Iterative Refinement with SHAP Insights:**

   - **Use SHAP Analysis to Guide Rule Modifications:**
     - Continuously monitor the SHAP values associated with each rule to identify patterns and adjust accordingly.
     - Focus on rules that consistently contribute to incorrect predictions.

   - **Validate Changes:**
     - After modifying rules, retrain the model and compare the new performance metrics to ensure that adjustments lead to actual improvements.

6. **Consider New Rules:**

   - **Identify Missing Factors:**
     - Evaluate whether important molecular features are not currently captured by the existing rules.
     - Consider adding new rules to account for factors like **hydrogen bonding capacity**, **steric bulk**, or **π-π interactions**.

   - **Rule Example:**
     - **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with strong hydrogen bond acceptors adjacent to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield.**
       - *Rationale*: Such groups can enhance interaction with the catalyst through additional hydrogen bonding.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules requires refinement to improve the model's accuracy in predicting catalyst loadings. By addressing the issues identified with Rule 2 and Rule 9, enhancing the specificity and balance of the rules, and leveraging insights from the SHAP analysis, we can iteratively improve the model's performance. It is crucial to ensure that the rules are both scientifically sound and effectively implemented within the feature matrix to capture the key determinants of catalyst-modifier interactions.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

---

**1. Summary of Discussions:**

The current task involves optimizing rules derived from SMILES strings to describe the catalytic action of modified catalysts in a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The primary goal is to enhance and control the yield of this reaction by adjusting parameters influenced by different molecular modifiers.

During the analysis, several key observations were made:

- **Rule Metrics Analysis:**
  - **Support Decline:** The train support has significantly decreased over iterations, indicating that the rules now apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.
  - **Confidence and Lift Increase:** Slight improvements in train confidence and lift suggest better precision when the rule conditions are met.
  - **Leverage Decrease:** A reduction in leverage implies that the strength of association relative to chance is diminishing.

- **Accuracy and SHAP Analysis:**
  - **Accuracy Decline:** Validation accuracy has decreased from an initial 76% to approximately 48.57%, indicating a deterioration in the model's predictive performance.
  - **SHAP Values Indicate Model Issues:**
    - **Misapplied Rules:** Some rules, notably Rule 2 and Rule 9, are contributing to incorrect predictions.
    - **Underfitting/Overfitting Concerns:** The model may be underfitting due to inadequate feature representation or overfitting due to overly specific rules.

- **Rule Implementation Challenges:**
  - **Pattern Matching Issues:** Problems with SMARTS pattern matching and counting thresholds have led to incorrect rule applications.
  - **Rule Specificity:** Some rules have become too specific, reducing their general applicability and leading to overfitting.

**2. Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

To address these issues and optimize the current rules, the following suggestions are proposed:

**A. Enhance SMARTS Pattern Definitions:**

1. **Adjust Count Threshold Mechanisms:**
   - Use consistent identifiers or the patterns themselves as keys when checking count thresholds to ensure accurate pattern matching.
   - Example: Instead of relying on `pat.GetSmarts()`, assign a unique key when compiling patterns for tracking purposes.

2. **Refine Patterns for Specific Functionalities:**
   - Develop more specific SMARTS patterns to accurately capture key structural features.
   - For Rule 1, defining α-amino acids with an additional carboxylic acid group can be achieved with a pattern like `[NX3][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`, representing a primary amine attached to the α-carbon connected to a carboxylic acid.

3. **Handle Multiple Required Patterns Correctly:**
   - Modify the logic to ensure that all specified patterns are present simultaneously for a rule to match.
   - Adjust the code to require that all patterns in a group must match, ensuring that the rule conditions are fully satisfied.

**B. Refine Rule Implementation Logic:**

4. **Ensure Exclude Patterns Are Correctly Applied:**
   - Verify that any match to an exclude pattern should immediately prevent the rule from being applied.
   - Review and adjust the logic to check all exclude patterns properly.

5. **Review and Refine SMARTS Patterns for Other Rules:**
   - Reassess SMARTS patterns for all rules to ensure they align accurately with the natural language descriptions.
   - Incorporate positional specificity where necessary, such as para-substitution requirements in aromatic rings.

6. **Include Positional Isomer Considerations:**
   - Adjust SMARTS patterns to account for substituents in specific positions on the ring structures, ensuring accurate matching for position-dependent rules.

**C. Generalize and Consolidate Rules:**

7. **Increase Rule Generality:**
   - Re-express overly specific rules to cover a broader range of compounds without significantly reducing confidence and lift.
   - This approach can increase support and enhance the rules' applicability.

8. **Consolidate Similar Rules:**

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with additional carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic α-amino acids) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Dicarboxylic α-amino acids can chelate metal ions through both carboxylate groups and the amino group, enhancing coordination with the catalyst's metal center. This effective chelation improves catalyst interaction and increases yield. Amino acids lacking an additional carboxylate group or with modified amino groups do not provide the same level of coordination, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with metal-coordinating substituents (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with non-coordinating or electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers (such as amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups) enhance the modifier's ability to bind to the catalyst, facilitating electron transfer and improving catalytic activity. Non-coordinating groups or electron-donating substituents do not provide these interactions, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing interactions with the catalyst and increasing yield. If the nitrogen is sterically hindered or not optimally positioned for coordination, as in 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, the effectiveness is reduced, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) lacking polar terminal groups result in high yield; those with terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, improving binding and catalytic performance. Terminal polar groups can disrupt these interactions by introducing polarity and interfering with the optimal alignment of the modifier on the catalyst surface, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups increases the potential for hydrogen bonding with the catalyst, enhancing the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity, leading to higher yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol (mercapto) groups result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. In contrast, aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to non-specific interactions that disrupt effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that hinder proper orientation and binding of the modifier to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may introduce additional non-specific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions and leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease the electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst and reducing yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential competition with the catalyst binding sites.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong interactions through hydrogen bonding or coordination with metal centers, potentially blocking or competing with the catalyst's active sites. This competition reduces the effectiveness of catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide the necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains may restrict these interactions due to steric hindrance or insufficient length for optimal alignment, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic rings directly connected to each other result in low yield due to steric hindrance that impedes catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The direct connection of bulky aromatic rings can hinder access to the catalyst's active sites, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier binding. This steric hindrance limits the interactions necessary for catalytic activity, leading to lower yield.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance SMARTS Pattern Definitions for Accuracy**
  
  Refine the SMARTS patterns used in the rules to precisely capture the intended chemical functionalities. For example, in **Rule 1** (dicarboxylic α-amino acids), define a SMARTS pattern that matches α-amino acids with an additional carboxylic acid group. A possible pattern could be: `[$([NH2][CH](C(=O)O)[CH2]*C(=O)O)]`, which ensures the presence of both amine and carboxylic acid groups in the correct positions.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust Count Threshold Mechanisms**

  Modify the rule implementation to ensure that count thresholds for pattern matches are correctly applied. Use consistent identifiers or keys for each SMARTS pattern when tracking counts to prevent mismatches or incorrect counts. For instance, utilize unique variable names or pattern objects instead of relying solely on pattern strings.

- **Advice 3**: **Ensure All Required Patterns Are Present Simultaneously**

  Update the logic so that all specified patterns in a rule must match for the rule to apply. Implement checks that confirm the presence of all required functional groups before applying a rule. This will prevent partial matches from incorrectly triggering a rule.

- **Advice 4**: **Apply Exclude Patterns Correctly**

  Verify that exclude patterns are properly integrated into the rule logic. If any exclude pattern matches, the rule should be bypassed, even if the include patterns are present. Review the code to ensure that exclude conditions are prioritized in the matching process.

- **Advice 5**: **Review and Refine SMARTS Patterns for Positional Specificity**

  Reassess the SMARTS patterns for each rule to align them closely with the natural language descriptions, adding positional specificity where necessary. For example, in **Rule 2**, specify para-substitution on aromatic rings by using a pattern like `c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O` for the benzoic acid core and adding substituents at the para position.

- **Advice 6**: **Include Positional Isomer Considerations**

  Incorporate considerations for positional isomers by adjusting SMARTS patterns to target substituents in specific positions on ring structures. This ensures accurate matching for position-dependent rules, such as ortho, meta, or para substitutions on aromatic rings.

- **Advice 7**: **Increase Rule Generality Without Compromising Accuracy**

  Make overly specific rules more general to increase their applicability. Identify common structural features among high-yield modifiers and widen the SMARTS patterns to include these features. For example, broaden **Rule 3** to include heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with metal-coordinating heteroatoms beyond just nitrogen.

- **Advice 8**: **Consolidate Similar Rules to Simplify the Rule Set**

  Merge rules with overlapping conditions or similar structural characteristics to improve support and simplify the rule set. For instance, combine **Rules 3** and **11** if they both deal with modifiers containing aromatic rings connected via aliphatic chains.

- **Advice 9**: **Reevaluate Low-Support or Low-Confidence Rules**

  Review rules with low support or confidence, such as **Rule 12**, to determine if they should be modified or removed. Eliminating ineffective rules can prevent overfitting and enhance the model's overall performance.

- **Advice 10**: **Collaborate with Chemists for Expert Validation**

  Work closely with chemists to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules and to identify any missing factors that affect catalytic performance. Their expertise can help refine rules based on fundamental chemical principles.

- **Advice 11**: **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors**

  Include other molecular descriptors that may influence catalytic activity, such as electronic properties (e.g., Hammett constants), steric parameters, or solubility factors. This can enhance the richness of the rules and improve predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 12**: **Refine Rule 2 for Metal-Coordinating Substituents**

  Expand the definition of metal-coordinating substituents in **Rule 2** to include a broader range of functional groups like hydroxyl, thiol, or pyridyl groups. Adjust the SMARTS patterns accordingly to accurately capture these functionalities.

- **Advice 13**: **Adjust Rule 9 to Target Only Perfluorinated Chains**

  Modify **Rule 9** to specifically penalize modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains, avoiding over-penalization of compounds with fewer fluorine atoms. Ensure the rule’s weighting reflects its relative importance to prevent it from dominating the model unfairly.

- **Advice 14**: **Implement Comprehensive Unit Tests for Rules**

  Create a set of test molecules for each rule, including both positive (should match) and negative (should not match) examples. Use these tests to verify that each rule correctly identifies intended structures and to catch any errors in pattern matching.

- **Advice 15**: **Avoid Overfitting Through Regularization**

  Apply regularization techniques or prune overly specific rules to prevent the model from overfitting the training data. This ensures that the rules generalize well to new, unseen data.

- **Advice 16**: **Use Cross-Validation to Assess Rule Stability**

  Employ cross-validation methods to evaluate the consistency and reliability of the rules across different subsets of the dataset. This will help identify any rules that perform poorly on validation sets and need further refinement.

- **Advice 17**: **Explore Alternative Rule-Generation Algorithms**

  Consider experimenting with other algorithms or machine learning approaches, such as decision trees or association rule learning, which may capture patterns and relationships more effectively than the current method.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward classification of modifiers into high or low yield based on their structures as α-amino dicarboxylic acids or α-amino monocarboxylic acids. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how two carboxylate groups enhance metal chelation and coordination with the catalyst. It considers combinations of functional groups (amino and carboxylate groups at the α position), adding appropriate complexity. The rule is supported by at least three data points (high yield: aspartic acid, glutamic acid; low yield: phenylalanine), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and enables classification of modifiers based on the nature of the para-substituent on benzoic acids, distinguishing between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups. It provides sufficient physical-chemical insight by relating substituents' electronic effects to metal coordination and catalyst binding. The rule incorporates complexity by considering both the aromatic system and the electronic nature of substituents. It is well-supported by multiple data points (high yield: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid; low yield: 4-methylbenzoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly identifies modifiers that will result in high yield by their structures as heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings enhance interaction with the catalyst. It incorporates complexity by considering both the heteroaromatic ring and the coordinating nitrogen atoms. The rule is supported by three high yield data points (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is reasonably clear in distinguishing modifiers based on chain length and the presence of terminal polar groups. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight by relating hydrophobic interactions to catalytic performance and explaining how terminal polar groups can disrupt these interactions. The rule adds complexity by considering chain length and functional group positioning. However, the coverage for high yield examples is limited to one data point (octanoic acid), which may reduce the robustness of the rule. The low yield examples are better represented with three data points (7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), satisfying that aspect of coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and specifies that modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining the role of hydrogen bonding in stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex. It adds complexity by considering the presence and positioning of multiple hydroxyl groups. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (gluconic acid), which does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two supporting data points, reducing confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in distinguishing between modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups (resulting in high yield) and aromatic thiol groups (resulting in low yield). The rule offers adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how aromatic thiols may lead to catalyst poisoning due to strong binding, whereas aliphatic thiols interact beneficially without deactivating the catalyst. It introduces complexity by considering both the nature of the thiol group and the molecular framework. The rule is based on two data points (high yield: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid; low yield: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), meeting the minimal coverage criterion, though more data points would strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and allows for the identification of modifiers that result in low yield based on the presence of carbonyl groups directly attached to aromatic rings. It provides physical-chemical insight by explaining potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions caused by these groups.

It is supported by two low yield data points (4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear in identifying modifiers that result in low yield due to the presence of flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups. The rule offers physical-chemical insight by explaining how such structures hinder effective catalyst binding through non-specific interactions and conformational flexibility. It incorporates complexity by considering both the chain flexibility and functional group effects. The rule is supported by two low yield data points (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in stating that modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining the impact of electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms and increased hydrophobicity on catalyst interaction. It incorporates appropriate complexity by considering the substituent effects of fluorination. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), which does not satisfy the coverage criterion, reducing the confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear in identifying modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function as resulting in low yield. The rule provides physical-chemical insight by explaining how these amide groups can compete with catalyst binding sites. It adds complexity by considering the specific positioning of functional groups. The rule is supported by two low yield data points ((2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly distinguishes modifiers based on the length of the aliphatic chain connecting an aromatic ring to the carboxylic acid. It provides physical-chemical insight by explaining how chain length affects flexibility and interaction with the catalyst. The rule incorporates complexity by considering both the aromatic system and chain length. It is supported by two high yield examples (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) and one low yield example (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly identifies modifiers with bulky aromatic rings directly connected to each other as resulting in low yield due to steric hindrance. The rule offers physical-chemical insight by explaining how steric factors impede catalyst interaction. It introduces complexity by considering the structural arrangement of aromatic rings. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), which does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two supporting data points, reducing confidence in the rule.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield, while α-amino monocarboxylic acids (e.g., phenylalanine) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of two carboxylate groups enhances metal chelation and coordination with the catalyst, improving interaction and increasing yield. Monocarboxylic acids lack this enhanced coordination, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing or metal-coordinating groups (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups enhance the ability of the modifier to interact with metal centers, facilitating better catalyst binding and electron transfer. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and coordination potential, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) lacking terminal polar groups result in high yield; those with terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains promote hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Terminal polar groups disrupt these interactions by introducing polarity, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the potential for hydrogen bonding with the catalyst, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol (–SH) groups result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to non-specific interactions that disrupt effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that hinder proper orientation and binding of the modifier to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups introduce additional non-specific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential competition with the catalyst binding sites.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong interactions through hydrogen bonding or coordination with metal centers, potentially blocking or competing with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains restrict these interactions due to steric hindrance or insufficient length for optimal alignment.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic rings directly connected to each other result in low yield due to steric hindrance that impedes catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Direct connection of bulky aromatic rings hinders access to the catalyst's active sites, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier binding. Steric hindrance limits necessary interactions for catalytic activity.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: Update the `alpha_amino` SMARTS pattern to more accurately represent the α-amino group attached to the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. The current pattern `'[NX3][CX4H]'` does not ensure that the amino group is adjacent to the carboxylic acid. A better pattern would be `'[NX3][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[O;H1]'`, which specifies that the nitrogen is connected to a carbon (`[CX4H]`) that is also connected to another carbon (`[#6]`) and a carboxylic acid group (`[CX3](=O)[O;H1]`).

- **Suggestion 2**: Modify the code's approach to counting functional groups. The current `count_threshold` logic relies on matching SMARTS patterns as strings, which can fail due to differences in how RDKit interprets or formats SMARTS. Instead, associate thresholds directly with the compiled pattern objects or use unique identifiers for each pattern to ensure accurate matching.

- **Suggestion 3**: Ensure that the code checks for connectivity between functional groups as required by the rules. For example, in Rule 1, the two carboxylic acid groups must be part of the same molecule and appropriately positioned (e.g., both attached to the α-carbon or within the same chain). Adjust the SMARTS patterns to enforce these structural relationships.

- **Suggestion 4**: For rules involving positional isomerism (e.g., para-substitution in benzoic acids for Rules 3 and 4), use SMARTS patterns that explicitly define the substitution pattern on the aromatic ring. For instance, specify the para position using SMARTS like `'c1ccc(cc1)[C](=O)[O;H1]'` with appropriate substituents at the correct positions.

- **Suggestion 5**: Refine the `carboxylic_acid` pattern to include both protonated and deprotonated forms and ensure it accurately counts the number of carboxylic acid groups. Confirm that the SMARTS patterns for carboxylic acids are comprehensive and match all relevant functional group representations in the SMILES strings.

- **Suggestion 6**: Rework the logic that applies `count_thresholds`. Instead of checking each pattern individually, sum the counts of all patterns representing the same functional group (e.g., total number of carboxylic acid groups regardless of their protonation state) before comparing to the threshold.

- **Suggestion 7**: Incorporate adjacency and connectivity requirements into the SMARTS patterns to ensure that functional groups are not just present but are connected in the way specified by the rules. Use recursive SMARTS or atom mapping to capture complex structural relationships.

- **Suggestion 8**: Add validation steps that test each rule with known positive and negative examples (the ones provided in the rules). This will help identify mismatches between the rules, the SMARTS patterns, and the code logic.

- **Suggestion 9**: Incorporate detailed logging or debugging statements in the code to output which patterns were matched or not matched for each molecule. This will aid in troubleshooting and ensure that the pattern matching works as intended.

- **Suggestion 10**: Review and adjust all SMARTS patterns for accuracy. Some patterns may be too general or too specific, leading to incorrect matches or misses. Ensure that each SMARTS pattern accurately reflects the functional group or structural feature described in the natural language rules.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Convert Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Features**

  Transform the current qualitative rules into quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids result in high yield," define a feature like "Number of carboxylic acid groups" and "Presence of α-amino group" that can be numerically represented (e.g., 0 or 1). This approach facilitates the creation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize SMARTS Patterns for Functional Group Identification**

  Incorporate SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to identify specific functional groups or substructures mentioned in the rules. For instance, define SMARTS patterns for carboxylic acids, amino groups, thiols, electron-withdrawing groups, and aromatic systems. This allows for automated parsing of SMILES strings to detect these features and encode them numerically.

- **Advice 3**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**

  Review the current rules for overlap and redundancy. Combine similar rules to reduce complexity. For example, rules involving electron-withdrawing groups enhancing yield can be unified. This simplification makes the rules more manageable and the corresponding features easier to encode.

- **Advice 4**: **Focus on Molecular Descriptors That Impact Yield**

  Identify and calculate molecular descriptors known to influence catalytic activity and yield, such as:

  - **Electronic Properties**: Hammett sigma constants, total electron count, partial charges.
  - **Steric Factors**: Molecular volume, steric hindrance parameters.
  - **Hydrophobicity/Hydrophilicity**: LogP values, topological polar surface area (TPSA).
  - **Coordination Ability**: Number of potential coordination sites (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur atoms).

  These descriptors can be calculated using cheminformatics tools and provide quantitative data for model building.

- **Advice 5**: **Encode Chain Lengths and Flexibility Numerically**

  For rules involving chain lengths and flexibility (e.g., "medium-length hydrocarbon chains"), directly calculate the number of carbons in aliphatic chains and include features such as:

  - Longest aliphatic chain length.
  - Number of rotatable bonds.
  - Flexibility indices.

  This quantification allows for numerical analysis of the impact of chain length and flexibility on yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Represent Electronic Effects with Numeric Values**

  Instead of qualitative descriptions like "electron-withdrawing groups," assign numerical values that represent electronic effects:

  - Use Hammett sigma constants for substituents on aromatic rings.
  - Calculate the sum of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating group parameters.
  - Include descriptors like HOMO-LUMO gap or electronegativity.

- **Advice 7**: **Create Binary Features for Key Functional Groups**

  Generate binary (0 or 1) features indicating the presence or absence of critical functional groups identified in the rules:

  - **HasCarboxylicAcid**: 0 or 1
  - **HasAminoGroup**: 0 or 1
  - **HasThiolGroup**: 0 or 1
  - **HasAromaticRing**: 0 or 1
  - **HasElectronWithdrawingGroup**: 0 or 1
  - **HasElectronDonatingGroup**: 0 or 1
  - **HasMultipleHydroxyls**: 0 or 1

  This approach simplifies the incorporation of functional group information into the feature matrix.

- **Advice 8**: **Automate Feature Extraction Using Cheminformatics Libraries**

  Utilize cheminformatics tools like RDKit to automate the extraction of molecular features from SMILES strings. RDKit can calculate a wide range of descriptors and identify substructures, streamlining the data preparation process.

- **Advice 9**: **Prioritize Features Based on Statistical Analysis**

  Perform statistical analyses (e.g., correlation analysis, feature importance from decision tree models) to determine which features have the strongest association with high yield. Focus on these features in rule refinement and model development.

- **Advice 10**: **Develop a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Model**

  Use the numerical features and descriptors to build a QSAR model that predicts yield based on molecular structure. Machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forest, support vector machines) can be trained on the dataset to uncover complex relationships not apparent from qualitative rules alone.

- **Advice 11**: **Iteratively Refine Rules Based on Model Insights**

  Analyze the QSAR model results to identify misclassified compounds or outliers. Investigate these cases to refine the rules further, possibly uncovering new patterns or exceptions that can improve the model's accuracy.

- **Advice 12**: **Include Solubility and Hydrophobicity Considerations**

  Since modifiers interact with the catalyst surface, their solubility and hydrophobicity may impact yield. Calculate descriptors like:

  - **Water Solubility (LogS)**
  - **Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient (LogP)**
  - **Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance (HLB)**

  Incorporate these into the feature matrix to account for solubility effects.

- **Advice 13**: **Standardize and Normalize Descriptor Values**

  Ensure that all numerical descriptors are on comparable scales by applying standardization or normalization. This processing is essential for algorithms sensitive to the scale of input features.

- **Advice 14**: **Document Feature Definitions Clearly**

  Provide clear documentation for each feature, including how it is calculated and its relevance to the reaction yield. This transparency facilitates reproducibility and aids in future rule adjustments.

- **Advice 15**: **Validate the Refined Rules on External Data**

  Test the improved rules and models on new modifiers not included in the initial dataset to assess their predictive power and generalizability. This validation step is crucial for confirming the practical utility of the rules.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield; α-amino monocarboxylic acids with aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) result in low yield, while those with extended conjugated aromatic systems (e.g., tryptophan) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of two carboxylate groups enhances metal chelation and coordination with the catalyst, improving interaction and increasing yield. In the case of tryptophan, the extended indole ring offers additional π-π interactions with the catalyst. Monocarboxylic acids with simple aromatic side chains lack these enhanced interactions, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing or metal-coordinating groups (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, thiol) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups enhance the ability of the modifier to interact with metal centers by increasing the acidity of the carboxylic acid and facilitating better coordination. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and coordination potential, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination result in high yield; however, if bulky aromatic rings are directly connected, resulting in steric hindrance, the yield is low.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield. However, direct connection of bulky aromatic rings, as in 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, can cause steric hindrance that impedes effective catalyst interaction, resulting in low yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) lacking terminal polar groups result in high yield; introducing terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains promote hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Terminal polar groups introduce polarity and hydrogen bonding, disrupting these interactions and leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the potential for hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol (–SH) groups result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that disrupt effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that hinder proper orientation and binding of the modifier to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups introduce additional nonspecific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential competition with the catalyst binding sites and altered electronic properties.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong interactions through hydrogen bonding or coordination with metal centers, potentially blocking or competing with the catalyst's active sites and altering the acidity of the carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains restrict these interactions due to steric hindrance or insufficient length for optimal alignment.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing rigid, fused aromatic systems that allow for π-π stacking interactions with the catalyst result in high yield due to enhanced binding affinity.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Fused aromatic systems can engage in strong π-π stacking interactions with the catalyst's aromatic components, improving binding and catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxylic acid on aromatic rings (salicylic acid derivatives) result in low yield due to strong chelation that may lead to catalyst deactivation.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The ortho-hydroxyl group can strongly chelate metal centers, potentially leading to catalyst deactivation or blocking active sites, thus reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings without flexible linkers result in low yield due to steric hindrance that impedes catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups directly attached to aromatic rings can prevent effective binding to the catalyst by blocking approach to the active sites, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl groups result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects that decrease the coordinating ability of functional groups.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The trifluoroacetyl group is highly electron-withdrawing, which can reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms (e.g., amino or carboxyl groups), diminishing their ability to interact with the catalyst's metal centers.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield; α-amino monocarboxylic acids with aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) result in low yield, while those with extended conjugated aromatic systems (e.g., tryptophan) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of two carboxylate groups enhances metal chelation and coordination with the catalyst, improving interaction and increasing yield. In the case of tryptophan, the extended indole ring offers additional π-π interactions with the catalyst. Monocarboxylic acids with simple aromatic side chains lack these enhanced interactions, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing or metal-coordinating groups (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, thiol) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups enhance the ability of the modifier to interact with metal centers by increasing the acidity of the carboxylic acid and facilitating better coordination. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and coordination potential, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination result in high yield; however, if bulky aromatic rings are directly connected, resulting in steric hindrance, the yield is low.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield. However, direct connection of bulky aromatic rings, as in 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, can cause steric hindrance that impedes effective catalyst interaction, resulting in low yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) lacking terminal polar groups result in high yield; introducing terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains promote hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Terminal polar groups introduce polarity and hydrogen bonding, disrupting these interactions and leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the potential for hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol (–SH) groups result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that disrupt effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that hinder proper orientation and binding of the modifier to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups introduce additional nonspecific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential competition with the catalyst binding sites and altered electronic properties.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong interactions through hydrogen bonding or coordination with metal centers, potentially blocking or competing with the catalyst's active sites and altering the acidity of the carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains restrict these interactions due to steric hindrance or insufficient length for optimal alignment.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing rigid, fused aromatic systems that allow for π-π stacking interactions with the catalyst result in high yield due to enhanced binding affinity.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Fused aromatic systems can engage in strong π-π stacking interactions with the catalyst's aromatic components, improving binding and catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxylic acid on aromatic rings (salicylic acid derivatives) result in low yield due to strong chelation that may lead to catalyst deactivation.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The ortho-hydroxyl group can strongly chelate metal centers, potentially leading to catalyst deactivation or blocking active sites, thus reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings without flexible linkers result in low yield due to steric hindrance that impedes catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups directly attached to aromatic rings can prevent effective binding to the catalyst by blocking approach to the active sites, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl groups result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects that decrease the coordinating ability of functional groups.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The trifluoroacetyl group is highly electron-withdrawing, which can reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms (e.g., amino or carboxyl groups), diminishing their ability to interact with the catalyst's metal centers.

**End of Rules**

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Modify the SMARTS patterns for Rule 1 to be more general and accommodate variations in hydrogen counts and stereochemistry.**

  - *Issue*: The current SMARTS pattern for high-yield α-amino dicarboxylic acids is too specific and misses common structures like aspartic acid and glutamic acid. It does not account for tautomers, zwitterions, or variations in hydrogen atoms due to ionization states.
  
  - *Current Pattern*:
    ```python
    '[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'  # α-amino dicarboxylic acid
    ```
  
  - *Improvement*: Remove hydrogen count specifications and allow for possible ionization states. Use wildcards for hydrogen atoms and charges.
  
  - *Suggested Pattern*:
    ```python
    '[N][C]([C](=O)[O])[C](=O)[O]'  # More general α-amino dicarboxylic acid
    ```
  
  - *Explanation*: This pattern matches any nitrogen attached to a carbon, which is connected to two carboxyl groups, regardless of hydrogen counts or charges, thus capturing aspartic acid and glutamic acid in various forms.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for the tryptophan-like structures in Rule 1 to ensure correct matching.**

  - *Issue*: The current pattern may be too restrictive due to specific hydrogen and stereochemistry requirements.
  
  - *Current Pattern*:
    ```python
    '[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX3H][c]1c[nH]c2ccccc12'  # Tryptophan-like structure
    ```
  
  - *Improvement*: Generalize the pattern by removing specific hydrogen counts and allowing for variations in the indole ring.
  
  - *Suggested Pattern*:
    ```python
    '[N][C]([C](=O)[O])[C][c]1c[nH]c2ccccc12'  # Generalized tryptophan structure
    ```
  
  - *Explanation*: This pattern focuses on the essential connectivity of tryptophan without over-specifying hydrogens, making it more likely to match the SMILES representation of tryptophan.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Expand the SMARTS pattern for phenylalanine-like structures in Rule 1 to capture variations in SMILES representations.**

  - *Issue*: The current low-yield pattern may not match phenylalanine due to strict hydrogen counts.
  
  - *Current Pattern*:
    ```python
    '[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX3H][c]1ccccc1'  # Phenylalanine-like structure
    ```
  
  - *Improvement*: Remove hydrogen count constraints and allow for different representations of the benzyl side chain.
  
  - *Suggested Pattern*:
    ```python
    '[N][C]([C](=O)[O])[C][c]1ccccc1'  # Generalized phenylalanine structure
    ```
  
  - *Explanation*: This pattern captures any α-amino acid with a benzyl side chain, aligning with the definition of phenylalanine.

- **Suggestion 4**: **For Rule 2, modify the SMARTS patterns to account for ionization states and substituent variations on the benzoic acid ring.**

  - *Issue*: Current patterns may miss compounds due to the specific positioning of substituents and lack of charge flexibility.
  
  - *Current Patterns*:
    ```python
    'O=C(O)c1ccc([NH2])cc1'  # 4-aminobenzoic acid
    ```
  
  - *Improvement*: Use wildcard atoms and allow for various substituents with electron-withdrawing or donating properties.
  
  - *Suggested Patterns*:
    ```python
    # High yield (electron-withdrawing groups)
    'O=C([O-])c1ccc([NX3,NX4+,C=O,F,Cl,Br,I])cc1'  # Para-substituted benzoic acids with EWG
    
    # Low yield (electron-donating groups)
    'O=C([O-])c1ccc([CH3,SH,OH])cc1'  # Para-substituted benzoic acids with EDG
    ```
  
  - *Explanation*: These patterns are more inclusive and consider both ionized carboxylate forms and a variety of substituents, improving match accuracy.

- **Suggestion 5**: **For Rule 3, broaden the SMARTS patterns to match heteroaromatic carboxylic acids more effectively.**

  - *Issue*: The current patterns may not capture all heteroaromatic carboxylic acids due to rigid structures.
  
  - *Current Patterns*:
    ```python
    'O=C(O)c1cccnc1'  # Nicotinic acid
    ```
  
  - *Improvement*: Introduce a generic pattern for heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination.
  
  - *Suggested Pattern*:
    ```python
    'O=C([O-])[cH1][c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n]'  # General heteroaromatic carboxylic acid with nitrogen
    ```
  
  - *Explanation*: This pattern allows for any six-membered heteroaromatic ring with nitrogen atoms, increasing the likelihood of matching relevant compounds.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Ensure that the code handles different ionization states by standardizing molecules before substructure searches.**

  - *Issue*: Carboxylic acids may exist in protonated or deprotonated forms, affecting pattern matching.
  
  - *Improvement*: Add a preprocessing step in the code to standardize ionization states using RDKit's `Chem.MolToSmiles` with canonicalization or explicitly include both protonated and deprotonated forms in SMARTS patterns.
  
  - *Explanation*: By accounting for different ionization states, the code will more consistently match the intended structures regardless of their protonation.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Validate and test the SMARTS patterns with a diverse set of example molecules to ensure accurate matching.**

  - *Issue*: Without thorough testing, patterns may not perform as expected across different molecules.
  
  - *Improvement*: Create a test suite with known positive and negative examples for each rule and verify that the patterns match only the appropriate molecules.
  
  - *Explanation*: Testing will help identify and correct any flaws in the patterns before applying them to the full dataset.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

In reviewing the current rules and their associated metrics, we observe several key points when comparing them to the previous rule metrics. Our focus will be on the **confidence** and **lift** values, as these are crucial indicators of rule performance in predictive modeling.

---

**1. Comparison with Previous Metrics**

- **Support**:
  - *Previous Rules*: The train support ranged from approximately **16.67%** to **18.45%**.
  - *Current Rules*: The train support values are **10.23%**, **1.67%**, and **4.76%** for the three sets of rules provided.
  - *Observation*: There is a noticeable decrease in support in the current rules compared to the previous ones. The support values are lower, indicating that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the training data.

- **Confidence**:
  - *Previous Rules*: The train confidence ranged from **53.96%** to **63.52%**.
  - *Current Rules*: The train confidence values have increased to **64.62%**, **68.06%**, and **75%**.
  - *Observation*: There is an improvement in confidence levels in the current rules, suggesting that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of correctly predicting the outcome has increased.

- **Lift**:
  - *Previous Rules*: The train lift values were **1.0559** and **1.2048**.
  - *Current Rules*: The train lift values have increased to **1.2845**, **1.3681**, and **1.4962**.
  - *Observation*: The lift has significantly increased in the current rules, indicating that the rules are more effective at predicting the outcome compared to random chance. A lift value greater than 1 suggests a positive association between the rule conditions and the prediction.

- **Leverage**:
  - *Previous Rules*: The train leverage values were **0.0289** and **-0.0041**.
  - *Current Rules*: The train leverage values are **0.0095**, **0.0071**, and **0.0188**.
  - *Observation*: The leverage remains positive in the current rules, though the values are relatively small. This indicates that the rules provide some additional predictive power over chance, but the impact is modest.

---

**2. Implications of Metrics Changes**

- **Decreased Support**:
  - The lower support in the current rules suggests that they cover fewer instances in the dataset. While this can be acceptable if the rules are highly accurate, it may also indicate that the rules are becoming too specific or are overfitting to the training data.
  
- **Increased Confidence and Lift**:
  - Higher confidence values mean that when the rule conditions are satisfied, the prediction is more reliable. The increased lift values reinforce that the rules are useful in making predictions beyond what would be expected by chance.
  - This improvement points towards better quality rules in terms of predictive accuracy for the instances they cover.

- **Leverage Interpretation**:
  - Positive leverage values indicate that the rules are capturing associations not expected by chance. However, the relatively low leverage values suggest that the overall impact on the dataset is limited due to the low support.

---

**3. Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum Consideration**:
  - The improvements in confidence and lift, coupled with decreased support, might suggest that the optimization process is honing in on specific subsets of data where the rules perform well, potentially at the cost of generality.
  - If further iterations continue to decrease support while only marginally increasing confidence and lift, it may indicate that a local minimum has been reached in terms of rule optimization.

- **Sufficiency of Iterations**:
  - Given the current trend, it appears that the rules are becoming more precise but less general. This raises the question of whether additional iterations will yield significant improvements.
  - It may be beneficial to consider stopping further iterations to prevent overfitting, or to adjust the strategy to balance support with confidence and lift.

---

**4. Recommendations for Improvement**

- **Balance Between Support and Confidence**:
  - **Expand Rule Coverage**: Re-evaluate the rules to see if they can be slightly generalized to cover a larger portion of the dataset without compromising confidence significantly.
    - For example, identify common structural features among high-yield modifiers that are not overly specific.
  - **Combine Similar Rules**: Look for opportunities to merge rules that have similar conditions or predictions to improve support while maintaining high confidence.
  
- **Prevent Overfitting**:
  - **Avoid Over-Specific Conditions**: Ensure that the rules are not overly tailored to specific data points. Introduce some flexibility in the rule conditions to enhance applicability.
  - **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques to test the rules on different subsets of data, ensuring that they generalize well and are not just fitting the training data.

- **Leverage Domain Knowledge**:
  - **Chemical Insight**: Use chemical reasoning to adjust rules, focusing on functional groups and structural motifs known to influence catalytic activity.
    - For instance, re-examine rules with very low support but high confidence to see if they can be expanded based on chemical similarity.
  
- **Enhance Rule Evaluation**:
  - **Include Test Metrics**: Incorporate test set metrics to assess how well the rules perform on unseen data.
    - A high train confidence and lift but low test performance could indicate overfitting.
  - **Monitor Leverage Trends**: Keep an eye on leverage values to ensure that rules add meaningful predictive power and are not coincidental.

---

**5. Specific Suggestions on Current Rules**

- **Review Low Support Rules**:
  - Rules with extremely low support (e.g., **1.67%**) may need to be generalized.
    - *Example*: Rule 2 could be broadened by including modifiers with similar electronic properties but slightly different substituents.
  
- **Adjust Overly Specific Conditions**:
  - For rules like **Rule 14**, which focuses on bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings, consider if this can be expanded to include modifiers with similar steric effects but varying ring systems.

- **Simplify Complex Rules**:
  - Rules that combine multiple conditions may be too restrictive.
    - *Action*: Break down complex rules into simpler components to identify which conditions are most critical for high yield.

- **Incorporate Negative Examples**:
  - Analyze modifiers that do not fit the current rules but result in high yield to identify potential exceptions or additional patterns.
    - This could lead to discovering new rules or refining existing ones.

---

**6. Conclusion**

The current rules show improved confidence and lift, indicating enhanced predictive capability for the instances they cover. However, the decrease in support suggests that they apply to a smaller subset of data, potentially limiting their overall utility. To improve the rules:

- Aim for a better balance between support and confidence.
- Avoid overfitting by ensuring rules are not overly specific.
- Use chemical insights to generalize rules where possible.
- Evaluate rules using both training and testing data to ensure generalizability.

By implementing these suggestions, we can develop a set of rules that not only predict high-yield modifiers more accurately but also apply to a broader range of compounds, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of the catalytic research program.

ML Commenter Message:
**Comments on Accuracies of Validation and Training Sets:**

Based on the provided data, the performance of the classification model has decreased in the latest iterations compared to previous ones. Initially, the validation accuracies were consistently high:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies:** `[0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]` with test accuracies ranging from **0.625** to **0.75**.

In contrast, the accuracies during the current iteration are lower:

- **Current Validation Accuracy:** **0.5143** (approximately **51.43%**).

This decline suggests that the current rules used to generate the feature matrix may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data as effectively as before. The model's predictive ability on the validation set has diminished, indicating potential issues with the model's generalization performance.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions. In the latest iteration, the SHAP values indicate that only **Rule 3** is significantly influencing the predictions:

- For multiple molecules, **Rule 3** has either a small positive, small negative, or zero SHAP value.
- The other rules do not appear to be contributing meaningfully to the model's predictions in this iteration.

**Examples from SHAP Analysis:**

1. **Underestimation Cases (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - **Molecules:** 
     - `C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`
     - `C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O`
     - `C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O`
     - `C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)O`
   - **Observation:** Predicted loading is low, but experimental value is high.
   - **SHAP Values:** **Rule 3** has a small positive SHAP value (~0.0172), suggesting it contributes slightly towards predicting a high loading, but not enough to correct the incorrect low prediction.

2. **Overestimation Cases (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **In this iteration, there are no cases where the predicted loading is high while the experimental value is low.**

3. **Consistent Predictions (Predicted Low, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecules:** 
     - `C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F`
     - `C(CCCN)CCC(=O)O`
     - Other molecules with predicted and experimental values both low.
   - **Observation:** The model correctly predicts low loading.
   - **SHAP Values:** **Rule 3** has a small negative or zero SHAP value.

**Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- The dominance of **Rule 3** in the SHAP values suggests that the model heavily relies on this rule while other rules have minimal or no contribution.
- The small magnitude of the SHAP values indicates that **Rule 3** alone is insufficient to make accurate predictions, especially for molecules where the experimental loading is high but predicted as low.
- The lack of contribution from other rules suggests potential issues with the feature matrix or the rules themselves, possibly due to over-simplification or inappropriate weighting.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

- **Underfitting:** The significant drop in validation accuracy implies that the model may be underfitting. It is not capturing the complexity of the data adequately.
- **Over-reliance on Rule 3:** The model's dependence on a single rule indicates that it lacks the necessary complexity to generalize well to the validation set.
- **Possible Cause:** Recent modifications to the rules may have inadvertently diminished the contributions of other important rules, leading to a less effective model.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

- The decrease in validation accuracy from **76%** to **51%** suggests that the recent changes to the rules have not improved the model but have instead reduced its predictive performance.
- The model may have reached a local minimum where further adjustments without significant changes to the rules will not yield improvements.
- The lack of enhancement in accuracy over multiple iterations indicates that additional iterations with the current approach may not be beneficial.

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis for Rule Improvement:**

- **Underestimated Loadings:** For molecules where the model predicts low loading but the experimental value is high, Rule 3 has a small positive SHAP value, but not enough to influence the prediction correctly. This suggests that **Rule 3** may need to be refined to increase its impact for such cases.
- **Other Rules' Lack of Contribution:** The absence of significant SHAP values for other rules indicates that they may not be effectively capturing relevant features or have been improperly modified.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Rule 3:**

   - **Adjustment Needed:** Enhance the specificity of **Rule 3** to better distinguish between molecules that result in high and low loadings.
   - **Action Items:**
     - Reevaluate the conditions within Rule 3 to ensure they are neither too broad nor too narrow.
     - Consider incorporating sub-rules or additional criteria that capture nuances in heteroaromatic carboxylic acids.

2. **Reassess and Reinstate Other Rules:**

   - **Issue Identified:** The model's over-reliance on a single rule suggests that other rules are not contributing.
   - **Action Items:**
     - Review the previous versions of the rules to identify any that were inadvertently excluded or overly simplified in recent iterations.
     - Reintroduce rules that previously had positive contributions, ensuring they are correctly defined and implemented in the feature matrix.

3. **Balance Rule Contributions:**

   - **Goal:** Ensure a balanced contribution from multiple rules to improve model robustness.
   - **Action Items:**
     - Adjust the weighting or scaling of features derived from different rules to prevent any single rule from dominating the model.
     - Use statistical techniques to standardize or normalize feature values.

4. **Address Underfitting:**

   - **Issue Identified:** The model may be too simplistic, failing to capture complex patterns.
   - **Action Items:**
     - Increase the complexity of the model by considering interactions between rules or higher-order features.
     - Evaluate the model with additional relevant descriptors or features that capture important chemical properties not currently included.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data Analysis:**

   - **Goal:** Gain deeper insights into misclassifications.
   - **Action Items:**
     - Perform a detailed analysis of mispredicted molecules to identify common structural features not accounted for by current rules.
     - Use clustering or dimensionality reduction techniques to visualize data and uncover hidden patterns.

6. **Iterative Rule Refinement:**

   - **Approach:** Use an iterative process to refine rules based on SHAP insights.
   - **Action Items:**
     - After adjusting rules, re-evaluate the model and SHAP values to assess the impact of changes.
     - Continue refining rules that consistently contribute to mispredictions, either by modification or, if necessary, removal.

7. **Prevent Overfitting to a Single Rule:**

   - **Issue Identified:** Over-reliance on Rule 3 indicates a risk of overfitting to features associated with this rule.
   - **Action Items:**
     - Implement regularization techniques in the model to penalize excessive reliance on any single feature.
     - Ensure that the model's hyperparameters are set to promote generalization.

8. **Enhance Rule Diversity and Coverage:**

   - **Goal:** Capture a broader range of chemical features affecting catalyst loading.
   - **Action Items:**
     - Introduce new rules that address structural motifs or properties not currently considered, based on chemical intuition and literature.
     - Validate new rules with domain experts to ensure their relevance.

**Conclusion:**

The current model's decreased performance indicates that the existing rules are not adequately capturing the factors influencing catalyst loading. By refining Rule 3, reassessing other rules, and ensuring a balanced contribution from multiple rules, the model's predictive ability can be improved. Iterative refinement informed by SHAP analysis will help adjust the rules to better align with experimental observations, ultimately enhancing the model's accuracy and generalization.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization**

Recent analyses of the current rules and their performance metrics have highlighted several key areas for improvement to enhance the predictive accuracy and generalizability of our catalytic yield model.

**1. Issues with Current SMARTS Patterns and Rules**

- **Overly Specific Patterns**: The existing SMARTS patterns are too restrictive due to specific hydrogen counts, stereochemistry, and charge requirements. This over-specification leads to missed matches for important compounds and a decrease in rule support.
  
- **Underrepresentation of Key Molecules**: Essential modifiers like aspartic acid and glutamic acid are not being matched by the current patterns, excluding them from the model's predictive capability.

- **Ionization State Variations**: The patterns do not account for different ionization states, tautomers, or zwitterionic forms, further limiting their applicability.

- **Overreliance on a Single Rule**: SHAP analysis indicates that the model heavily depends on **Rule 3** for predictions, while other rules contribute minimally. This imbalance reduces the model's robustness.

**2. Decreased Model Performance**

- **Validation Accuracy Decline**: The validation accuracy has decreased from approximately **76%** in earlier iterations to around **51%**, indicating reduced predictive power.

- **Underfitting**: The model is not capturing the complexity of the data, suggesting that it is too simplistic and failing to generalize well.

- **Low Rule Support**: The rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset due to their specificity, as evidenced by decreased train support values.

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**

To address these issues and enhance the model's performance, the following directions are recommended:

**A. Generalize SMARTS Patterns**

- **Remove Over-Specific Constraints**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to eliminate strict hydrogen count specifications, explicit charges, and stereochemistry requirements. This generalization increases pattern flexibility and matching accuracy.

  - *Example for Rule 1 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids)*:
    - **Current Pattern**: `'[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`
    - **Improved Pattern**: `'[N][C]([C](=O)[O])[C](=O)[O]'`
    - *Benefit*: Captures various ionization states and tautomers of aspartic acid and glutamic acid.

- **Include Variations in Ring Structures**: For aromatic modifiers, allow for different positions of substituents and variations in ring systems.

  - *Example for Tryptophan-Like Structures*:
    - **Current Pattern**: `'[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX3H][c]1c[nH]c2ccccc12'`
    - **Improved Pattern**: `'[N][C]([C](=O)[O])[C][c]1c[nH]c2ccccc12'`

**B. Adjust Patterns for Substituents and Ionization States**

- **Account for Electron-Withdrawing and Donating Groups**: Modify patterns in **Rule 2** to include a broader range of substituents by using wildcards and focusing on functional group properties rather than specific atoms.

  - *High Yield (Electron-Withdrawing Groups)*:
    - **Pattern**: `'O=C([O-])c1ccc([NX3,NX4+,C=O,F,Cl,Br,I])cc1'`
  
  - *Low Yield (Electron-Donating Groups)*:
    - **Pattern**: `'O=C([O-])c1ccc([CH3,SH,OH])cc1'`

- **Handle Ionization States**: Ensure that patterns match both protonated and deprotonated forms by using `[O-]` and `[OH]` interchangeably where appropriate.

**C. Expand Rule Coverage and Balance Contributions**

- **Broaden Scope of Rules**: For **Rule 3** and others, create more inclusive patterns that capture a variety of heteroaromatic carboxylic acids and prevent underrepresentation.

  - *Example*:
    - **Pattern**: `'O=C([O-])c1ncccc1'`  (General heteroaromatic ring with nitrogen)

- **Reassess and Reinstate Other Rules**: Reevaluate previously effective rules that may have been overly simplified or excluded, ensuring they contribute to the model's predictions.

**D. Enhance Model Complexity and Prevent Underfitting**

- **Introduce Additional Features**: Incorporate new descriptors or interactions between rules to capture complex patterns in the data.

- **Use Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques to assess model performance and prevent underfitting.

**E. Validate and Test SMARTS Patterns**

- **Develop a Test Suite**: Create a diverse set of molecules, including positive and negative examples, to test each rule's pattern for accuracy and specificity.

- **Iteratively Refine Patterns**: Based on testing outcomes, adjust patterns to improve their matching accuracy.

**F. Leverage Domain Knowledge**

- **Incorporate Chemical Insights**: Use knowledge of chemical properties and mechanisms to guide rule modifications, ensuring they reflect the underlying chemistry affecting yield.

**G. Balance Feature Contributions**

- **Adjust Weightings**: In the modeling process, scale features appropriately to prevent dominance by any single rule and enhance overall predictive performance.

**Judgment on Possibility for Further Optimization**

There is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Improving Generalization**: By generalizing SMARTS patterns and expanding rule coverage, we can increase the rules' support and applicability across the dataset.

- **Enhancing Model Accuracy**: Addressing underfitting and ensuring balanced contributions from multiple rules should improve validation accuracy and predictive power.

- **Preventing Overfitting**: By carefully adjusting patterns and using cross-validation, we can optimize the rules to better capture the data's complexity without tailoring them too closely to the training set.

**Conclusion**

Given the identified issues and the potential for improvement, it is advisable to further optimize the current rules to enhance the model's performance and generalizability.

**Please Optimize Rules**

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield; α-amino monocarboxylic acids with aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) result in low yield, while those with extended conjugated aromatic systems (e.g., tryptophan) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of two carboxylate groups enhances metal chelation and coordination with the catalyst, improving interaction and increasing yield. In the case of tryptophan, the extended indole ring offers additional π-π interactions with the catalyst. Monocarboxylic acids with simple aromatic side chains lack these enhanced interactions, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing or metal-coordinating groups (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, thiol) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups enhance the ability of the modifier to interact with metal centers by increasing the acidity of the carboxylic acid and facilitating better coordination. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and coordination potential, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination result in high yield; however, if bulky aromatic rings are directly connected, resulting in steric hindrance, the yield is low.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield. However, direct connection of bulky aromatic rings, as in 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, can cause steric hindrance that impedes effective catalyst interaction, resulting in low yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) lacking terminal polar groups result in high yield; introducing terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains promote hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Terminal polar groups introduce polarity and hydrogen bonding, disrupting these interactions and leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the potential for hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol (–SH) groups result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that disrupt effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that hinder proper orientation and binding of the modifier to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups introduce additional nonspecific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential competition with the catalyst binding sites and altered electronic properties.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong interactions through hydrogen bonding or coordination with metal centers, potentially blocking or competing with the catalyst's active sites and altering the acidity of the carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains restrict these interactions due to steric hindrance or insufficient length for optimal alignment.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing rigid, fused aromatic systems that allow for π-π stacking interactions with the catalyst result in high yield due to enhanced binding affinity.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Fused aromatic systems can engage in strong π-π stacking interactions with the catalyst's aromatic components, improving binding and catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxylic acid on aromatic rings (salicylic acid derivatives) result in low yield due to strong chelation that may lead to catalyst deactivation.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The ortho-hydroxyl group can strongly chelate metal centers, potentially leading to catalyst deactivation or blocking active sites, thus reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings without flexible linkers result in low yield due to steric hindrance that impedes catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups directly attached to aromatic rings can prevent effective binding to the catalyst by blocking approach to the active sites, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl groups result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects that decrease the coordinating ability of functional groups.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The trifluoroacetyl group is highly electron-withdrawing, which can reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms (e.g., amino or carboxyl groups), diminishing their ability to interact with the catalyst's metal centers.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been formulated by analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties of the modifiers. They combine multiple substructures and functional groups to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield in the reaction. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity to provide effective guidance for future modifier design.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of two carboxylate groups enhances metal chelation and coordination with the catalyst, improving interaction and increasing yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with extended conjugated side chains (e.g., tryptophan) result in high yield; those with non-conjugated aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: Extended conjugated systems like the indole ring in tryptophan can engage in π-π stacking with the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic activity. Non-conjugated aromatic side chains lack this interaction, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, amino, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, thiol) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance metal coordination with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination potential, leading to reduced catalytic interaction and lower yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in high yield due to enhanced metal coordination.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for metal ions, improving interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no terminal polar groups result in high yield; introducing terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains promote hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Terminal polar groups introduce polarity and can disrupt these interactions, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase opportunities for hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with aromatic aldehyde or ketone groups (e.g., formyl groups) directly attached to the ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with fused aromatic systems adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in high yield due to potential π-π stacking interactions with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Fused aromatic rings can engage in strong π-π stacking interactions with the catalyst's aromatic components, enhancing binding and catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains may not allow optimal alignment, reducing yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential competition with the catalyst binding sites and altered electronic properties.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong interactions through hydrogen bonding or coordination with metal centers, potentially blocking or competing with the catalyst's active sites and altering the acidity of the carboxylic acid.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of two carboxylate groups enhances metal chelation and coordination with the catalyst, improving interaction and increasing yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with extended conjugated side chains (e.g., tryptophan) result in high yield; those with non-conjugated aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: Extended conjugated systems like the indole ring in tryptophan can engage in π-π stacking with the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic activity. Non-conjugated aromatic side chains lack this interaction, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, amino, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, thiol) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance metal coordination with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination potential, leading to reduced catalytic interaction and lower yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in high yield due to enhanced metal coordination.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for metal ions, improving interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no terminal polar groups result in high yield; introducing terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains promote hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Terminal polar groups introduce polarity and can disrupt these interactions, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase opportunities for hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with aromatic aldehyde or ketone groups (e.g., formyl groups) directly attached to the ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with fused aromatic systems adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in high yield due to potential π-π stacking interactions with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Fused aromatic rings can engage in strong π-π stacking interactions with the catalyst's aromatic components, enhancing binding and catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains may not allow optimal alignment, reducing yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid function result in low yield due to potential competition with the catalyst binding sites and altered electronic properties.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups near the carboxylic acid can form strong interactions through hydrogen bonding or coordination with metal centers, potentially blocking or competing with the catalyst's active sites and altering the acidity of the carboxylic acid.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Improve Rule 3 Patterns**  
  The SMARTS patterns for 'electron_withdrawing_aromatic' and 'electron_donating_aromatic' in Rule 3 do not accurately capture the substituents described in the natural language rules. Specifically:
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWG)**: The pattern `[c][F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-]` only matches nitro groups on aromatic carbons but misses other EWGs like amino and bromomethyl groups. Update the EWG pattern to include these groups:
    - New EWG Pattern: `c1ccc(cc1)[$(N),$(N[H]),$(N([H])[H]),$(N(=O)=O),$(BrC)]`
    - This pattern matches para-substituted benzene rings with amino (`-NH2`), nitro (`-NO2`), and bromomethyl (`-CH2Br`) groups.
  - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDG)**: The pattern `[c][OX2H,OX2][CH3]` does not capture methyl and thiol groups accurately. Update the EDG pattern to include methyl and thiol substituents:
    - New EDG Pattern: `c1ccc(cc1)[$(C),$(S[H])]`
    - This pattern matches para-substituted benzene rings with methyl (`-CH3`) and thiol (`-SH`) groups.
  - **Para-Substitution**: Ensure that the substituents are specifically at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group. Modify the SMARTS to enforce para-substitution:
    - For EWG: `c1cc([$(N),$(N[H]),$(N([H])[H]),$(N(=O)=O),$(BrC)])ccc1C(=O)O`
    - For EDG: `c1cc([$(C),$(S[H])])ccc1C(=O)O`
  - **Implementation**: Update the `compiled_patterns` dictionary and adjust the Rule 3 conditions to use these new patterns.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Exclude Carboxylic Acid from Terminal Polar Groups in Rule 5**  
  In Rule 5, the 'terminal_polar_group' pattern `[NX3H2,NX3H1,NX3H0,OX2H]` incorrectly matches the hydroxyl oxygen in the carboxylic acid group, causing molecules like octanoic acid to be misclassified. To fix this:
  - **Modify Terminal Polar Group Pattern**: Exclude oxygens that are part of a carboxylic acid by using a negative lookahead or excluding oxygens double-bonded to carbonyl carbons.
    - New Terminal Polar Group Pattern: `[$(N[#1,#6]),$(O[H]);!$(O=C[O,N])]`
    - This pattern matches amino and hydroxyl groups not adjacent to carbonyls.
  - **Implementation**: Update the `terminal_polar_group` in `compiled_patterns` with the new SMARTS pattern.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Refine Long Aliphatic Chain Pattern in Rule 5**  
  The current 'long_aliphatic_chain' pattern `[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]` may not accurately capture medium-length hydrocarbon chains of 6–8 carbons. To improve this:
  - **Use Variable Length Chains**: Utilize SMARTS with repetitions to match chains of specific lengths.
    - New Long Aliphatic Chain Pattern: `C(CCCCC)C` or `C(-C){5,7}C`
    - Alternatively, use recursive SMARTS or adjust the pattern to match chains with 6–8 carbons.
  - **Implementation**: Update `long_aliphatic_chain` in `compiled_patterns` with a pattern that accurately reflects the chain length specified in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Include Additional Heteroaromatic Rings in Rule 4**  
  Rule 4 mentions heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms like pyrazole, but the code only includes pyridine. To address this:
  - **Add Pyrazole Pattern**: Include a SMARTS pattern for pyrazole rings.
    - Pyrazole Pattern: `c1cnn[cH]1`
  - **Expand Rule Conditions**: Modify Rule 4 to check for the presence of any nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring.
    - Use a combined pattern or check for multiple heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen.
  - **Implementation**: Add the new pattern to `compiled_patterns` and update Rule 4's conditions to include these patterns.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Implement Remaining Rules (6 to 13)**  
  The current code only implements Rules 1 to 5, leaving out Rules 6 to 13. To complete the transformation:
  - **Define Patterns for Remaining Rules**: For each rule, identify the key functional groups and substructures, and create corresponding SMARTS patterns.
    - For example, Rule 6 (Flexible ether chains with terminal polar groups leading to low yield) would require patterns for ether linkages and terminal polar groups.
  - **Add New Rules to the Code**: Extend the `rules` list to include Rules 6 to 13, specifying their conditions, patterns, and predictions.
  - **Ensure Consistency**: Verify that all patterns accurately represent the natural language rules and that they do not conflict with existing patterns.
  - **Implementation**: Update the code accordingly and test each new rule for correctness.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Validate and Test the Updated Code**  
  After making the above changes:
  - **Validation**: Run the updated code on the SMILES dataset to generate a new feature matrix.
  - **Check Consistency**: Ensure that the predictions in the feature matrix now accurately reflect the rules for each molecule.
  - **Debug**: Address any discrepancies that arise during testing to refine the patterns and conditions further.
  
** End of Suggestions **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the rules to focus on quantifiable molecular descriptors directly obtainable from SMILES strings.** Rewrite the rules by identifying key structural features such as counts of specific functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amino groups, hydroxyl groups), ring systems (aromatic, heteroaromatic), chain lengths, and the presence of conjugated systems. This simplification will make it easier to convert the rules into numerical features for modeling.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize cheminformatics tools to calculate molecular descriptors and integrate them into the rules.** Employ software libraries like RDKit to compute descriptors such as molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and refractivity. Incorporating these quantitative descriptors will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: **Rephrase qualitative statements in the rules into quantitative thresholds.** For example, change "medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons)" to "aliphatic chains with a carbon count between 6 and 8." Specify exact numerical ranges for properties like chain length, electronic effects (using Hammett sigma constants), and hydrophobicity (using LogP values).

- **Advice 4**: **Convert functional group presence into numerical counts or binary features.** Instead of stating "modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups," quantify the exact number of hydroxyl groups and their positions. Create features like "number of hydroxyl groups adjacent to each other" to represent this aspect numerically.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate electronic properties using quantifiable parameters.** Use calculated values such as Hammett sigma constants to represent electron-donating or electron-withdrawing effects of substituents. For example, assign numerical values to substituents based on their electronic influence, which can be summed or used individually in the rules.

- **Advice 6**: **Establish a standardized set of numerical features for all modifiers.** Create a comprehensive feature set that includes counts of functional groups, molecular properties, and structural descriptors. Ensure that each modifier is evaluated against this standardized set to maintain consistency and facilitate numerical analysis.

- **Advice 7**: **Develop a scoring system based on weighted molecular descriptors.** Assign weights to different descriptors based on their influence on the yield (e.g., electron-withdrawing capacity, number of coordination sites). Calculate a composite score for each modifier to predict its effect on the yield quantitatively.

- **Advice 8**: **Simplify complex structural criteria into measurable substructures.** For rules involving specific structural motifs like fused aromatic systems, define them in terms of identifiable substructures that can be detected in SMILES strings (e.g., presence of naphthalene rings, indole moieties).

- **Advice 9**: **Avoid ambiguous terms and ensure each rule corresponds to distinct, measurable features.** Terms like "extended conjugated side chains" can be clarified by specifying the minimum number of conjugated bonds or the presence of particular chromophores. This precision allows for unambiguous feature extraction.

- **Advice 10**: **Integrate 3D structural information if necessary, using computational chemistry methods.** For interactions like π-π stacking or hydrogen bonding, consider calculating molecular conformations and interaction potentials. Use tools like molecular docking to generate numerical values representing these interactions.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, amino, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, sulfanyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for metal ions, improving interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield. However, when the heteroaromatic ring is linked through a rigid aryl group (as in 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), the steric hindrance may reduce effective coordination, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no terminal polar groups result in high yield; introducing terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) leads to low yield.**

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward identification of modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids, resulting in high yield. The physicochemical insight is solid, explaining how the two carboxylate groups enhance metal chelation and coordination with the catalyst. The rule combines multiple functional groups (α-amino and dicarboxylic acid), adding complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (aspartic acid and glutamic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**:

  Rule 2 provides a clear distinction between para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (high yield) and electron-donating groups (low yield). The property insight is strong, relating the acidity and coordination potential of the carboxylic acid to the electronic nature of the substituents. The rule considers both the structural framework and electronic properties, adding complexity. It has good coverage with multiple examples supporting both outcomes.

- **Comment 3**:

  Rule 3 effectively identifies modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring, resulting in high yield. The clarity is acceptable, though it requires recognizing heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms. The physicochemical rationale is sound, explaining enhanced metal coordination through additional nitrogen coordination sites. The rule has moderate complexity and is supported by several examples, though coverage could be improved with more data points.

- **Comment 4**:

  Rule 4 clearly states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no terminal polar groups result in high yield, while introducing terminal polar groups leads to low yield. The property insight is strong, discussing hydrophobic interactions and the disruptive effect of polar groups on catalyst binding. The rule combines chain length and functional group presence, adding complexity. It has good coverage with multiple supporting data points.

- **Comment 5**:

  Rule 5 specifies that modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield. While the rule is clear, it is quite specific. The physicochemical insight is good, explaining enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation. However, the rule has limited complexity and low coverage, with only one supporting data point (gluconic acid), which may limit its general applicability.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 describes modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups resulting in low yield. Clarity is moderate, as it requires identifying specific structural features.

The rule has moderate complexity but limited coverage, supported by only two data points.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 clearly identifies that modifiers with aromatic aldehyde or ketone groups directly attached to the ring result in low yield. The physicochemical rationale is strong, explaining potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions. The rule focuses on specific functional groups, adding complexity. Coverage is acceptable with two supporting low-yield examples.

- **Comment 8**:

  Rule 8 indicates that modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield. The rule is clear and the property insight is reasonable, discussing electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity. However, it lacks complexity and has low coverage, supported by only one data point, which may limit its predictive power.

- **Comment 9**:

  Rule 9 differentiates between aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids (high yield) and aromatic thiol-containing ones (low yield). Clarity is acceptable, requiring recognition of thiol groups and their context. The physicochemical insight is good, explaining how aliphatic thiols interact beneficially while aromatic thiols may poison the catalyst. The rule has moderate complexity but limited coverage, with one example for each outcome.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 states that modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield, while shorter chains result in low yield. Clarity is acceptable, though it involves counting carbon atoms in the chain. The property insight is solid, explaining how chain length affects flexibility and binding interactions. The rule combines chain length with structural features, adding complexity. Coverage is acceptable with multiple supporting examples.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the Rules to Focus on Computable Molecular Features**

  The current rules rely on complex chemical terminology and concepts that are challenging to extract directly from SMILES strings. Simplify the rules by focusing on molecular features that can be readily identified and quantified from SMILES, such as the presence of specific functional groups, atom counts, and substructures.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Functional Group Counts and Specific Substructures**

  Identify key functional groups associated with high or low yield, such as:

  - Presence of **amino groups** (`-NH2`)
  - Number of **carboxylic acid groups** (`-COOH`)
  - Inclusion of **aromatic rings**, especially **nitrogen-containing heterocycles** (e.g., pyridine rings)
  - Count of **hydroxyl groups** (`-OH`)
  - Presence of **sulfur-containing groups** (`-SH`, thiols)

  Create rules based on the counts and presence of these groups, which can be directly parsed from SMILES.

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify Chain Lengths and Linker Flexibility**

  For rules involving aliphatic chains, specify exact chain lengths that can be calculated from the SMILES:

  - High yield if aliphatic chain length is **between 6 and 8 carbons**
  - Low yield if chain length is **less than 4 carbons** or **greater than 8 carbons**

  Similarly, define linker flexibility in terms of the number of rotatable bonds.

- **Advice 4**: **Replace Qualitative Electronic Effects with Specific Substituents**

  Instead of using terms like "electron-withdrawing" or "electron-donating," list specific substituents:

  - High yield associated with modifiers containing **nitro (`-NO2`), cyano (`-CN`), halogens (F, Cl, Br, I)**.
  - Low yield associated with modifiers containing **methoxy (`-OCH3`), methyl (`-CH3`), or alkylthio (`-SR`) groups**.

  This allows for direct identification from SMILES without inferring electronic effects.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Computable Molecular Descriptors**

  Use descriptors that can be calculated from SMILES:

  - **LogP (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient)**: Indicates hydrophobicity.
  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**: Reflects the molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds.
  - **Molecular Weight**: Larger molecules might interact differently with the catalyst.
  - **Hydrogen Bond Donor/Acceptor Counts**: Important for interactions with the catalyst.

  Adjust rules to include threshold values for these descriptors that correlate with high or low yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Use Molecular Fingerprints for Machine Learning Models**

  Suggest employing molecular fingerprints (e.g., ECFP, MACCS keys) derived from SMILES to create a numerical feature matrix suitable for machine learning models. These models can capture complex structural relationships and predict yields based on the molecular structure.

- **Advice 7**: **Avoid Ambiguous Concepts Difficult to Compute from SMILES**

  Remove or rephrase rules that rely on concepts like "steric hindrance" or "hydrophobic interactions" unless they can be quantified. For example, steric hindrance can be approximated by calculating the molecular volume or Van der Waals surface area.

- **Advice 8**: **Define Clear Structural Motifs for High and Low Yield**

  Create substructure patterns that can be matched to categorize modifiers:

  - **High Yield Motifs**:
    - Modifiers with **alpha-amino acids** with two carboxyl groups.
    - Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms** adjacent to carboxylic acids.
    - Aliphatic chains of **6-8 carbons** terminating with a carboxylic acid.

  - **Low Yield Motifs**:
    - Modifiers with **aldehyde or ketone groups** attached to aromatic rings.
    - Modifiers containing **flexible ether chains** with terminal polar groups.

- **Advice 9**: **Automate Substructure Matching Using SMARTS Patterns**

  Define SMARTS patterns for substructures associated with high or low yield. SMARTS allows for pattern recognition in molecules based on specific atomic and bonding arrangements, which can be applied directly to SMILES strings.

- **Advice 10**: **Iteratively Validate and Refine Rules**

  Apply the new rules to the dataset to generate a numeric feature matrix and test the correlation between predicted and actual yields. Refine the rules based on inconsistencies or misclassifications observed during validation.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an α-amino group enhances metal chelation and coordination with the catalyst, improving interaction and increasing yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxyl, sulfanyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance metal coordination with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination potential, leading to reduced catalytic interaction and lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole derivatives) result in high yield; however, when such rings are connected directly to another aromatic ring, the yield is low due to steric hindrance or electronic effects.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for metal ions, improving interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield. However, direct linkage of heteroaromatic rings to benzene rings may cause steric hindrance or alter electronic properties, reducing coordination effectiveness and yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, amido) onto the chain leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains promote hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Polar groups introduce polarity and can disrupt these interactions, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**), 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase opportunities for hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aromatic aldehyde or ketone groups directly attached to the ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains may not allow optimal alignment, reducing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains and only one carboxyl group result in low yield; those with additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., indole ring) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lack sufficient coordinating groups to interact effectively with the catalyst. Introducing additional functional groups capable of coordination enhances metal interaction and increases yield.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetamido groups result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects that reduce coordinating ability.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Trifluoroacetamido groups decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering metal coordination with the catalyst and leading to lower yield.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Rule Coverage with Additional Examples**

  - *Issue*: Several rules, such as **Rule 5** (modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups) and **Rule 8** (modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains), have limited coverage with only one or two supporting examples.
  - *Recommendation*: Expand these rules by including additional examples from existing or new data. For **Rule 5**, search for other polyhydroxylated acids that result in high yield to strengthen the rule's applicability. For **Rule 8**, identify more modifiers with fluorinated chains that lead to low yield to validate the rule.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Similar Rules to Reduce Redundancy**

  - *Issue*: Some rules overlap in their rationales and could be combined for simplicity. For instance, **Rule 2** and **Rule 12** both discuss the impact of electron-withdrawing groups on yield.
  - *Recommendation*: Merge rules that share similar principles. Combine **Rule 2** (electron-withdrawing groups on para-substituted benzoic acids) with **Rule 12** (modifiers containing trifluoroacetamido groups) into a unified rule about electron-withdrawing substituents leading to high or low yield depending on their position and nature.

- **Advice 3**: **Clarify Rules with Specific Structural Descriptions**

  - *Issue*: Some rules lack clarity due to ambiguous language or broad terms. For example, **Rule 3** mentions steric hindrance or electronic effects without specifying the structural features causing them.
  - *Recommendation*: Refine rules by providing detailed structural descriptions or including SMILES representations. For **Rule 3**, specify that direct conjugation between heteroaromatic rings and benzene rings (as in biphenyl structures) may reduce yield due to planarity restrictions and steric effects.

- **Advice 4**: **Adjust Complexity to Improve Practicality**

  - *Issue*: A few rules are highly specific, which may limit their practical use in modifier design. **Rule 9**, for instance, distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing acids with minimal supporting data.
  - *Recommendation*: Broaden overly specific rules or incorporate them into more general ones. Integrate **Rule 9** into a wider rule about functional groups that can lead to catalyst poisoning or deactivation, providing a more comprehensive guideline.

- **Advice 5**: **Strengthen Rules with Physicochemical Rationale**

  - *Issue*: Some rules could benefit from deeper physicochemical explanations to enhance understanding. For example, **Rule 7** mentions potential catalyst deactivation without detailing the mechanisms.
  - *Recommendation*: Augment the rationales with detailed explanations of how certain functional groups interact with the catalyst. In **Rule 7**, elaborate on how aldehyde or ketone groups may form strong complexes with metal centers, blocking active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Advice 6**: **Increase Data Diversity for Better Rule Validation**

  - *Issue*: The current dataset may not cover all modifier classes sufficiently, affecting the rules' robustness.
  - *Recommendation*: Include a wider variety of modifiers in the dataset, especially those that challenge existing rules. This will help test the rules' limits and ensure they are reliable across different chemical spaces.

- **Advice 7**: **Prioritize Rules Based on Impact and Frequency**

  - *Issue*: Not all rules may be equally important for optimizing yield.
  - *Recommendation*: Rank the rules according to their impact on yield and the frequency of applicable cases. Focus on refining high-impact rules like **Rule 2** and **Rule 4**, which have broader applicability, and ensure they are as clear and comprehensive as possible.

- **Advice 8**: **Provide Counterexamples Where Applicable**

  - *Issue*: Some rules lack counterexamples, which are essential for defining the rule's boundaries.
  - *Recommendation*: Include both supporting examples and counterexamples for each rule. For instance, in **Rule 5**, add low-yield examples of polyhydroxylated acids that do not follow the trend to highlight exceptions and refine the rule accordingly.

- **Advice 9**: **Review and Update Rules Based on New Insights**

  - *Issue*: As more data become available or new insights are gained, existing rules may need adjustments.
  - *Recommendation*: Establish a process for regularly reviewing and updating the rules. Encourage continuous feedback from experimental results to refine the rules, ensuring they remain current and effective.

- **Advice 10**: **Simplify Language for Better Accessibility**

  - *Issue*: Complex terminology and detailed chemical jargon may hinder understanding.
  - *Recommendation*: Use clear and concise language in the rules to make them accessible to a broader audience. Include definitions for technical terms or provide visual aids like structural diagrams to assist comprehension.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an α-amino group enhances metal chelation and coordination with the catalyst, improving interaction and increasing yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxyl, sulfanyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance metal coordination with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination potential, leading to reduced catalytic interaction and lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole derivatives) result in high yield; however, when such rings are connected directly to another aromatic ring, the yield is low due to steric hindrance or electronic effects.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for metal ions, improving interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield. However, direct linkage of heteroaromatic rings to benzene rings may cause steric hindrance or alter electronic properties, reducing coordination effectiveness and yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, amido) onto the chain leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains promote hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Polar groups introduce polarity and can disrupt these interactions, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**), 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase opportunities for hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aromatic aldehyde or ketone groups directly attached to the ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains may not allow optimal alignment, reducing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains and only one carboxyl group result in low yield; those with additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., indole ring) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lack sufficient coordinating groups to interact effectively with the catalyst. Introducing additional functional groups capable of coordination enhances metal interaction and increases yield.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetamido groups result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects that reduce coordinating ability.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Trifluoroacetamido groups decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering metal coordination with the catalyst and leading to lower yield.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Fix pattern matching for count thresholds in Rule 1**. The `count_threshold` in Rule 1 relies on matching the SMARTS string keys exactly as they appear in `pat.GetSmarts()`. However, `pat.GetSmarts()` may not return the same string as the original pattern due to internal canonicalization. Modify the code to map patterns to thresholds more reliably. One way is to use the index of the pattern in the `patterns` list or to store the compiled pattern objects as keys in the `count_threshold` dictionary.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct the SMARTS patterns for Rule 11**. The pattern for `amino_acid_coord_group` in Rule 11 is incorrectly specified as `'[NX3H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1] [n]'`, which includes a space and may not be valid. Replace the space with appropriate bonding to connect the indole ring. For example, use `'[NX3H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` with an additional pattern to match the indole ring connected to the amino acid side chain.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Ensure all SMARTS patterns are correctly formatted and valid**. Review all SMARTS patterns in the code for syntax errors or misrepresentations. For instance, in Rule 2, verify that the patterns correctly identify para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups. Adjust the patterns to accurately reflect the substitution patterns on the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Modify the code to handle multiple substructures and their relationships**. In many rules, the presence or absence of certain groups in specific positions is crucial. Enhance the code to check not only for the presence of substructures but also their connectivity and relative positions. Utilize more advanced SMARTS patterns or substructure queries that capture these relationships.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Implement detailed debugging and logging**. Add logging statements to output which patterns are matched for each molecule and rule. This will help identify where mismatches occur and facilitate debugging. Logging the matches can also verify if the rules are over-predicting or under-predicting matches.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Test the rules individually with known examples**. Before applying the rules to the entire dataset, test each rule with molecules known to match or not match. Ensure that the code correctly identifies these cases. This step can help verify that each rule functions as intended before integrating them.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Avoid reliance on exact SMARTS string matching in count thresholds**. Since SMARTS strings can be canonicalized differently, modify the code to avoid relying on exact string matches. Consider associating the count thresholds directly with the pattern objects or using labels or indices to track which patterns the thresholds apply to.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Review and adjust exclude patterns**. Ensure that the exclude patterns (`'exclude_patterns'`) in each rule are correctly specified and compiled. Verify that they effectively prevent matches when intended, and adjust them if they are too broad or too narrow.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Simplify and standardize pattern definitions**. Create a consistent approach to defining and compiling SMARTS patterns. Possibly use helper functions to create patterns, especially when patterns are complex or repeated across rules. This can reduce errors and improve readability.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Consult cheminformatics experts or use cheminformatics tools**. If available, use cheminformatics software or consult with experts to validate the SMARTS patterns and ensure that they accurately represent the chemical features described in the natural language rules.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Performance of the Current Rules Based on the Metrics**

Upon analyzing the provided metrics, we observe the following trends when comparing the current rule metrics to the reference metrics:

1. **Train Support**:
   - **Reference Metrics**: 0.1667 and 0.1845
   - **Current Metric**: 0.0229

   The **train support** has significantly decreased from the reference values. This indicates that the current rules apply to a much smaller portion of the training data compared to the previous iteration.

2. **Train Confidence**:
   - **Reference Metrics**: 0.6352 and 0.5396
   - **Current Metric**: 0.7067

   The **train confidence** has increased, suggesting that when the current rules do apply, they predict the outcome correctly more often than the previous rules.

3. **Train Lift**:
   - **Reference Metrics**: 1.2048 and 1.0559
   - **Current Metric**: 1.4163

   The **train lift** has also improved, indicating that the current rules provide a stronger association between the rule conditions and the predictions, compared to random chance.

4. **Train Leverage**:
   - **Reference Metrics**: 0.0289 and -0.0041
   - **Current Metric**: 0.0097

   The **train leverage** remains positive, suggesting that the current rules still capture associations that are not due to random chance. However, it is lower than the highest reference leverage.

**Analysis of Metrics**

- **Improved Confidence and Lift**: The increase in confidence and lift indicates that the rules are becoming more accurate when they are applicable. A higher confidence means that the proportion of correct predictions when the rule conditions are met has increased. Similarly, a higher lift suggests that the rules are more effective at predicting the outcome compared to the overall baseline probability.

- **Decreased Support**: The significant drop in support implies that the rules apply to a smaller subset of data. While the predictions are more accurate for this subset, the rules are not generalizing well across the entire dataset.

- **Trade-off Between Support and Confidence**: There is a noticeable trade-off where increasing the specificity of the rules (leading to higher confidence and lift) reduces the support. This suggests that the rules are becoming too specialized, possibly overfitting to specific instances in the training data.

**Determining if a Local Minimum Has Been Reached**

Given the current metrics, it appears that further iterations are yielding diminishing returns in terms of overall rule performance:

- **Marginal Gains in Confidence and Lift**: Recent iterations show only incremental improvements in confidence and lift, while support continues to decrease.
- **Potential Overfitting**: The high confidence with low support indicates that the rules may be overfitting to specific instances, capturing noise rather than underlying patterns.
- **Plateau in Metrics**: The metrics suggest that a local minimum may have been reached, where improvements in one metric adversely affect another.

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the rules while balancing support, confidence, and lift, consider the following strategies:

1. **Balance Specificity and Generality**:
   - **Assess Rule Specificity**: Identify rules that are overly specific and generalize them to cover a broader range of data.
   - **Example**: If a rule specifies a particular substituent on a molecule, consider generalizing to a class of similar substituents that share chemical properties.

2. **Merge and Optimize Rules**:
   - **Combine Overlapping Rules**: Look for rules that have similar conditions or predict the same outcome and merge them to increase support.
   - **Simplify Rule Conditions**: Remove redundant conditions that do not significantly contribute to confidence or lift.

3. **Increase Support Without Sacrificing Confidence**:
   - **Expand Rule Conditions**: Slightly relax the conditions of the rules to include more instances while monitoring the impact on confidence.
   - **Threshold Adjustment**: Re-evaluate the thresholds used in the rules (e.g., chain length, number of substituents) to find optimal values that balance support and confidence.

4. **Incorporate Negative Examples**:
   - **Analyze Misclassifications**: Study instances where the rules predict incorrectly to identify patterns that could refine the rules.
   - **Introduce Exclusion Criteria**: Add conditions to the rules that exclude known low-yield modifiers, improving precision.

5. **Focus on High-Impact Features**:
   - **Feature Importance Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis to determine which molecular features most strongly correlate with high yield.
   - **Prioritize Key Functional Groups**: Emphasize functional groups or molecular structures that have the most significant impact on yield in the rules.

6. **Iterate with Cross-Validation**:
   - **Cross-Validate Rules**: Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules perform well on unseen data, preventing overfitting.
   - **Monitor Test Metrics**: Since only training metrics are provided, incorporate test metrics to evaluate generalizability.

7. **Review and Refine Individual Rules**:
   - **Rule Complexity**: Ensure that each rule is as simple as possible without losing predictive power.
   - **Eliminate Redundant Rules**: Remove rules that do not significantly contribute to overall performance or that duplicate the effects of other rules.

8. **Consider Alternative Modeling Approaches**:
   - **Machine Learning Models**: Utilize statistical or machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to identify patterns that may not be apparent through manual rule creation.
   - **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine rule-based methods with data-driven models to capture both expert knowledge and patterns in the data.

**Conclusion**

The current rules demonstrate improved confidence and lift but suffer from low support, indicating that they are too narrowly focused. To enhance the performance:

- **Aim for a Balanced Rule Set**: Strive to create rules that maintain high confidence and lift while covering a more significant portion of the data.
- **Avoid Overfitting**: Ensure that the rules capture generalizable patterns rather than specific instances.
- **Further Iterations Needed**: Continue refining the rules with the strategies outlined, monitoring the metrics to achieve an optimal balance.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be improved to provide more comprehensive and accurate predictions, ultimately advancing the research program's goals.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Evaluation of Effectiveness**

The current classification model achieved a 5-fold cross-validation accuracy of **62.86%**, which is an improvement over some previous iterations (e.g., 48.57% and 51.43%) but still below the reference accuracies of around **76%**. This indicates that while the current rules contribute positively to the model's predictive capability compared to earlier iterations, there is still substantial room for improvement to reach the benchmark performance.

**2. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

Given that the validation accuracy is relatively low and there is no significant overperformance on the training set reported, it suggests that the model may be **underfitting**. The rules may not be capturing all the relevant patterns in the data, or they might be too generalized to distinguish between modifiers effectively. The consistency in moderate accuracies across iterations without significant fluctuations implies that overfitting is less of a concern at this stage.

**3. Analysis of Discrepancies via SHAP Values**

Examining the SHAP analysis reveals patterns in the misclassifications:

- **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

  - Molecules such as **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N** and **C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O** have low predicted loadings but high experimental values.
  - For these molecules, **Rule 3** consistently has a high negative SHAP value (e.g., -0.0412 and -0.0833), indicating that it significantly contributes to the underestimation.

- **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

  - There are fewer instances reported in the latest iteration where the predicted loading is high, but the experimental value is low.
  - In cases where the predicted loading is high and the experimental value is high (correct predictions), **Rule 3** has a high positive SHAP value (e.g., 0.5357).

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

The gradual increase in accuracy from previous iterations suggests that adjustments to the rules have had some positive impact. However, the plateauing below the benchmark indicates that **further refinement is necessary**. The current rules are partially effective but may not capture all the nuances required for higher predictive performance.

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Influence of Rule 3:**

  - **Rule 3** appears to have a significant impact on the model's predictions, as evidenced by its substantial SHAP values in both positive and negative directions.
  - The negative SHAP values for underpredicted molecules suggest that **Rule 3 may be incorrectly penalizing certain modifiers**, leading to low predicted loadings despite high experimental values.

- **Opportunities for Improvement:**

  - Review and refine **Rule 3** to ensure it accurately reflects the contributions of heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms.
  - Consider whether exceptions or additional conditions are needed to address cases where the rule leads to underestimation.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule 3 to Reduce Underestimation:**

   - **Issue Identified:** Rule 3's negative impact on certain molecules suggests it may be too restrictive or not fully capturing the variability in modifiers with heteroaromatic nitrogen-containing rings.
   - **Suggested Action:**
     - **Re-express Rule 3** to account for modifiers where the heteroaromatic ring is connected to specific substituents that mitigate steric hindrance or electronic effects.
     - **Incorporate Exceptions:** Identify and include exceptions for molecules that do not conform to the steric hindrance or electronic effect assumptions but still result in high yield.
     - **Example Adjustment:**
       - Modify the rule to state that while most heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms lead to high yield, certain structural features (e.g., specific substituents or ring positions) may influence this outcome differently.

2. **Introduce Additional Rules or Modify Existing Ones:**

   - **Address Overlooked Patterns:**
     - Scan the dataset for patterns not currently captured by the existing rules, especially focusing on the underpredicted molecules.
   - **Consider New Functional Groups or Structural Features:**
     - Investigate whether other functional groups or structural motifs are present in the misclassified high-yield modifiers.
   - **Modify Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
     - Besides Rule 3, assess if any other rules consistently contribute negative SHAP values to underpredicted molecules and refine them accordingly.

3. **Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting:**

   - **Enhance Rule Specificity:**
     - Make the rules more specific where necessary to improve discrimination between high and low yield modifiers.
   - **Balance Rule Complexity:**
     - Ensure that the rules are neither too simplistic (leading to underfitting) nor too complex (risking overfitting).

4. **Iterative Evaluation and Refinement:**

   - **Validate Changes with New Iterations:**
     - After refining the rules, rerun the model and assess the impact on validation accuracy and SHAP values.
   - **Monitor SHAP Contributions:**
     - Use SHAP analysis in each iteration to identify any new issues arising from rule changes.

5. **Consider Cross-Interactions Between Rules:**

   - **Explore Synergistic Effects:**
     - Analyze whether combinations of rules are contributing unexpectedly to predictions.
   - **Adjust Rule Hierarchies or Weightings:**
     - If certain rules are overshadowing others due to their weightings, consider adjusting their influence in the model.

**Conclusion**

By closely examining the SHAP values and their impact on model predictions, particularly focusing on **Rule 3**, we can identify specific areas where the current rules may be refined. Adjusting Rule 3 to better reflect the nuances in the data and expanding the rule set to capture overlooked patterns can help improve the model's accuracy. Iterative refinement, guided by SHAP analysis, will aid in developing a more robust set of rules that better generalize across the dataset, moving closer to the benchmark performance.

**Summary of the Discussions and Directions for Optimizing the Current Rules**

**Overview:**

The current objective is to improve a set of rules derived from SMILES representations of molecular modifiers to predict the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. These rules are designed to capture the relationship between molecular structures and their catalytic effects when used with a modified catalyst (Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)).

**Performance Metrics:**

- **Rule Metrics:**
  - **Train Support:** The current rules apply to only **2.29%** of the training data (support of 0.0229), which is significantly lower than previous supports of 16.67% and 18.45%.
  - **Train Confidence:** The confidence has improved to **70.67%**, indicating that when the rules apply, they correctly predict the outcome in about 71% of cases.
  - **Train Lift:** The lift has increased to **1.416**, suggesting the rules are more effective than random guessing.
  - **Train Leverage:** A positive leverage of **0.0097** indicates a positive association between the rules and the outcome.

- **Accuracy and SHAP Analysis:**
  - **Validation Accuracy:** The 5-fold cross-validation accuracy is **62.86%**, an improvement over previous iterations but still below the benchmark of **76%**.
  - **SHAP Analysis:** The SHAP values reveal that **Rule 3** significantly contributes to misclassifications, particularly underpredicting the yield for certain molecules.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Low Support:** The rules cover a small fraction of the dataset, indicating they may be too specific.
2. **Moderate Confidence and Lift:** While confidence and lift have improved, they come at the expense of support, suggesting a trade-off.
3. **Underfitting:** The overall accuracy is moderate, and the model may not be capturing all relevant patterns.
4. **Rule 3's Negative Impact:** Rule 3, intended to predict high yield for certain heteroaromatic carboxylic acids, is contributing to incorrect predictions.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Refine Rule 3 to Address Misclassifications:**

   - **Issue:** Rule 3 may be too restrictive or incorrectly specified, leading to false negatives.
   - **Action:**
     - **Reevaluate the SMARTS Patterns:** Ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately represent the intended molecular features without unnecessary constraints.
     - **Adjust Rule Conditions:** Modify Rule 3 to account for exceptions and reduce the negative impact on SHAP values. For example, consider the position of nitrogen atoms and their electronic effects.
     - **Include Additional Features:** Incorporate other relevant functional groups or structural motifs that may influence the yield.

2. **Increase Rule Support by Generalizing Conditions:**

   - **Issue:** Low support suggests the rules are not covering enough data.
   - **Action:**
     - **Broaden Rule Applicability:** Slightly relax stringent conditions to include more molecules while monitoring confidence levels.
     - **Combine Similar Rules:** Merge overlapping rules to increase support without sacrificing accuracy.
     - **Example:** In Rule 2, include a wider range of electron-withdrawing groups beyond nitro and bromomethyl.

3. **Review and Correct SMARTS Patterns for Accuracy:**

   - **Issue:** Some SMARTS patterns may be incorrectly formatted or overly specific.
   - **Action:**
     - **Validate Patterns:** Use cheminformatics tools to check SMARTS syntax and ensure they match the intended chemical structures.
     - **Avoid Dependency on Exact String Matching:** Modify the code to associate patterns based on their objects rather than string representations to prevent mismatches due to canonicalization.

4. **Adjust Thresholds and Include Quantitative Criteria:**

   - **Issue:** Rigid thresholds may exclude relevant molecules.
   - **Action:**
     - **Optimize Threshold Values:** Reassess numeric thresholds (e.g., chain lengths, counts) using statistical analyses to find optimal ranges.
     - **Incorporate Quantitative Descriptors:** Use molecular descriptors (e.g., logP, molecular weight) to refine rules quantitatively.

5. **Improve Exclude Patterns and Negative Conditions:**

   - **Issue:** Exclude patterns may not effectively filter out undesired matches.
   - **Action:**
     - **Refine Exclude SMARTS Patterns:** Ensure that exclude patterns accurately represent the unwanted substructures.
     - **Test Exclude Conditions Individually:** Verify that excluded molecules are correctly identified in the dataset.

6. **Simplify and Clarify Rule Definitions:**

   - **Issue:** Complex or ambiguous rules can lead to implementation errors.
   - **Action:**
     - **Simplify Rules Where Possible:** Remove unnecessary complexity without losing essential predictive power.
     - **Standardize Rule Format:** Use a consistent structure for all rules to enhance readability and maintenance.

7. **Add New Rules to Capture Missing Patterns:**

   - **Issue:** Some molecular features influencing yield may not be represented.
   - **Action:**
     - **Analyze Misclassified Molecules:** Identify common features among misclassified modifiers and develop new rules accordingly.
     - **Consider Opposite Scenarios:** For instance, if certain electron-donating groups consistently lead to low yield, explicitly include this in the rules.

8. **Enhance Rule Testing and Validation:**

   - **Issue:** Without thorough testing, errors in rules may go unnoticed.
   - **Action:**
     - **Implement Unit Tests for Each Rule:** Test rules against known examples to ensure they function as intended.
     - **Use Detailed Logging:** Record matching molecules for each rule to facilitate debugging and refinement.

9. **Leverage Machine Learning Insights:**

   - **Issue:** Manual rules may miss complex patterns.
   - **Action:**
     - **Use Machine Learning Models:** Train models like decision trees to identify additional patterns, which can inform rule adjustments.
     - **Combine Data-Driven and Expert Knowledge:** Integrate findings from machine learning with chemical expertise to enhance rules.

10. **Iteratively Refine Rules with Cross-Validation Feedback:**

    - **Issue:** Need to ensure rules generalize well and do not overfit.
    - **Action:**
      - **Monitor Validation Metrics Continuously:** Use cross-validation results to guide rule refinement.
      - **Avoid Overfitting by Keeping Rules General Enough:** Ensure that rules do not become so specific that they only fit the training data.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Yes, there is significant potential for further optimizing the current rules without overfitting. By addressing issues such as low support, refining problematic rules like Rule 3, and incorporating additional relevant molecular features, the model's performance can be improved. Careful validation and iterative refinement will help enhance the rules' predictive power while maintaining their generalizability.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an α-amino group enhances metal chelation and coordination with the catalyst, improving interaction and increasing yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxyl, sulfanyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance metal coordination with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination potential, leading to reduced catalytic interaction and lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole derivatives) result in high yield; however, when such rings are connected directly to another aromatic ring, the yield is low due to steric hindrance or electronic effects.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for metal ions, improving interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield. However, direct linkage of heteroaromatic rings to benzene rings may cause steric hindrance or alter electronic properties, reducing coordination effectiveness and yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, amido) onto the chain leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains promote hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Polar groups introduce polarity and can disrupt these interactions, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**), 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase opportunities for hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aromatic aldehyde or ketone groups directly attached to the ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can interact beneficially with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes with the metal center, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers where an aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains may not allow optimal alignment, reducing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains and only one carboxyl group result in low yield; those with additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., indole ring) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lack sufficient coordinating groups to interact effectively with the catalyst. Introducing additional functional groups capable of coordination enhances metal interaction and increases yield.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetamido groups result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects that reduce coordinating ability.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Trifluoroacetamido groups decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering metal coordination with the catalyst and leading to lower yield.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Refine Rule 3 by adjusting the SMARTS patterns to accurately represent heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms. Expand the patterns to include nitrogen atoms in different positions within the ring and allow for variations in ring structures. Ensure the rule does not exclude relevant molecules due to overly strict conditions.

- **Advice 2**: Increase rule support by generalizing conditions in existing rules. Relax stringent criteria to include more molecules without significantly lowering confidence. For example, in Rule 2, include a broader range of electron-withdrawing groups beyond nitro and bromomethyl substituents, such as cyano, trifluoromethyl, or halogens.

- **Advice 3**: Review and correct all SMARTS patterns for accuracy. Validate each pattern using cheminformatics tools to ensure they match the intended molecular features. Avoid dependencies on exact SMILES string matching by focusing on substructure patterns rather than specific representations.

- **Advice 4**: Simplify and clarify rule definitions by removing unnecessary complexity and standardizing the format. Combine similar rules where appropriate to enhance readability and reduce potential implementation errors. For instance, merge Rules 2 and 7 if they both address the influence of substituents on aromatic rings.

- **Advice 5**: Add new rules to capture missing patterns observed in misclassified molecules. Analyze molecules that are incorrectly predicted and identify common features. For example, if modifiers with certain electron-donating groups consistently result in low yield, create a rule to account for this observation.

- **Advice 6**: Adjust thresholds and include quantitative criteria in the rules. Reassess numerical thresholds like chain lengths or the number of functional groups using statistical analyses to determine optimal ranges. Incorporate molecular descriptors such as hydrophobicity (log P) or molecular weight to refine the rules quantitatively.

- **Advice 7**: Improve exclude patterns and negative conditions by refining SMARTS patterns used to filter out undesired matches. Test and validate these patterns individually to ensure they effectively exclude molecules that should not be matched by the rules.

- **Advice 8**: Enhance rule testing and validation by implementing unit tests for each rule. Test the rules against known examples from the dataset to confirm they function as intended. Use detailed logging to record which molecules match each rule to facilitate debugging and refinement.

- **Advice 9**: Leverage machine learning insights by training models like decision trees on the dataset to identify additional patterns. Use these insights to adjust existing rules or develop new ones, combining data-driven findings with chemical expertise.

- **Advice 10**: Iteratively refine the rules using cross-validation feedback. Continuously monitor validation metrics to guide adjustments. Ensure the rules are general enough to avoid overfitting while effectively capturing patterns that influence reaction yield.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylate groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions, enhancing coordination with the catalyst and improving yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, amido) onto the chain leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains facilitate hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Polar groups introduce polarity that can disrupt these interactions, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are small aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups interact favorably with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring and not directly connected to other aromatic rings result in high yield; direct linkage to another aromatic ring results in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for metal ions, improving interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield. Direct linkage to another aromatic ring can cause steric hindrance or alter electronic properties, reducing coordination effectiveness and yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; some electron-donating groups (e.g., amino) can also result in high yield if they enhance metal coordination.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance metal coordination with the catalyst. Certain electron-donating groups like amino can also coordinate directly with metal centers, improving yield. Groups that lead to catalyst deactivation or side reactions (e.g., formyl) result in low yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase opportunities for hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains result in high yield if the side chain contains additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan); those lacking such groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of additional coordination sites in the side chain enhances metal interaction with the catalyst, increasing yield. Side chains without coordinating groups are less effective in promoting catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aromatic aldehyde or ketone groups directly attached to the ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are long-chain ω-amino acids (more than six carbons) result in low yield; shorter-chain ω-amino acids (five carbons or fewer) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Shorter-chain ω-amino acids may interact more effectively with the catalyst due to optimal chain length and reduced flexibility, enhancing yield. Longer chains may introduce too much flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective binding.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are 4-substituted phenylalkanoic acids where the alkanoic chain has four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains may not allow optimal alignment, reducing yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl or other strongly electron-withdrawing acyl groups result in low yield due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of potential donor atoms (e.g., amino groups) to coordinate with the metal catalyst, leading to lower yield.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylate groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions, enhancing coordination with the catalyst and improving yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, amido) onto the chain leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains facilitate hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Polar groups introduce polarity that can disrupt these interactions, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are small aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups interact favorably with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring and not directly connected to other aromatic rings result in high yield; direct linkage to another aromatic ring results in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for metal ions, improving interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield. Direct linkage to another aromatic ring can cause steric hindrance or alter electronic properties, reducing coordination effectiveness and yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; some electron-donating groups (e.g., amino) can also result in high yield if they enhance metal coordination.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance metal coordination with the catalyst. Certain electron-donating groups like amino can also coordinate directly with metal centers, improving yield. Groups that lead to catalyst deactivation or side reactions (e.g., formyl) result in low yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase opportunities for hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains result in high yield if the side chain contains additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan); those lacking such groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of additional coordination sites in the side chain enhances metal interaction with the catalyst, increasing yield. Side chains without coordinating groups are less effective in promoting catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aromatic aldehyde or ketone groups directly attached to the ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are long-chain ω-amino acids (more than six carbons) result in low yield; shorter-chain ω-amino acids (five carbons or fewer) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Shorter-chain ω-amino acids may interact more effectively with the catalyst due to optimal chain length and reduced flexibility, enhancing yield. Longer chains may introduce too much flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective binding.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are 4-substituted phenylalkanoic acids where the alkanoic chain has four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains may not allow optimal alignment, reducing yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl or other strongly electron-withdrawing acyl groups result in low yield due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of potential donor atoms (e.g., amino groups) to coordinate with the metal catalyst, leading to lower yield.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been carefully developed by analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties of the modifiers. They combine multiple substructures and functional groups to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield in the reaction.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct the SMARTS pattern for 'Rule 2 High' to accurately match unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons).** The current pattern `'[CH2]' * 5 + carboxylic_acid` does not correctly match compounds like octanoic acid because it attaches the carboxylic acid group at the end of the chain instead of the beginning. Update the pattern to `'[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` to represent a linear chain of 6–8 carbons ending with a carboxylic acid group. This pattern starts with a methyl group followed by 4 to 6 methylene groups and ends with the carboxylic acid, accurately reflecting the structure of medium-chain fatty acids.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Adjust the exclusion patterns for 'Rule 2 High' to prevent unintended exclusions.** The current exclusion pattern `'[!#6;!#1]'` may exclude valid carbon chains because it rejects any atom that is not carbon or hydrogen, potentially affecting the chain matching. Remove this from the exclusion list. Instead, focus on excluding specific polar functional groups. Modify the exclusion list to include patterns like `'[OX2H]', '[NX3;!$([NX3](C)(C)C)]', '[CX3](=O)[NX3]'` to exclude hydroxyl groups, amines (excluding quaternary amines), and amides, respectively.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Modify the 'Rule 2 Low' patterns to correctly identify aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar groups on the chain.** The current pattern `'[CH2]{5,7}' + carboxylic_acid` may not correctly match compounds with substituents on the chain. Update the pattern to `'[CH2]{3,5}[OX2H,NX3][CH2]{0,2}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` to specifically look for an aliphatic chain of 6–8 carbons with a polar group (hydroxyl or amino) attached. Ensure the 'include' patterns are `[OX2H]`, `[NX3;H2]`, and `[CX3](=O)[NX3]` to match hydroxyls, primary amines, and amides, respectively.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Verify and correct other SMARTS patterns to ensure they accurately represent the natural language rules.** For example:

  - For **'Rule 3 High'**, ensure the pattern correctly matches small aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids by adjusting it to `'[CX4][SX2H]'` connected to a carboxylic acid `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`, and exclude aromatic systems with `'[$(a)]'`.

  - For **'Rule 5 High'**, the pattern for electron-withdrawing groups should include nitro groups and halomethyl groups attached to an aromatic ring: `'[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` with substituents like `'[c][N+](=O)[O-]', '[c][CH2][Br,Cl]'`.

  - For **'Rule 7 High'**, adjust the pattern to match amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating functional groups like an indole ring. Use patterns that specifically look for tryptophan-like structures.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Add detailed comments and documentation within the code for clarity.** This helps collaborators understand the intent behind each pattern and makes maintenance easier. Explain the rationale for each SMARTS pattern and any assumptions made.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Implement unit tests for the pattern matching.** Create a set of test cases with known modifiers and expected outcomes for each rule. Use these tests to validate that the code correctly identifies matches and non-matches, ensuring the feature matrix accurately reflects the rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylate groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions, enhancing coordination with the catalyst and improving yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, amido) onto the chain leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains facilitate hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Polar groups introduce polarity that can disrupt these interactions, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are small aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids result in high yield; those with aromatic thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups interact favorably with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or form irreversible complexes, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring and not directly connected to other aromatic rings result in high yield; direct linkage to another aromatic ring results in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for metal ions, improving interaction with the catalyst and increasing yield. Direct linkage to another aromatic ring can cause steric hindrance or alter electronic properties, reducing coordination effectiveness and yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; some electron-donating groups (e.g., amino) can also result in high yield if they enhance metal coordination.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance metal coordination with the catalyst. Certain electron-donating groups like amino can also coordinate directly with metal centers, improving yield. Groups that lead to catalyst deactivation or side reactions (e.g., formyl) result in low yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase opportunities for hydrogen bonding and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains result in high yield if the side chain contains additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan); those lacking such groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of additional coordination sites in the side chain enhances metal interaction with the catalyst, increasing yield. Side chains without coordinating groups are less effective in promoting catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt various conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density available for metal coordination and increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, disrupting interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aromatic aldehyde or ketone groups directly attached to the ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings can form unwanted complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are long-chain ω-amino acids (more than six carbons) result in low yield; shorter-chain ω-amino acids (five carbons or fewer) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Shorter-chain ω-amino acids may interact more effectively with the catalyst due to optimal chain length and reduced flexibility, enhancing yield. Longer chains may introduce too much flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective binding.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are 4-substituted phenylalkanoic acids where the alkanoic chain has four or more carbons result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide necessary flexibility and spacing for effective interactions between the aromatic ring and the catalyst, enhancing binding and catalytic performance. Shorter chains may not allow optimal alignment, reducing yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl or other strongly electron-withdrawing acyl groups result in low yield due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of potential donor atoms (e.g., amino groups) to coordinate with the metal catalyst, leading to lower yield.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: In **Rule 2 High**, the exclude pattern `'[OX2H]'` is too general and incorrectly excludes molecules containing the carboxylic acid group itself, since carboxylic acids have a hydroxyl group. To fix this, modify the exclude pattern to specifically exclude hydroxyl groups that are **not part of the carboxylic acid**. Use a more precise pattern like `'[OX2H;$([!$(C(=O)[OX2H1])])]'` to exclude hydroxyl groups not attached to a carbonyl group.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: In **Rule 2 Low**, the include pattern `'[OX2H]'` incorrectly matches the carboxylic acid hydroxyl group. To accurately detect polar hydroxyl groups **on the chain**, refine the pattern to exclude the carboxylic acid hydroxyl. Use a pattern like `'[CX4;!$(C=O)]-[OX2H]'` to match hydroxyl groups attached to non-carbonyl carbons.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: In **Rule 3 High**, the exclude pattern `'[a]'` only checks for the presence of any aromatic atoms, which may not adequately exclude aromatic thiol groups if the thiol is on an aliphatic chain elsewhere in the molecule. Modify the pattern to ensure the **thiol group is not attached to an aromatic ring**, such as defining the thiol group as `'[SX2H][CX4;!$(C=a)]'` to ensure it's connected to an aliphatic carbon.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: In **Rule 5 High**, the pattern for electron-withdrawing groups `'[c][N+](=O)[O-]'` and `'[c][CH2][Br,Cl]'` may miss other important electron-withdrawing groups. Expand the patterns to include other common electron-withdrawing groups, like cyano (`'[c][C]#N'`), trifluoromethyl (`'[c][C](F)(F)F'`), or halogens directly attached to the ring (`'[c][Cl,Br,I,F]'`).

- ** Suggestion 5 **: In **Rule 5 Low**, the pattern `'[cH]1ccc([CH3]|[CX3H]=O)cc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` may incorrectly match molecules where the methyl or formyl group is not at the para position. Ensure that the substituents are specifically at the **para position** by using a pattern like `'c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` with the appropriate substitution at the 4-position.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: In **Rule 7 High and Low**, the patterns provided are specific to tryptophan and phenylalanine, respectively, and may not capture other amino acids with aromatic side chains. Generalize the patterns to match other **aromatic amino acids** with or without additional coordinating groups. For example, use `'[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX4][c;a])C(=O)[OX2H1]'` and include or exclude patterns based on the presence of coordinating groups like `'[nH]`' for indole in tryptophan.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For **Rule 8**, the pattern `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2H]'` may be too specific and miss other flexible ether chains with terminal polar groups. Generalize the pattern to detect ether chains of varying lengths, such as `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4]([OX2][CX4]){1,3}[OX2H]'`.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: In **Rule 9**, ensure that the fluorinated alkyl chain pattern `'[CX4](F)(F)(F)'` captures chains with multiple fluorines along the chain, not just trifluoromethyl groups. Use a more general pattern like `'[CX4;R0][CF2][CF2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` to detect perfluorinated chains.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Review all **exclude** and **include** patterns to ensure they do not unintentionally match or exclude functional groups **integral to the molecule** (e.g., excluding carboxylic acid hydroxyls in patterns where carboxylic acids are required). Refine patterns using recursive SMARTS definitions or atom mapping to accurately capture the intended substructures.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Incorporate unit tests with **known positive and negative examples** for each rule to validate that the SMARTS patterns correctly match the intended molecules. This will help identify and correct any mismatches between the code and the natural language rules.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the rules by focusing on key structural features and functional groups that directly correlate with yield, making them easier to translate into numerical features.**

  - *Action*: Identify and list specific functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amino groups, thiols) and structural motifs (e.g., chain length, ring systems) that are associated with high or low yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Replace qualitative descriptors with quantitative criteria in the rules to eliminate ambiguity.**

  - *Action*: Specify exact chain lengths, numbers of functional groups, or positions of substituents. For example, instead of "medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons)," state "hydrocarbon chains with exactly 6 to 8 carbon atoms."

- **Advice 3**: **Merge overlapping rules to reduce redundancy and improve clarity.**

  - *Action*: Combine rules that deal with similar structural features or functional groups. For example, integrate Rules 2 and 11 by creating a general rule about the impact of chain length and functional groups on yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Develop a standardized set of molecular descriptors that can be computed from SMILES strings for each modifier.**

  - *Action*: Use cheminformatics tools to calculate properties such as molecular weight, logP (hydrophobicity), topological polar surface area, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and counts of specific functional groups.

- **Advice 5**: **Implement a scoring system where each modifier is evaluated based on the presence or absence of beneficial or detrimental structural features identified in the rules.**

  - *Action*: Assign positive scores to features associated with high yield and negative scores to those linked to low yield, enabling a quantitative assessment of each modifier.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate physicochemical properties into the rules to capture effects not evident from structure alone.**

  - *Action*: Include properties like pKa values, electron density, and steric hindrance, which can influence metal coordination and catalyst interaction.

- **Advice 7**: **Use statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to validate and refine the rules based on the dataset.**

  - *Action*: Apply regression or classification models to identify the most significant features affecting yield, allowing for data-driven optimization of the rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Expand the dataset with additional examples to strengthen the statistical significance of the rules.**

  - *Action*: Include more modifiers with known yields, especially those that challenge existing rules, to better define the boundaries and exceptions.

- **Advice 9**: **Clearly define exceptions and limitations within each rule to improve their predictive accuracy.**

  - *Action*: For each rule, list known exceptions and specify conditions under which the rule may not apply.

- **Advice 10**: **Enhance the rules to be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, ensuring all possible modifiers are accounted for without overlap.**

  - *Action*: Review and adjust the rules so that each modifier fits into one rule only, eliminating ambiguities in classification.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group adjacent to two carboxylic acid groups allows for effective chelation with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) onto the chain leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, promoting effective binding. Polar substituents disrupt these interactions and may interfere with the catalyst's active sites, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance coordination with metal ions in the catalyst. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and may diminish effective coordination, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing accessible nitrogen atoms in the ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in high yield; if the nitrogen is sterically hindered or the ring is fused to another aromatic system, the yield is lower.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can act as coordination sites with metal centers, enhancing catalyst-modifier interactions. Steric hindrance or additional aromatic rings can inhibit this coordination, reducing yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids with short chains result in high yield; aromatic thiol-containing acids result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols can interact favorably with the catalyst without strongly deactivating it. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly to metal centers, causing irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enable strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains result in high yield if the side chain contains additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan); those lacking such groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Aromatic side chains without coordinating groups are less effective, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or keto groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic systems can form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains may adopt conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups can engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the effectiveness of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density on potential donor atoms, reducing coordination ability. Increased hydrophobicity may disrupt interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; longer-chain ω-amino acids result in low yield due to decreased effective coordination.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Shorter ω-amino acids maintain optimal chain length for effective interaction with the catalyst. Longer chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are 4-substituted phenylalkanoic acids with aliphatic chains of four carbons or more result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and appropriate spacing for the aromatic ring to interact effectively with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not allow optimal alignment, reducing interaction and yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl or other strongly electron-withdrawing acyl groups attached to amino functions result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, hindering its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst and decreasing yield.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been developed by analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties of the modifiers. They combine multiple substructures and functional groups to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield in the reaction. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity to provide effective guidance for future modifier design.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and easy to apply, specifying that α-amino dicarboxylic acids result in high yield. It provides solid property insight by explaining the role of effective chelation with metal centers. The rule balances complexity by focusing on specific functional group combinations and has good coverage, supported by multiple data points (aspartic acid and glutamic acid).

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly states that unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (6–8 carbons) and no polar groups lead to high yield, while introducing polar groups leads to low yield. The property insight regarding hydrophobic interactions enhancing binding is well-articulated. The rule considers combinations of chain length and functional groups, and it is well-supported by data (e.g., octanoic acid for high yield and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid for low yield).

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 distinguishes between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating para-substituents on benzoic acids, correlating them with high and low yield, respectively. The clarity is excellent, and the property insight about acidity affecting coordination is strong. Complexity is appropriate, involving substituent effects, and the rule has good coverage with multiple supporting data points.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in specifying that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with accessible nitrogen atoms yield high results, while sterically hindered ones do not. The property insight about nitrogen atoms acting as coordination sites is insightful. The rule combines structural features and steric considerations, achieving a balanced complexity, and is supported by data such as nicotinic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 effectively contrasts aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids, citing catalyst poisoning as a reason for low yield with aromatic thiols. It is clear and provides good property insight. The complexity is balanced, focusing on both the thiol group and the nature of the chain (aliphatic vs. aromatic). Coverage is adequate, with supporting examples like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield).

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 states that polyhydroxylated acids result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding. The rule is clear and provides strong property insight. It considers combinations of multiple hydroxyl groups and aliphatic chains, adding appropriate complexity. Coverage is sufficient with data points like gluconic acid demonstrating high yield.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clarifies that amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating groups result in high yield, while those lacking such groups do not. The property insight regarding coordination with metal centers is well-explained. Complexity is balanced, combining amino acid structure with side-chain functionality. The rule is supported by data (e.g., tryptophan for high yield and phenylalanine for low yield).

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 specifies that modifiers with aldehyde or keto groups attached to aromatic rings result in low yield, providing clarity. The property insight about potential catalyst deactivation is sound. The rule has appropriate complexity by focusing on functional groups and their positions and is supported by multiple data points.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in stating that flexible ether chains with terminal polar groups lead to low yield. The property insight regarding nonspecific interactions is valid. It considers combinations of structural features, achieving necessary complexity. Coverage is acceptable with data examples supporting the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 indicates that fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield. While the rule is clear and provides property insight about electron-withdrawing effects, it lacks sufficient coverage, as it is supported by only one data point (nonafluoropentanoic acid). This limits its reliability according to the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly links the chain length of ω-amino acids to yield, with shorter chains resulting in high yield. The property insight about chain length affecting coordination is well-articulated. The rule appropriately combines functional groups with chain length, and it has strong coverage with multiple supporting data points.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 effectively correlates aliphatic chain length in 4-substituted phenylalkanoic acids with yield, offering clarity and property insight. It balances complexity by considering both chain length and substituent position and is well-supported by data examples.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that modifiers with trifluoroacetyl groups attached to amino functions result in low yield. While clear and providing reasonable property insight, the rule is only supported by one data point, which does not meet the coverage criterion, limiting its strength.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group adjacent to two carboxylic acid groups allows for effective chelation with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) onto the chain leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, promoting effective binding. Polar substituents disrupt these interactions and may interfere with the catalyst's active sites, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance coordination with metal ions in the catalyst. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and may diminish effective coordination, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing accessible nitrogen atoms in the ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in high yield; if the nitrogen is sterically hindered or the ring is fused to another aromatic system, the yield is lower.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can act as coordination sites with metal centers, enhancing catalyst-modifier interactions. Steric hindrance or additional aromatic rings can inhibit this coordination, reducing yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids with short chains result in high yield; aromatic thiol-containing acids result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols can interact favorably with the catalyst without strongly deactivating it. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly to metal centers, causing irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enable strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains result in high yield if the side chain contains additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan); those lacking such groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Aromatic side chains without coordinating groups are less effective, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or keto groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic systems can form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains may adopt conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups can engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the effectiveness of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density on potential donor atoms, reducing coordination ability. Increased hydrophobicity may disrupt interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; longer-chain ω-amino acids result in low yield due to decreased effective coordination.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Shorter ω-amino acids maintain optimal chain length for effective interaction with the catalyst. Longer chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are 4-substituted phenylalkanoic acids with aliphatic chains of four carbons or more result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and appropriate spacing for the aromatic ring to interact effectively with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not allow optimal alignment, reducing interaction and yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl or other strongly electron-withdrawing acyl groups attached to amino functions result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, hindering its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst and decreasing yield.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been developed by analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties of the modifiers. They combine multiple substructures and functional groups to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield in the reaction.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Correct the handling of the `count_threshold` in Rule 1. The keys of the `count_threshold` dictionary are the SMARTS patterns as strings, but after compilation, the SMARTS strings may be canonicalized and not match exactly. To fix this, associate the count threshold directly with the compiled pattern objects, or ensure that the SMARTS strings used as keys are the canonical forms obtained from `pat.GetSmarts()`. This will make sure that the count thresholds are correctly matched with their corresponding patterns during the matching process.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Refine the `polar_groups` exclusion pattern in Rule 2. The current pattern `'[#7,#8,#15,#16]'` excludes any molecule containing nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, or sulfur, which unintentionally excludes all carboxylic acids due to the oxygen atoms in the carboxyl group. Modify the exclusion pattern to specifically target polar functional groups along the chain, excluding the carboxylic acid group. For example, use `'[$([#7;!$(N-C(=O))]),$([#8;!$(O=C)])]'` to exclude nitrogen and oxygen atoms not part of amide or carboxyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Adjust the logical grouping of patterns in Rule 3. The code currently lists the patterns as `[[para_substituted_benzoic_acid], [nitro_group, halogen]]`, which may not enforce the requirement that the electron-withdrawing group is para to the carboxylic acid. Modify the patterns to ensure that the electron-withdrawing group is specifically at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. For instance, use a single SMARTS pattern that captures a para-substituted benzoic acid with an electron-withdrawing group: `'c1ccc(cc1C(=O)O)[NX3](=O)=O'` for a nitro group, or parameterize the position and type of the substituent more precisely.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Review and standardize the code's logic for multiple patterns and their groupings in each rule. Ensure that the code correctly interprets the logical "AND" and "OR" between patterns within a rule. For example, if a rule requires that multiple patterns must all be present (logical "AND"), ensure that the code checks for this conjunction. If a rule allows for any one of several patterns to match (logical "OR"), ensure that the code checks for this disjunction correctly.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Implement unit tests for each rule using known example molecules that should match (positive control) and known non-matching molecules (negative control). This will help verify that the SMARTS patterns and code logic correctly implement the natural language rules. Unit tests can identify mismatches between expected and actual matches, guiding further refinement of the patterns and code.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Refine the SMARTS patterns to accurately represent the structural requirements of the natural language rules. For example, in Rule 4, ensure that the patterns for heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with accessible nitrogen atoms correctly exclude sterically hindered nitrogens and fused aromatic systems. Use SMARTS patterns that capture the specific ring systems and substitution patterns mentioned in the rules.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Use more precise atom and bond specifications in SMARTS patterns to improve the specificity of substructure searches. For instance, in Rule 5, when distinguishing between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing acids, ensure that the SMARTS patterns specify whether the sulfur atom is directly attached to an aliphatic carbon (`'C[S]C(=O)O'`) versus an aromatic carbon (`'c[S]C(=O)O'`).

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Modify the code to provide detailed feedback when patterns do not match as expected. Include logging or print statements that report which patterns were tested, which ones matched or did not match, and any reasons for mismatches (e.g., missing substructures, unexpected atoms). This diagnostic information can help troubleshoot issues with the SMARTS patterns and code logic.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

The performance of the current rules has been assessed by comparing the current rule metrics to the reference metrics from previous iterations. The focus is on the key metrics of **confidence** and **lift**, while also considering **support** and **leverage** to understand the overall effectiveness of the rules.

---

**Support Comparison:**

- **Previous Train Support:**
  - Average: Approximately 16.67% to 18.45%
- **Current Train Support:**
  - Iterations range: 1.67% to 10.23%
  - Final iteration: **2.10%**

*Comment:* There is a significant decrease in train support in the current rules compared to the previous ones. This indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller subset of the training data.

---

**Confidence Comparison:**

- **Previous Train Confidence:**
  - Average: Approximately 53.96% to 63.52%
- **Current Train Confidence:**
  - Iterations range: 64.0% to 75.0%
  - Final iteration: **64.0%**

*Comment:* The current rules show a slight increase in train confidence compared to the previous rules. Higher confidence means that when the rule conditions are met, the predictions are more often correct.

---

**Lift Comparison:**

- **Previous Train Lift:**
  - Average: Approximately 1.056 to 1.205
- **Current Train Lift:**
  - Iterations range: 1.278 to 1.496
  - Final iteration: **1.278**

*Comment:* The lift has increased in the current rules, indicating that the rules are more effective at predicting the outcome compared to random chance. A lift greater than 1 suggests a positive association between the rule conditions and the predictions.

---

**Leverage Comparison:**

- **Previous Train Leverage:**
  - Average: Approximately -0.0041 to 0.0289
- **Current Train Leverage:**
  - Iterations range: 0.0064 to 0.0188
  - Final iteration: **0.0064**

*Comment:* The leverage in the current rules is positive but lower than the highest values in the previous metrics. Positive leverage indicates a stronger association than expected by chance, but the lower values suggest the rules may involve less frequent items or have a reduced impact on the dataset.

---

**Observations and Analysis:**

1. **Trade-off Between Support and Confidence:**

   - The increase in **confidence** and **lift** comes with a decrease in **support**.
   - This suggests that the current rules are more specific, focusing on a smaller subset of data where the predictions are more accurate.
   - While higher confidence and lift are desirable, the reduced support means the rules are applicable to fewer cases, potentially limiting their usefulness.

2. **Potential Overfitting:**

   - The diminishing support and increasing confidence might indicate overfitting to the training data.
   - The rules may be capturing noise or very specific patterns that do not generalize well to unseen data.
   - Overly specific rules may not perform well on test data or in practical applications.

3. **Leverage Considerations:**

   - Lower leverage values compared to previous iterations suggest that the strength of association between the conditions and predictions has not significantly improved.
   - High leverage with high confidence and lift would indicate more robust and impactful rules.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

- **Local Minimum:**

  - The pattern of increasing confidence and lift alongside decreasing support hints that a local minimum may have been reached.
  - Further iterations aiming solely to improve confidence and lift may continue to reduce support, making the rules less generalizable.

- **Sufficiency of Iterations:**

  - Given the current trends, additional iterations may yield minimal benefits and could exacerbate overfitting.
  - It may be appropriate to conclude the iterative process focused on these metrics and shift attention to improving rule applicability and robustness.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Balance Specificity and Generality:**

   - **Generalize Rule Conditions:**
     - Relax overly strict conditions to widen the applicability of the rules.
     - For example, instead of specifying exact chain lengths or substituents, consider broader categories (e.g., "medium-length aliphatic chains" or "electron-withdrawing groups").

   - **Increase Support Without Sacrificing Confidence:**
     - Identify patterns that maintain high confidence but cover a larger portion of the data.
     - Aim for a balance where support is increased while keeping confidence and lift at acceptable levels.

2. **Simplify Complex Rules:**

   - **Reduce Complexity:**
     - Complex rules with numerous conditions may not generalize well.
     - Simplify rules to core components that have the most significant impact on yield.

   - **Merge Similar Rules:**
     - Combine rules that have overlapping conditions or similar rationales.
     - This can enhance support and streamline the rule set.

3. **Incorporate Test Data Evaluation:**

   - **Validate Rules on Test Data:**
     - Evaluate the current rules against test data to assess their generalization performance.
     - Check if the confidence and lift remain acceptable when applied to unseen data.

   - **Monitor Overfitting Indicators:**
     - Compare train and test metrics to identify discrepancies.
     - Significant drops in performance on test data suggest overfitting.

4. **Leverage Domain Knowledge:**

   - **Integrate Chemical Insights:**
     - Re-express rules using fundamental chemical principles and intuition.
     - Ensure that the rules align with known catalytic behaviors and interactions.

   - **Identify Key Functional Groups:**
     - Focus on functional groups and substructures known to have consistent effects on yield.
     - This may improve both the support and confidence of the rules.

5. **Review and Refine Specific Rules:**

   - **Example Adjustments:**

     - **Rule 1:**

       - *Current:* Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids result in high yield.
       - *Improvement:* Include analogs or derivatives of α-amino dicarboxylic acids to increase support.

     - **Rule 2:**

       - *Current:* Unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains result in high yield; introducing polar groups leads to low yield.
       - *Improvement:* Expand to include slightly shorter or longer chains if they maintain high confidence.

     - **Rule 4:**

       - *Current:* Heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with accessible nitrogen atoms result in high yield; sterically hindered nitrogen lowers yield.
       - *Improvement:* Clarify what constitutes "sterically hindered" and consider borderline cases to enhance support.

6. **Explore Alternative Metrics:**

   - **Consider Metrics Like F1 Score or ROC AUC:**
     - These metrics can provide a more nuanced view of rule performance, especially in datasets with class imbalance.
     - Balancing precision and recall might yield more practical rules.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules demonstrate higher confidence and lift compared to previous iterations, indicating better accuracy when the rule conditions are met. However, the decreased support suggests that these rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset, which may limit their practical utility.

To enhance the performance of the rules:

- Aim for a better balance between support, confidence, and lift.
- Generalize the rules appropriately to increase their applicability.
- Validate the rules on test data to ensure they generalize well.
- Leverage domain expertise to refine rules logically and chemically.

By focusing on these improvements, the rules can become more robust, widely applicable, and effective in predicting high-yield outcomes in the catalytic processes being studied.

**Performance Analysis of Current Rules Based on Latest Training Results**

The performance of the current rules can be assessed by comparing the latest training results with the reference metrics provided. 

**Comparison of Accuracy Metrics:**

- **Reference Metrics:**
  - Validation Accuracies: Predominantly around **0.76**.
  - Test Accuracies: Ranging from **0.625** to **0.75**.
- **Current Iteration Metrics:**
  - Validation Accuracies over multiple iterations:
    - Iteration 1: **0.6857**
    - Iteration 2: **0.4857**
    - Iteration 3: **0.5143**
    - Iteration 4: **0.6286**
    - Latest Iteration: **0.4857**

**Observations:**

1. **Decrease in Validation Accuracy:**
   - The current validation accuracy of **0.4857** is significantly lower than the reference validation accuracies of **0.76**.
   - This suggests that the performance of the classification model has declined with the current set of rules.

2. **Fluctuating Performance Across Iterations:**
   - The validation accuracies in the iterative process show fluctuations, indicating instability in the model's performance.
   - The accuracies range from a low of **0.4857** to a high of **0.6857**, without a clear upward trend.

3. **Potential Overfitting or Underfitting:**
   - The decrease in accuracy may suggest that the model is either **overfitting** to specific training data or **underfitting** due to overly generalized rules.
   - Inconsistent performance across iterations implies that the model has not yet converged or found an optimal set of rules.

4. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide detailed insights into the contribution of each rule to the predictions.
   - Discrepancies between predicted and experimental values highlight specific rules that may be problematic.

**Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values:**

To identify which rules are contributing to incorrect predictions, we examine molecules where the predicted loading does not match the experimental value.

1. **Overestimation Cases (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecule:** C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
     - **SHAP Values:**
       - *Rule8*: **0.0789**
       - *Rule10*: **0.0358**
       - *Rule15*: **0.0093**
     - **Analysis:**
       - *Rule8* has the highest positive SHAP value, indicating it contributes most to the overestimation.
   - **Molecule:** C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O
     - **SHAP Values:**
       - *Rule8*: **0.0789**
       - *Rule10*: **0.0358**
       - *Rule15*: **0.0093**
     - **Analysis:**
       - Again, *Rule8* significantly contributes to the overestimation.

2. **Underestimation Cases (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - **Molecule:** C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O
     - **SHAP Values:**
       - *Rule8*: **-0.1566**
       - *Rule3*: **0.0**
       - *Rule10*: **0.0204**
     - **Analysis:**
       - *Rule8* has a high negative SHAP value, indicating it contributes most to the underestimation.
   - **Molecule:** C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O
     - **SHAP Values:**
       - *Rule11*: **-0.0201**
       - *Rule3*: **-0.0171**
       - *Rule8*: **0.0535**
     - **Analysis:**
       - *Rule11* has the most negative SHAP value, contributing to the underestimation.

**Assessment of Specific Rules:**

- **Rule 8:** Modifiers with aldehyde or keto groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield.
  - *Issue Identified:* High positive SHAP values in overestimated cases and high negative SHAP values in underestimated cases suggest that Rule 8 may be overly penalizing certain structures and misclassifying modifiers.

- **Rule 3:** Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups result in low yield.
  - *Issue Identified:* Negative SHAP values in some underestimated cases indicate that Rule 3 may not be adequately capturing the influence of certain substituents.

- **Rule 11:** Modifiers that are ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; longer chains result in low yield.
  - *Issue Identified:* Negative SHAP values in underestimations suggest that Rule 11 might be too restrictive or not accounting for exceptions.

**Determination of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

- Based on the fluctuating accuracies and the absence of improvement across iterations, it appears that the model has not yet reached a local minimum.
- The inconsistencies suggest that further refinement of the rules is necessary.
- Additional iterations focusing on adjusting problematic rules may help in moving out of the current suboptimal performance.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the performance of the model, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values in Overestimations:**

   - **Rule 8 Adjustments:**
     - *Issue:* Rule 8 is contributing to high SHAP values in overestimations and high negative values in underestimations.
     - *Suggestion:*
       - Re-express Rule 8 to better discriminate between modifiers with aldehyde or keto groups that actually lead to low yield versus those that do not interfere with catalyst activity.
       - Consider incorporating exceptions for certain functional groups or structural contexts where carbonyl groups do not cause catalyst deactivation.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations:**

   - **Rule 11 Adjustments:**
     - *Issue:* Rule 11 is causing underestimations in some cases due to high negative SHAP values.
     - *Suggestion:*
       - Modify Rule 11 to account for the possibility that longer-chain ω-amino acids can also result in high yield if other favorable structural features are present.
       - Introduce a conditional clause or a new rule that captures these exceptions.

   - **Rule 3 Enhancements:**
     - *Issue:* Rule 3 may not fully capture the complexity of substituent effects on the aromatic ring.
     - *Suggestion:*
       - Expand Rule 3 to include a more nuanced view of substituent effects, considering both electronic and steric factors.
       - Utilize Hammett constants or other quantitative descriptors to refine the classification of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups.

3. **Improve Generalization to Address Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   - **Rule Complexity Balance:**
     - Ensure that rules are neither too simplistic (leading to underfitting) nor too tailored to specific cases (leading to overfitting).
     - Consider introducing sub-rules or hierarchical rules to capture more complexity without overcomplicating the model.

   - **Incorporate Additional Data:**
     - If available, incorporate more data points to enhance the training set diversity.
     - This can help the model learn from a broader range of examples and improve generalization.

4. **Use Insights from SHAP Analysis to Refine Rules:**

   - **Analyze SHAP Value Patterns:**
     - Look for patterns in the SHAP values across multiple molecules to identify systemic issues with certain rules.
     - For example, if a rule consistently has high positive SHAP values in overestimated cases, it may be overly influential.

   - **Iterative Refinement:**
     - Adjust the problematic rules identified, then re-evaluate the model's performance.
     - Use the new SHAP analysis to see if the adjustments have mitigated the issues.

5. **Consider Adding New Rules or Modifying Existing Ones:**

   - **Introduce Rule Exceptions:**
     - For rules that have known exceptions, explicitly state these exceptions to prevent misclassification.
     - Example: Modify Rule 8 to exclude certain aromatic aldehydes that do not deactivate the catalyst.

   - **Combine Rules for Better Predictive Power:**
     - Create composite rules that consider multiple structural features simultaneously.
     - This can help capture synergistic effects that individual rules may miss.

6. **Regularize Rule Contributions:**

   - **Weight Adjustment:**
     - Adjust the weights or importance of rules based on their SHAP contributions to reduce the impact of overly dominant rules.
     - This can prevent any single rule from disproportionately influencing the predictions.

7. **Validate Adjusted Rules with Cross-Validation:**

   - **Perform Cross-Validation:**
     - Use k-fold cross-validation to assess the stability and robustness of the adjusted rules.
     - This will provide a more reliable measure of the model's generalizability.

8. **Feedback Loop Incorporation:**

   - **Iterative Feedback:**
     - Continuously incorporate feedback from the SHAP analysis into the rule refinement process.
     - Establish a feedback loop where each iteration informs the next set of adjustments.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules shows diminished performance compared to the reference metrics, indicating that further refinement is necessary. By focusing on adjusting rules that contribute to misclassifications, such as Rule 8, Rule 11, and Rule 3, and by improving the generalization of the model, it is possible to enhance the predictive accuracy. Utilizing insights from the SHAP analysis in an iterative manner will be key to refining the rules effectively. Additional iterations, incorporating the suggested adjustments, are recommended to achieve a model that reliably predicts catalyst performance.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current set of rules aims to predict the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on the structure of molecular modifiers. Upon analyzing the performance metrics and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values from the latest iterations, several key observations and issues have been identified:

1. **Decreased Model Performance**: The validation accuracy has decreased from approximately 76% in previous iterations to around 48-68% in current iterations. This suggests that the current rules are not performing optimally and may not generalize well to new data.

2. **Low Support with High Confidence and Lift**: The current rules have higher confidence and lift but significantly lower support compared to previous iterations. This indicates the rules are more specific, applying to a smaller subset of data, which may limit their practical utility and suggest potential overfitting.

3. **SHAP Analysis Identifying Problematic Rules**: The SHAP analysis has highlighted that certain rules contribute disproportionately to incorrect predictions:
   - **Rule 8**: Often contributes to both overestimations and underestimations, indicating it may not accurately capture the intended chemical interactions.
   - **Rule 3**: Negative SHAP values in some underestimations suggest it may not fully account for the effects of various substituents on aromatic rings.
   - **Rule 11**: High negative SHAP values in some cases imply that the rule may be too restrictive or not account for exceptions.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Refine Specific Rules Based on Chemical Insights and SHAP Analysis**:

   - **Rule 8 (Modifiers with Aldehyde or Keto Groups)**:
     - *Issue*: Overly broad application leading to misclassification.
     - *Improvement*:
       - **Adjust the Rule Scope**: Specify that only certain aldehyde or keto groups, particularly those prone to catalyst deactivation, lead to low yield.
       - **Include Exceptions**: Acknowledge that not all carbonyl-containing modifiers adversely affect the catalyst and adjust the rule to reflect this.

   - **Rule 11 (ω-Amino Acids with Chain Length Considerations)**:
     - *Issue*: Too restrictive, not accounting for longer-chain amino acids that may still result in high yield.
     - *Improvement*:
       - **Broaden the Chain Length Criteria**: Allow for longer-chain ω-amino acids if they possess other favorable features that enhance catalyst interaction.
       - **Incorporate Additional Structural Factors**: Consider the effect of branching, presence of additional functional groups, or rigidity of the chain.

   - **Rule 3 (Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups)**:
     - *Issue*: Insufficiently precise in capturing the influence of substituents.
     - *Improvement*:
       - **Refine Substituent Classification**: Use electronic parameters like Hammett sigma constants to quantify electron-withdrawing or donating effects.
       - **Specify Position Explicitly**: Ensure that the substituent's position relative to the carboxylic acid is clearly defined in the rule.
       - **Consider Steric Effects**: Account for steric hindrance that might affect the accessibility of the carboxyl group for coordination.

2. **Enhance SMARTS Patterns for Accurate Substructure Matching**:

   - **Correct Handling of `count_threshold`**:
     - *Issue*: Mismatch between SMARTS patterns and their associated count thresholds due to canonicalization.
     - *Improvement*:
       - **Associate Thresholds with Compiled Patterns**: Ensure that each count threshold is directly linked to its corresponding compiled SMARTS pattern object.

   - **Refine Exclusion Patterns in Rule 2**:
     - *Issue*: Over-exclusion due to broad patterns that unintentionally exclude carboxylic acids.
     - *Improvement*:
       - **Use More Specific SMARTS**: Modify patterns to exclude only undesired polar groups along the chain, not those in functional groups like carboxylic acids.

   - **Adjust Logical Groupings in Rule 3**:
     - *Issue*: Possible misinterpretation of logical "AND" and "OR" between patterns.
     - *Improvement*:
       - **Clarify Logical Operations**: Define whether multiple patterns should be matched simultaneously or if any one is sufficient.
       - **Combine Patterns Where Appropriate**: Use composite SMARTS patterns to capture complex substructures in a single expression.

3. **Standardize and Simplify Rule Logic**:

   - **Ensure Consistent Logic Across Rules**:
     - *Improvement*:
       - **Use Clear Logical Structures**: Adopt a consistent approach to combining patterns within rules, clearly defining conjunctions and disjunctions.
       - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: Focus on key functional groups or structural features that have the most significant impact on yield.

4. **Implement Unit Tests for Rule Verification**:

   - **Test Rules Against Known Examples**:
     - *Improvement*:
       - **Positive Controls**: Ensure that molecules known to produce high yield match the rules intended to capture them.
       - **Negative Controls**: Verify that molecules known to produce low yield do not incorrectly match high-yield rules.
       - **Iteratively Refine Rules**: Use the results of these tests to adjust SMARTS patterns and rule logic.

5. **Increase Rule Applicability Without Sacrificing Accuracy**:

   - **Balance Specificity and Generality**:
     - *Improvement*:
       - **Generalize Where Possible**: Broaden rules to cover more molecules while maintaining high confidence and lift.
       - **Avoid Overfitting**: Ensure rules are not tailored too closely to the training data by validating them on separate test sets.

6. **Incorporate Additional Chemical Knowledge**:

   - **Leverage Domain Expertise**:
     - *Improvement*:
       - **Consult Literature**: Integrate findings from relevant studies on catalyst-modifier interactions into the rule development.
       - **Consider Mechanistic Insights**: Factor in the underlying reaction mechanisms and how different functional groups might influence them.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Yes, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current issues stem from rules that are either too restrictive or not accurately capturing the structural features that influence yield. By refining the rules based on chemical principles, adjusting SMARTS patterns for precise matching, and validating the rules with unit tests and cross-validation, we can improve the model's performance and generalizability.

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group adjacent to two carboxylic acid groups allows for effective chelation with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) onto the chain leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, promoting effective binding. Polar substituents disrupt these interactions and may interfere with the catalyst's active sites, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance coordination with metal ions in the catalyst. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and may diminish effective coordination, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing accessible nitrogen atoms in the ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in high yield; if the nitrogen is sterically hindered or the ring is fused to another aromatic system, the yield is lower.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can act as coordination sites with metal centers, enhancing catalyst-modifier interactions. Steric hindrance or additional aromatic rings can inhibit this coordination, reducing yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids with short chains result in high yield; aromatic thiol-containing acids result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols can interact favorably with the catalyst without strongly deactivating it. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly to metal centers, causing irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enable strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains result in high yield if the side chain contains additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan); those lacking such groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Aromatic side chains without coordinating groups are less effective, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or keto groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic systems can form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether chains and terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains may adopt conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups can engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the effectiveness of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density on potential donor atoms, reducing coordination ability. Increased hydrophobicity may disrupt interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; longer-chain ω-amino acids result in low yield due to decreased effective coordination.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Shorter ω-amino acids maintain optimal chain length for effective interaction with the catalyst. Longer chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are 4-substituted phenylalkanoic acids with aliphatic chains of four carbons or more result in high yield; similar structures with shorter chains result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and appropriate spacing for the aromatic ring to interact effectively with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not allow optimal alignment, reducing interaction and yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl or other strongly electron-withdrawing acyl groups attached to amino functions result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, hindering its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst and decreasing yield.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 8 to Enhance Specificity and Accuracy**

  - **Action**: Adjust Rule 8 to more precisely identify modifiers that cause low yield due to aldehyde or keto groups that deactivate the catalyst, avoiding overgeneralization.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Modify the SMARTS Pattern**: Revise the SMARTS pattern to specifically target aldehyde or keto groups directly attached to aromatic rings that are known to interfere with the catalyst's active site.
    - **Exclude Non-Deactivating Carbonyl Groups**: Ensure the rule does not capture modifiers where aldehyde or keto groups are positioned in a way that doesn't affect the catalyst.
    - **Add Exceptions**: Include clauses to prevent the rule from misclassifying modifiers that contain carbonyl groups but do not lead to catalyst deactivation.
  - **Example**:
    - Update the SMARTS pattern to: `[$([#6]=[O]),$([#6]=[O])]C1=CC=CC=C1` which specifically captures aldehyde or keto groups attached to benzene rings.
  - **Rationale**: By refining the pattern, the rule will more accurately predict low-yield modifiers without falsely excluding high-yield ones.

- **Advice 2**: **Broaden Rule 11 to Account for Longer ω-Amino Acids**

  - **Action**: Expand Rule 11 to include longer-chain ω-amino acids that may still result in high yield due to additional favorable interactions.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Adjust Chain Length Criterion**: Increase the allowable chain length for ω-amino acids beyond five carbons if they possess other coordinating functional groups.
    - **Incorporate Additional Structural Features**: Consider incorporating branching, multiple amino groups, or presence of hydroxyl groups that enhance coordination.
    - **Revise SMARTS Pattern**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to detect these additional features.
  - **Example**:
    - Change the rule to: "Modifiers that are ω-amino acids with chain lengths of up to seven carbons, especially if they contain additional amino or hydroxyl groups, result in high yield."
    - Update the SMARTS pattern accordingly.
  - **Rationale**: Including modifiers with beneficial structural features prevents the rule from being overly restrictive and improves prediction accuracy.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rule 3 to Better Capture Electronic Effects**

  - **Action**: Enhance Rule 3 by quantitatively classifying substituents based on their electron-withdrawing or donating effects and specifying their positions.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Use Hammett Sigma Constants**: Classify substituents using their sigma values to more accurately distinguish between electron-withdrawing and donating groups.
    - **Specify Substituent Position**: Ensure the rule clearly defines substituents at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.
    - **Consider Steric Hindrance**: Account for the impact of bulky substituents on coordination with the catalyst.
    - **Update SMARTS Pattern**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to reflect these refinements.
  - **Example**:
    - Revise the rule to: "Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (σ_p > +0.45) result in high yield."
    - Modify the SMARTS pattern to incorporate specific substituents with known sigma values.
  - **Rationale**: These refinements will improve the rule's ability to distinguish between high and low-yield modifiers based on electronic properties.

- **Advice 4**: **Correct Handling of `count_threshold` in SMARTS Patterns**

  - **Action**: Ensure each SMARTS pattern is correctly associated with its `count_threshold` to prevent mismatches and misclassifications.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Link Thresholds to Patterns**: In the code, directly associate each `count_threshold` with its corresponding compiled SMARTS pattern object.
    - **Review Code Logic**: Check for issues in the code that might cause thresholds to be applied incorrectly due to canonicalization or pattern compilation.
  - **Rationale**: Proper threshold handling is crucial for accurate pattern matching and rule application.

- **Advice 5**: **Refine Exclusion Patterns in Rule 2 to Prevent Over-Exclusion**

  - **Action**: Adjust the exclusion patterns in Rule 2 to specifically exclude unwanted polar groups without affecting necessary functional groups like carboxylic acids.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Specify Undesired Groups**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to exclude only modifiers with hydroxyl or amino groups along the hydrocarbon chain, not terminal groups.
    - **Use Negative Lookahead Patterns**: Implement SMARTS that exclude specific internal functionalities while allowing terminal carboxylic acids.
  - **Example**:
    - Update the pattern to exclude molecules with `[*][CX4][OX2H]` (internal hydroxyls) or `[*][CX4][NH2]` (internal amino groups).
  - **Rationale**: This prevents the unintentional exclusion of high-yield modifiers and improves the specificity of the rule.

- **Advice 6**: **Standardize Logical Operations and Simplify Rule Complexity**

  - **Action**: Review and align the logical structures across all rules, simplifying overly complex rules where possible.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Explicit Logical Operators**: Clearly define whether conditions within a rule are connected by "AND" or "OR".
    - **Simplify Conditions**: Focus on the most impactful structural features and remove unnecessary complexity.
    - **Update Code Implementation**: Ensure the logical structure in the code matches the intended rule logic.
  - **Rationale**: Consistency and clarity in rule logic reduce errors and improve rule effectiveness.

- **Advice 7**: **Implement Unit Tests for Rule Verification and Refinement**

  - **Action**: Develop and run unit tests to validate each rule against known examples, refining the rules based on the results.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Create Test Cases**: Assemble a set of high-yield and low-yield modifiers as positive and negative controls.
    - **Test Rule Matches**: Check that each rule correctly identifies the appropriate modifiers.
    - **Iterative Refinement**: Adjust the rules and SMARTS patterns based on test outcomes to improve accuracy.
  - **Rationale**: Unit testing ensures the rules function as intended and provides a systematic approach to refinement.

- **Advice 8**: **Broaden Rule Applicability While Maintaining Accuracy**

  - **Action**: Generalize rules where appropriate to increase their applicability without compromising precision.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Focus on Key Functional Groups**: Identify the most influential features common to high-yield modifiers.
    - **Avoid Overfitting**: Ensure the rules are not overly tailored to the current dataset by validating with new data.
    - **Test Generalized Rules**: Use external datasets or cross-validation to confirm the broader applicability.
  - **Rationale**: Broader rules enhance the utility of the model in predicting yields for novel modifiers.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Mechanistic Insights and Chemical Knowledge**

  - **Action**: Use chemical literature and understanding of reaction mechanisms to inform and improve the rules.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Consult Research Findings**: Integrate insights from studies on similar reactions and catalyst interactions.
    - **Mechanism-Based Adjustments**: Modify rules to reflect how different functional groups affect the catalyst and reaction pathway.
    - **Update Rules Accordingly**: Incorporate this knowledge into the rules to enhance their scientific validity.
  - **Rationale**: Grounding rules in established chemical principles improves their reliability and predictive power.

**End of Advice**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) onto the chain leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, promoting effective binding. Polar substituents disrupt these interactions and may interfere with the catalyst's active sites, resulting in lower yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield due to effective chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group adjacent to two carboxylic acid groups allows for strong chelation with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance coordination with metal ions in the catalyst. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and may diminish effective coordination, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metals (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in high yield; if the nitrogen is sterically hindered or conjugated with additional aromatic rings, the yield is lower.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as coordination sites with metal centers, enhancing catalyst-modifier interactions. Steric hindrance or additional conjugation can inhibit this coordination, reducing yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) result in high yield; those lacking such groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Side chains without coordinating groups are less effective, leading to lower yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enable strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex and improving yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or keto groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic systems can form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; longer-chain ω-amino acids result in low yield due to decreased effective coordination with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Shorter ω-amino acids maintain optimal chain length for effective interaction with the catalyst. Longer chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether chains with terminal polar groups result in low yield due to nonspecific interactions that hinder effective catalyst binding.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains may adopt conformations that prevent proper orientation and binding to the catalyst. Terminal polar groups can engage in nonspecific interactions, reducing the effectiveness of catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity that hinder catalyst interaction.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density on potential donor atoms, reducing coordination ability. Increased hydrophobicity may disrupt interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids with short chains result in high yield; aromatic thiol-containing acids result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols can interact favorably with the catalyst without strongly deactivating it. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly to metal centers, causing irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are substituted phenylalkanoic acids with appropriate chain lengths and functional groups capable of coordinating with the catalyst result in high yield; inadequate chain length or lack of coordinating groups leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: An optimal aliphatic chain length allows the functional groups to interact effectively with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide sufficient flexibility or spacing for effective coordination, reducing yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing acylated amino groups with strong electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., trifluoroacetyl) result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, hindering its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst and decreasing yield.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with conjugated systems that include electron-withdrawing groups capable of chelation result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Conjugated systems with electron-withdrawing groups can coordinate with the metal center, stabilizing the complex and enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing sulfur in functional groups show variable yields depending on their structure; simple aliphatic sulfhydryl groups may lead to high yield, whereas more complex sulfur functionalities or those in aromatic systems may lead to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: The nature and position of the sulfur-containing group impact its ability to interact with the catalyst. Simple aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively, while aromatic thiols or complex sulfur functionalities may bind too strongly or inefficiently, reducing catalytic activity.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Reformulate the Rules Using Quantitative Molecular Descriptors**

  Transform qualitative descriptions in the current rules into quantitative molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. This will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix for modeling and improve the precision of the rules.

- **Advice 2**: **Define Specific Descriptor Thresholds for Each Rule**

  For each rule, identify key molecular features and set numerical thresholds. For example:

  - **Rule 1**: Specify aliphatic chain length explicitly (e.g., chain length between 6 and 8 carbons).
  - **Rule 3**: Quantify electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects using Hammett sigma constants or calculated partial charges.

- **Advice 3**: **Utilize Standardized Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints**

  Employ standardized molecular descriptors such as:

  - **Physicochemical Properties**: Molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA).
  - **Functional Group Counts**: Number of carboxylic acids, hydroxyl groups, amino groups, etc.
  - **Structural Alerts**: Presence of specific substructures identified by SMARTS patterns.

  These descriptors can be automatically calculated from SMILES strings using cheminformatics toolkits.

- **Advice 4**: **Convert Structural Features into Numerical Features**

  Translate complex structural features into numerical indicators. For instance:

  - **Branching Index**: Calculate the number of branch points in the aliphatic chain.
  - **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**: Count the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.
  - **Aromaticity**: Indicator variable for the presence of aromatic rings.

- **Advice 5**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**

  Reduce complexity by merging rules with similar features and eliminating redundant ones. Focus on the most impactful descriptors to create a concise set of rules.

- **Advice 6**: **Provide Clear Computational Criteria for High vs. Low Yield**

  Establish clear numerical criteria to distinguish between high and low yield modifiers. For example:

  - **High Yield**: Modifiers with LogP > 2, chain length between 5 and 8 carbons, and zero polar functional groups.
  - **Low Yield**: Modifiers with TPSA > 80 Å² or containing specific functional groups that correlate with low yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Integrate Machine Learning for Descriptor Selection**

  Use machine learning techniques to analyze the dataset and identify the most significant descriptors influencing yield. This data-driven approach can reveal correlations not immediately apparent from chemical intuition.

- **Advice 8**: **Re-express Rules with Descriptor-Based Rationale**

  Rewrite the rules using the identified descriptors. For example:

  - **Revised Rule 1**: Modifiers with an unbranched aliphatic chain length of 6–8 carbons (6 ≤ chain length ≤ 8), zero branching points, and LogP between 2 and 5 result in high yield. Introducing polar functional groups (hydrophilic surface area > X Å²) leads to low yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Create a Descriptor Table for Modifiers**

  Construct a table listing each modifier alongside its calculated descriptors and observed yield. This will assist in validating the new rules and in training predictive models.

- **Advice 10**: **Develop SMARTS Patterns for Key Functional Groups**

  Define SMARTS patterns to identify structural motifs associated with high or low yield. For example:

  - **High Yield Patterns**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with specific chain lengths, heteroaromatic rings with coordinating nitrogen atoms.
  - **Low Yield Patterns**: Modifiers containing aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings, long-chain ω-amino acids.

- **Advice 11**: **Incorporate Electronic Effects Quantitatively**

  Quantify electronic effects using parameters like:

  - **Hammett Sigma Constants**: For substituents on aromatic rings.
  - **Mulliken or Natural Population Analysis Charges**: For atoms involved in coordination.

- **Advice 12**: **Validate Revised Rules Against the Dataset**

  Test the new descriptor-based rules on the existing dataset to ensure they accurately predict high and low yield outcomes. Adjust thresholds as necessary based on this validation.

- **Advice 13**: **Document Assumptions and Limitations**

  Clearly state any assumptions made in the descriptor calculations and acknowledge limitations, such as the potential for exceptions or the influence of steric factors not captured by simple descriptors.

- **Advice 14**: **Provide Examples of Descriptor Calculations**

  Include example calculations for specific modifiers to illustrate how descriptors are derived from SMILES strings and used to predict yield.

- **Advice 15**: **Establish a Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement**

  Use experimental results from new modifiers to refine the rules and descriptors continually. This iterative approach will enhance the predictive power of the model over time.

Rule Generator Message:
After analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties, here are the updated rules that describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the yield:

---

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (amino acids with a side-chain carboxylic acid group) result in high yield due to effective chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with metal centers in the catalyst, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The hydrophobic aliphatic chain facilitates interactions with the catalyst's hydrophobic regions, promoting effective binding.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with metal ions in the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, reducing coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing coordinating nitrogen atoms result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings serve as additional coordination sites with the metal catalyst, enhancing modifier-catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Rationale*: The heteroatom in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal catalyst, strengthening the interaction and improving yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enable strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the complex.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic ω-amino acids with a chain length of five carbons result in high yield; longer chain lengths result in low yield due to decreased effective coordination.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: A chain length of five carbons optimizes the spatial arrangement for coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains result in low yield due to reduced effective interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt conformations that hinder proper orientation and binding to the catalyst, diminishing catalytic effectiveness.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing aldehyde groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing efficiency.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density on potential donor atoms, hindering coordination with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic thiols may bind strongly to metal centers, leading to irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are substituted phenylalkanoic acids with a chain length of at least five carbons and containing additional coordinating groups result in high yield; inadequate chain length or lack of coordinating groups leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Sufficient aliphatic chain length allows the coordinating groups to effectively interact with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide adequate spacing for coordination.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups bearing strong electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., trifluoroacetyl) result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, impairing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic systems capable of chelation result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic structures provide additional coordination sites, strengthening the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yield due to weaker interactions with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: Absence of coordinating functional groups in the side chain leads to reduced binding affinity with the catalyst, lowering the yield.

Current rules:
After analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties, here are the updated rules that describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the yield:

---

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (amino acids with a side-chain carboxylic acid group) result in high yield due to effective chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with metal centers in the catalyst, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The hydrophobic aliphatic chain facilitates interactions with the catalyst's hydrophobic regions, promoting effective binding.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with metal ions in the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, reducing coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing coordinating nitrogen atoms result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings serve as additional coordination sites with the metal catalyst, enhancing modifier-catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Rationale*: The heteroatom in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal catalyst, strengthening the interaction and improving yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enable strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the complex.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic ω-amino acids with a chain length of five carbons result in high yield; longer chain lengths result in low yield due to decreased effective coordination.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: A chain length of five carbons optimizes the spatial arrangement for coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains result in low yield due to reduced effective interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt conformations that hinder proper orientation and binding to the catalyst, diminishing catalytic effectiveness.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing aldehyde groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing efficiency.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density on potential donor atoms, hindering coordination with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic thiols may bind strongly to metal centers, leading to irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are substituted phenylalkanoic acids with a chain length of at least five carbons and containing additional coordinating groups result in high yield; inadequate chain length or lack of coordinating groups leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Sufficient aliphatic chain length allows the coordinating groups to effectively interact with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide adequate spacing for coordination.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups bearing strong electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., trifluoroacetyl) result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, impairing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic systems capable of chelation result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic structures provide additional coordination sites, strengthening the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yield due to weaker interactions with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: Absence of coordinating functional groups in the side chain leads to reduced binding affinity with the catalyst, lowering the yield.

**End of Rules**

These rules combine multiple substructures and functional groups to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield in the reaction. They cover a broad range of the dataset and balance simplicity with complexity, providing effective guidance for future modifier design.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: *Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 to be less rigid and more inclusive.* The current SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 may be too specific and fail to match relevant amino acids due to protonation states, stereochemistry, or slight variations in structure. Modify the SMARTS to include different protonation states and allow for stereochemistry variations. For example, use `'[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[#6][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` to match both protonated and deprotonated forms and different stereoisomers of α-amino dicarboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 2**: *Improve the chain length calculation in the custom function for Rule 2.* The `get_chain_length` function may not accurately identify unbranched aliphatic chains or may incorrectly handle branching points. Modify the function to strictly traverse linear carbon chains and accurately count carbon atoms, ensuring that branching points terminate the chain length calculation.

- **Suggestion 3**: *Expand the SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups in Rule 3.* The current patterns may not capture all relevant substituents at the para position. Include additional electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., cyano, sulfonyl) and electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy, amino) in the SMARTS patterns to better reflect the rule's intent. For example, for EWG: `'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H])cc([N+](=O)[O-],C#N,S(=O)(=O)[OX1H])c1'`; for EDG: `'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H])cc([OX2H, NX3H2, OC, NC])c1'`.

- **Suggestion 4**: *Generalize the SMARTS pattern for heteroaromatic carboxylic acids in Rule 4.* The current pattern may only match specific heteroaromatic rings. Expand the SMARTS to include various heteroaromatic systems containing nitrogen that can coordinate with metal catalysts. For example, use a pattern like `'[c,n]1[c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n]1[C](=O)[O][H]'` to match different heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms.

- **Suggestion 5**: *Refine the pattern for multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups in Rule 6.* The existing pattern may not match sugars or polyhydroxylated chains correctly due to stereochemistry or ring structures. Use a more flexible pattern that accounts for stereochemistry and ring systems, such as `'[CX4H2,O][CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H2]'`, and consider using recursive SMARTS or multiple patterns to capture both linear and cyclic polyhydroxylated structures.

- **Suggestion 6**: *Correct the chain length and branching detection in Rule 7's custom function.* Ensure that the function accurately counts the number of carbon atoms between the amino group and the carboxylic acid, and that it properly identifies branching points. It may be necessary to implement depth-first search (DFS) with backtracking to accurately measure the chain length and detect branching.

- **Suggestion 7**: *Add informative logging or debugging statements to the code.* Include print statements or use a logging library to output which molecules match each rule, the substructures found, and any reasons why a molecule may not match. This can help identify issues in pattern matching and function logic.

- **Suggestion 8**: *Consider protonation states and tautomeric forms in the molecule preprocessing step.* Some rules may fail to match due to protonation states or tautomerism not being considered. Use RDKit's `EnumerateTautomers()` function or normalize protonation states before applying the rules to ensure all relevant forms are considered.

- **Suggestion 9**: *Verify the handling of stereochemistry in SMARTS patterns and molecule matching.* Ensure that chiral centers and stereoisomers are properly accounted for in the SMARTS patterns and during substructure searches, perhaps by setting `useChirality=False` in substructure matching functions if stereochemistry is not critical for the rule.

- **Suggestion 10**: *Validate the code with known examples to ensure rules match as expected.* Use a test set of SMILES strings for which the expected rule matches are known (e.g., the high-yield examples provided in each rule) to verify that the code correctly identifies matches. If discrepancies are found, adjust the SMARTS patterns or functions accordingly.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**Summary of Current Metrics:**

- **Train Support:** 0.0
- **Train Confidence:** 0.5
- **Train Lift:** 1.0
- **Train Leverage:** 0.0

**Comparison with Previous Metrics:**

1. **Train Support:**
   - **Previous Metrics:** Average support ranged from approximately 0.0167 to 0.1023.
   - **Current Metric:** 0.0
   - **Interpretation:** The current rules have **zero support**, meaning they do not apply to any instances in the training dataset. This indicates that none of the data points satisfy the rule conditions and predictions simultaneously.

2. **Train Confidence:**
   - **Previous Metrics:** Confidence values ranged from approximately 0.64 to 0.75.
   - **Current Metric:** 0.5
   - **Interpretation:** The confidence has **decreased** compared to previous iterations. A confidence of 0.5 suggests that when the rule conditions are met (which is never, given zero support), there's a 50% chance of the prediction being correct, but this is not meaningful without applicable instances.

3. **Train Lift:**
   - **Previous Metrics:** Lift values ranged from approximately 1.278 to 1.496.
   - **Current Metric:** 1.0
   - **Interpretation:** The lift has decreased to **1.0**, indicating that the rule's predictive power is equivalent to random chance. A lift of 1 implies no association between the rule conditions and the outcome.

4. **Train Leverage:**
   - **Previous Metrics:** Leverage values ranged from approximately 0.0064 to 0.0188.
   - **Current Metric:** 0.0
   - **Interpretation:** A leverage of 0.0 means there is no difference between the observed rule support and the expected support if the rule conditions and predictions were independent. Thus, the rule provides no additional information over random chance.

---

**Assessment:**

- The **zero support** is particularly concerning. It suggests that the current set of rules does not cover any instances in the dataset. This could be due to the rules being overly specific, too restrictive, or perhaps not aligned with the underlying data patterns.
- The **confidence** value is not meaningful in this context because it is calculated based on instances where the rule applies, and with zero support, there are no such instances.
- The **lift** of 1.0 and **leverage** of 0.0 confirm that the rules currently have no predictive power beyond what would be expected by chance.

**Comparison with Previous Iterations:**

- In previous iterations, the rules had **positive support**, **higher confidence**, and **lift greater than 1**, indicating they were capturing some meaningful relationships within the data.
- The **decline in performance** suggests that the current iteration may have either overfitted the rules (making them too specific) or introduced rules that do not align well with the data.

---

**Local Minimum and Iterations:**

- Given the **decline in performance**, it's possible that the process has reached a **local minimum**. This means that without changing the approach, further iterations may not lead to significant improvements.
- The fact that performance metrics are **worse than in previous iterations** indicates that adjustments are necessary.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules:**

1. **Re-evaluate Rule Specificity:**
   - **Issue:** The rules may be too specific, causing zero support.
   - **Solution:** Broaden the rule conditions to encompass more data instances. This can be done by relaxing certain constraints or combining similar rules.

2. **Increase Rule Support:**
   - **Issue:** Zero support indicates the rules are not matching any data points.
   - **Solution:** Analyze the dataset to identify common patterns and adjust the rules accordingly. Ensure that the rules are applicable to a reasonable portion of the data.

3. **Enhance Predictive Power:**
   - **Issue:** Lift of 1.0 indicates no predictive advantage.
   - **Solution:** Focus on identifying conditions that not only occur frequently (support) but also are strong predictors of the outcome (confidence and lift). Consider statistical methods or machine learning techniques to uncover these relationships.

4. **Simplify Rules:**
   - **Issue:** Complexity may be hindering the effectiveness of the rules.
   - **Solution:** Simplify the rules to make them more general while still capturing key predictive features. Remove redundant or overlapping rules.

5. **Validate with Cross-Validation:**
   - **Issue:** Overfitting to the training data can lead to poor performance on unseen data.
   - **Solution:** Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules generalize well to different subsets of the data.

6. **Incorporate Domain Expertise:**
   - **Issue:** Rules may not fully reflect the chemical principles governing the reaction yields.
   - **Solution:** Collaborate with domain experts to refine the rules based on known chemical behaviors and mechanisms, ensuring that they are both scientifically sound and data-driven.

7. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - **Issue:** The current iteration may have strayed from effective patterns.
   - **Solution:** Review previous iterations where the metrics were better. Analyze which rules contributed positively and consider reintroducing or adjusting them.

8. **Analyze Feature Importance:**
   - **Issue:** Not all features may be equally significant.
   - **Solution:** Use statistical analysis to determine which molecular features are most strongly associated with high yields and prioritize them in the rules.

---

**Specific Suggestions Based on the Current Rules:**

- **Rule Coverage:** Evaluate each rule to determine how many instances it applies to. Rules that apply to zero instances need to be modified or removed.
- **Overlap and Contradictions:** Check for rules that may contradict each other or overlap significantly, causing confusion in the predictive model.
- **Functional Group Emphasis:** Consider focusing on functional groups and molecular properties that have consistently shown strong associations with yield in the data.
- **Rule Examples and Exceptions:** Re-examine the examples provided for each rule. Ensure that they align with the data and consider any exceptions that might affect the rule's applicability.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current rules are not performing effectively, as evidenced by the metrics. To improve, it is crucial to:

- **Broaden the applicability** of the rules to increase support.
- **Enhance the predictive power** by focusing on conditions that significantly influence the outcome.
- **Simplify and adjust** the rules based on data patterns and chemical knowledge.
- **Iterate and validate** the rules using robust statistical methods to avoid local minima and ensure generalizability.

By implementing these strategies, the rules can be refined to improve their performance metrics, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions of reaction yields.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

The current rules appear to be less effective than in previous iterations. The validation accuracy has decreased to **51.43%**, compared to previous accuracies of **76%**. This significant drop indicates that the current rules are not capturing the essential features necessary for accurate predictions.

**2. Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**

Given the lower accuracy and the minimal variation in SHAP values (especially with Rule 6 having zero SHAP values across all molecules), it suggests that the model is **underfitting**. The rules may be too simplistic or not adequately representative of the underlying relationships in the data. This means the model cannot capture the complexity needed to make accurate predictions on both training and validation sets.

**3. Analysis of Discrepancies:**

The SHAP analysis shows that **Rule 6 has zero SHAP value for all molecules**, indicating it has no impact on the model's predictions. Additionally, other rules are not appearing in the SHAP analysis, suggesting they are not being considered in the model. This absence makes it challenging to identify which rules are contributing to incorrect predictions, as there's no differential contribution from the rules.

**4. Interpret Accuracy Improvements:**

The decreased accuracy suggests that the current rules have **not improved** the model's performance. Instead, the model's predictive capability has deteriorated compared to previous iterations. The probability of improvement with the current set of rules seems low unless significant adjustments are made.

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

The SHAP analysis indicates that the **rules are not contributing meaningfully** to the model's predictions. Specifically:

- **Zero SHAP Values**: Rule 6 having zero SHAP values across all data points suggests it doesn't influence the outcome. This could be due to improper implementation or because the rule doesn't apply to any molecules in the dataset.
- **Missing Rules**: The absence of other rules in the SHAP analysis implies they are either not being applied correctly or not encoded in the feature matrix.

**Performance Summary:**

- **Current Validation Accuracy**: 51.43%
- **Previous Validation Accuracies**: Around 76%
- **Conclusion**: The performance has declined, indicating the current rules are less effective. The model might be underfitting due to oversimplified or improperly implemented rules.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Review and Correct Rule Implementation:**

- **Ensure All Rules Are Applied**: Verify that all 15 rules are correctly implemented in the code and properly applied to generate the feature matrix. The absence of rules in the SHAP analysis suggests a potential issue with feature extraction.
- **Check Feature Matrix Generation**: It is crucial to confirm that the feature matrix accurately reflects the presence or absence of structural features according to the defined rules.

**2. Reevaluate and Refine Rules:**

- **Assess Rule Specificity**: Some rules may be too narrow or specific, causing them not to match any molecules in the dataset. Broaden these rules to cover more relevant structures without losing their predictive power.
- **Balance Rule Complexity**: Ensure that the rules are neither too simplistic (missing important features) nor too complex (causing overfitting). Aim for a balance that captures essential chemical insights.
- **Incorporate Previously Effective Rules**: Reintroduce or adjust rules from earlier iterations that contributed positively to model performance. Compare how these rules align with current data and outcomes.

**3. Utilize SHAP Analysis for Rule Adjustment:**

- **Identify Problematic Rules**: In prior analyses, rules with high positive SHAP values in cases of overprediction (predicted high, experimental low) are likely overestimating loading. Conversely, rules with high negative SHAP values in cases of underprediction (predicted low, experimental high) are likely underestimating loading.
- **Adjust These Rules Accordingly**:
  - **For Overestimations**: Modify or relax rules that are too permissive and lead to false positives.
  - **For Underestimations**: Enhance or specify rules that are too restrictive and lead to false negatives.

**4. Enhance Model Generalization:**

- **Avoid Overfitting Specific Cases**: Ensure that rules are not tailored to specific molecules at the expense of general applicability.
- **Increase Dataset Diversity**: If possible, expand the dataset with more examples that can help the model learn a broader range of chemical features.

**5. Incorporate Additional Chemical Knowledge:**

- **Chemical Intuition**: Reassess the chemical rationale behind each rule. Ensure that each rule is grounded in sound chemical principles that are relevant to the catalytic problem.
- **Update Rules Based on New Insights**: If certain functional groups or structural motifs are known to affect the modifier loading significantly, consider integrating these into the rules.

**6. Iterative Testing and Validation:**

- **Iterate on Rule Adjustments**: After making changes, retrain the model and assess performance. Use SHAP analysis in each iteration to guide further refinements.
- **Cross-Validation**: Continue using cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance and ensure that improvements are consistent across different subsets of the data.

**7. Debugging the Feature Extraction Process:**

- **Validate Rule Application**: For a subset of molecules, manually verify that the rules are correctly identifying the intended features.
- **Implement Logging Mechanisms**: Include logs or outputs in the code to track which rules are activated for each molecule.

---

**Specific Suggestions Based on the Current Rules:**

- **Rule 6 (Polyhydroxylated Acids)**:
  - **Issue**: Rule 6 has zero SHAP value, indicating it doesn't contribute to predictions.
  - **Action**: Review the chemical patterns associated with Rule 6. Ensure that molecules fitting this rule are correctly identified in the dataset.

- **Reintroduce or Adjust Rules with Prior Positive Impact**:
  - **Examples**: Rules like Rule 3 (Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups) previously showed impactful SHAP values.
  - **Action**: Reassess these rules for inclusion and adjust them as necessary to improve predictive performance.

- **Refine Rules with Broad Applicability**:
  - **Issue**: Overly specific rules may not apply to many molecules, limiting their utility.
  - **Action**: Generalize the rules slightly to encompass a wider range of relevant molecules without introducing noise.

- **Address Discrepancies in Predictions**:
  - **Overestimations**: If certain rules contribute to overpredicting high loading, consider adding conditions or exceptions to these rules.
  - **Underestimations**: For rules leading to underprediction, identify missing features or conditions that could enhance their predictive capacity.

---

**Conclusion**

To improve the model's performance:

- **Ensure Proper Implementation**: Verify that all rules are correctly coded and applied.
- **Refine and Rebalance Rules**: Adjust rules based on their impact on predictions, focusing on those contributing to incorrect predictions.
- **Leverage SHAP Analysis**: Use SHAP values to gain insights into each rule's influence and guide adjustments.
- **Iterate Thoughtfully**: Make systematic changes and evaluate their effects through retraining and validation.

By addressing these areas, the model should better capture the relationships between molecular features and modifier loading on the catalyst, leading to improved accuracy and reliability in predictions.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    After analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties, here are the updated rules that describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the yield:

---

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (amino acids with a side-chain carboxylic acid group) result in high yield due to effective chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**aspartic acid**), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**glutamic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with metal centers in the catalyst, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The hydrophobic aliphatic chain facilitates interactions with the catalyst's hydrophobic regions, promoting effective binding.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with metal ions in the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, reducing coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing coordinating nitrogen atoms result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (**nicotinic acid**), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings serve as additional coordination sites with the metal catalyst, enhancing modifier-catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**tryptophan**)
  - *Rationale*: The heteroatom in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal catalyst, strengthening the interaction and improving yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**gluconic acid**)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enable strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the complex.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic ω-amino acids with a chain length of five carbons result in high yield; longer chain lengths result in low yield due to decreased effective coordination.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: A chain length of five carbons optimizes the spatial arrangement for coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains result in low yield due to reduced effective interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt conformations that hinder proper orientation and binding to the catalyst, diminishing catalytic effectiveness.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing aldehyde groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites and reducing efficiency.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density on potential donor atoms, hindering coordination with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic thiols may bind strongly to metal centers, leading to irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are substituted phenylalkanoic acids with a chain length of at least five carbons and containing additional coordinating groups result in high yield; inadequate chain length or lack of coordinating groups leads to low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Sufficient aliphatic chain length allows the coordinating groups to effectively interact with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide adequate spacing for coordination.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups bearing strong electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., trifluoroacetyl) result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, impairing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic systems capable of chelation result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic structures provide additional coordination sites, strengthening the catalyst-modifier complex and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yield due to weaker interactions with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (**phenylalanine**)
  - *Rationale*: Absence of coordinating functional groups in the side chain leads to reduced binding affinity with the catalyst, lowering the yield.

**End of Advice**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The hydrophobic chain facilitates favorable interactions with the catalyst's hydrophobic regions without interference from additional functional groups.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position typically result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents may result in variable yields.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - *Variable Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid** (high yield), **4-methylbenzoic acid** (low yield)
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Electron-donating groups can have mixed effects depending on their ability to coordinate with the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing accessible coordinating nitrogen atoms result in high yield; sterically hindered nitrogen atoms may reduce yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing modifier-catalyst interactions. Steric hindrance can impede this coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains result in low yield due to decreased effective interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether linkages can adopt conformations that prevent proper alignment with the catalyst's active sites, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of chelation (e.g., containing heteroatoms) result in high yield; those with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yield.**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enable strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the complex.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic ω-amino acids with a chain length of five carbons result in high yield; longer chain lengths result in low yield due to decreased effective coordination.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce electron density on potential donor atoms, hindering coordination with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning; aliphatic thiol-containing modifiers may result in high yield.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic thiols may bind strongly to metal centers, leading to irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity. Aliphatic thiols may not have the same deactivating effect.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are substituted phenylalkanoic acids with a chain length of five carbons and additional coordinating groups result in high yield; shorter chain lengths or lack of coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Sufficient aliphatic chain length allows the coordinating groups to effectively interact with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide adequate spacing for coordination.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups bearing strong electron-withdrawing substituents result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, impairing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains result in high yield due to enhanced chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an amino group and an additional carboxylic acid group increases coordination sites, strengthening the catalyst-modifier interaction.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic systems capable of chelation result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic structures provide additional coordination sites through heteroatoms, enhancing the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains and additional functional groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Bulky substituents or long chains with additional functional groups can hinder effective coordination with the catalyst by introducing steric constraints.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for precise prediction based on chain length and the absence of additional functional groups. The property insight logically connects the hydrophobic interactions of medium-length unbranched aliphatic chains to enhanced catalyst activity. The rule is not overly complex and is supported by multiple data points, providing a good balance between simplicity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and effectively distinguishes the impact of electron-withdrawing versus electron-donating substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids. The property insight is sound, relating substituent effects to acidity and coordination with the metal catalyst. The rule considers combinations of functional groups and is well-supported by data points, achieving a balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly explains how accessible coordinating nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic carboxylic acids affect yield. The property insight is appropriate, linking nitrogen coordination to enhanced catalyst interactions. The rule combines structural features and is supported by multiple data points, providing a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in stating that flexible ether chains in modifiers lead to low yield. The property insight is reasonable, connecting conformational flexibility with decreased effective interaction with the catalyst. The rule is specific but is supported by at least two data points, maintaining a balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly differentiates amino acids based on the chelating ability of their side chains. The property insight is appropriate, explaining how heteroatoms enhance coordination with the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of structural features and is supported by data points, achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: While Rule 6 provides logical property insight relating multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding, its coverage is limited to a single data point. This may not be sufficient for robust support. The rule would benefit from additional supporting examples to strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear about the effect of chain length in ω-amino acids on yield. The property insight is plausible, relating chain length to optimal spatial arrangement for coordination. The rule is supported by multiple data points, achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation. The property insight is logical, and the rule is supported by data points, maintaining reasonable balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Although Rule 9 is clear and provides sensible property insight into how fluorinated alkyl chains reduce coordination ability, it is supported by only a single data point. The rule may be too narrow in scope and would benefit from additional examples to improve its coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 effectively contrasts the effects of aromatic and aliphatic thiol-containing modifiers on yield. The property insight is sound, explaining how aromatic thiols may poison the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of structural features and is supported by relevant data points, achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly shows how chain length and coordinating groups in substituted phenylalkanoic acids influence yield. The property insight is logical, relating sufficient aliphatic chain length to effective coordination. With data support, the rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 12**: While Rule 12 is clear and the property insight is reasonable, it is supported by only a single data point, limiting its coverage. The rule may be too specific and would benefit from additional supporting examples to enhance its robustness.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides strong property insight by explaining how additional carboxylate side chains in α-amino acids enhance chelation with the catalyst. The rule is sufficiently complex and is well-supported by multiple data points, achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly explains the impact of heteroaromatic systems capable of chelation on yield. The property insight is adequate, highlighting the role of heteroatoms in enhancing catalyst-modifier interactions. The rule considers specific structural features and is supported by multiple data points, providing good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear in stating that modifiers with long aliphatic chains and additional functional groups can lead to low yield due to steric hindrance. The property insight is appropriate, relating steric constraints to reduced coordination efficiency. The rule combines structural features and is supported by relevant data points, achieving a balance between complexity and coverage.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The hydrophobic chain facilitates favorable interactions with the catalyst's hydrophobic regions without interference from additional functional groups.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position typically result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents may result in variable yields.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - *Variable Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid** (high yield), **4-methylbenzoic acid** (low yield)
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Electron-donating groups can have mixed effects depending on their ability to coordinate with the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing accessible coordinating nitrogen atoms result in high yield; sterically hindered nitrogen atoms may reduce yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing modifier-catalyst interactions. Steric hindrance can impede this coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains result in low yield due to decreased effective interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether linkages can adopt conformations that prevent proper alignment with the catalyst's active sites, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of chelation (e.g., containing heteroatoms) result in high yield; those with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)
  - *Rationale*: Side chains with heteroatoms enhance coordination with the catalyst. Non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains do not contribute to effective binding.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enable strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the complex.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic ω-amino acids with a chain length of five carbons result in high yield; longer chain lengths result in low yield due to decreased effective coordination.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: A five-carbon chain optimizes the spatial arrangement for coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce electron density on potential donor atoms, hindering coordination with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning; aliphatic thiol-containing modifiers may result in high yield.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic thiols may bind strongly to metal centers, leading to irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity. Aliphatic thiols may not have the same deactivating effect.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are substituted phenylalkanoic acids with a chain length of five carbons and additional coordinating groups result in high yield; shorter chain lengths or lack of coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Sufficient aliphatic chain length allows the coordinating groups to effectively interact with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide adequate spacing for coordination.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups bearing strong electron-withdrawing substituents result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, impairing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains result in high yield due to enhanced chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an amino group and an additional carboxylic acid group increases coordination sites, strengthening the catalyst-modifier interaction.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic systems capable of chelation result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic structures provide additional coordination sites through heteroatoms, enhancing the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains and additional functional groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Bulky substituents or long chains with additional functional groups can hinder effective coordination with the catalyst by introducing steric constraints.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: For **Rule 1**, the code fails to identify unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons), such as octanoic acid (SMILES index 6). The SMARTS pattern `'C(=O)[OH]'` is too general and does not specify chain length or branching. Update the SMARTS to `'CCCCCCC[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` to match a seven-carbon chain ending with a carboxylic acid, and use recursive SMARTS or RDKit's `AllChem.DeleteSubstructs()` to ensure the chain is unbranched and acyclic.

- **Suggestion 2**: For **Rule 2**, the code does not correctly identify aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position. The SMARTS pattern `'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O'` does not account for substituents at specific positions. Use SMARTS like `'c1ccc([C](=O)O)cc1[*:1]'` where `[*:1]` is an electron-withdrawing group at the para position. Update the code to check for EWGs at position 4 of the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 3**: For **Rule 3**, the SMARTS patterns `'[nH]1cccc1C(=O)O'` and `'[n]1ccccc1C(=O)O'` do not capture all heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with accessible nitrogen atoms. Expand the patterns to include other heterocycles like pyridine, pyrazole, and their carboxylic acid derivatives. Use patterns like `'[nX2]1cccc1C(=O)O'` and ensure that the nitrogen atom is not sterically hindered.

- **Suggestion 4**: For **Rule 7**, the code incorrectly matches molecules that do not fit the criteria, such as N-acetylated amino acids (SMILES index 34). The SMARTS pattern `'NCCCCCC(=O)O'` is too broad. Modify it to `'NCCCCC[CX3](=O)[O-]'` to specifically match ω-amino acids with a five-carbon chain and a free amino group, excluding N-acylated compounds.

- **Suggestion 5**: For rules involving substitutions at specific positions (**Rule 2** and **Rule 11**), incorporate position-specific SMARTS. Use advanced SMARTS patterns to specify substituents at the para position or along a chain. For example, for para-substituted benzene with an EWG, use `'c1cc([!#1])cc([C](=O)O)c1'` where `[!#1]` represents the EWG.

- **Suggestion 6**: Enhance the handling of chain lengths and branching in the code. For rules requiring specific chain lengths (**Rule 1** and **Rule 7**), calculate the longest carbon chain using RDKit's `rchem.CalcMolSSSR()` and check for branching by analyzing the degree of carbon atoms. Implement functions to assess chain length and branching programmatically rather than relying solely on SMARTS.

- **Suggestion 7**: For **Rule 9**, the SMARTS pattern `'[CX4](F)(F)F'` only matches trifluoromethyl groups and misses other fluorinated alkyl chains. Expand the pattern to match any alkyl chain with fluorine substituents, for example, `'[CX4][CX4](F)[CX4](F)F'` or use a more general pattern that captures perfluorinated chains.

- **Suggestion 8**: Test each SMARTS pattern against known positive and negative examples. Add unit tests or assert statements in the code to verify that each pattern matches the intended molecules. This will help identify mismatches and refine the patterns accordingly.

- **Suggestion 9**: Utilize RDKit's cheminformatics capabilities beyond SMARTS. For properties like electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects, consider using predefined lists or calculating Hammett sigma constants if applicable. For functional group identification, use RDKit's `GetSubstructMatches()` with multiple patterns.

- **Suggestion 10**: Improve error handling and logging within the code. When a molecule does not match a rule but is expected to, output diagnostic information to assist in debugging. This can include reporting which parts of the molecule matched or didn't match the SMARTS patterns.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The hydrophobic chain facilitates favorable interactions with the catalyst's hydrophobic regions without interference from additional functional groups.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position typically result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents may result in variable yields.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - *Variable Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid** (high yield), **4-methylbenzoic acid** (low yield)
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Electron-donating groups can have mixed effects depending on their ability to coordinate with the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing accessible coordinating nitrogen atoms result in high yield; sterically hindered nitrogen atoms may reduce yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing modifier-catalyst interactions. Steric hindrance can impede this coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains result in low yield due to decreased effective interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether linkages can adopt conformations that prevent proper alignment with the catalyst's active sites, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of chelation (e.g., containing heteroatoms) result in high yield; those with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)
  - *Rationale*: Side chains with heteroatoms enhance coordination with the catalyst. Non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains do not contribute to effective binding.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enable strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the complex.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic ω-amino acids with a chain length of five carbons result in high yield; longer chain lengths result in low yield due to decreased effective coordination.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: A five-carbon chain optimizes the spatial arrangement for coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce electron density on potential donor atoms, hindering coordination with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning; aliphatic thiol-containing modifiers may result in high yield.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic thiols may bind strongly to metal centers, leading to irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity. Aliphatic thiols may not have the same deactivating effect.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are substituted phenylalkanoic acids with a chain length of five carbons and additional coordinating groups result in high yield; shorter chain lengths or lack of coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Sufficient aliphatic chain length allows the coordinating groups to effectively interact with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide adequate spacing for coordination.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups bearing strong electron-withdrawing substituents result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, impairing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains result in high yield due to enhanced chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an amino group and an additional carboxylic acid group increases coordination sites, strengthening the catalyst-modifier interaction.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic systems capable of chelation result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic structures provide additional coordination sites through heteroatoms, enhancing the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains and additional functional groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Bulky substituents or long chains with additional functional groups can hinder effective coordination with the catalyst by introducing steric constraints.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 1**, adjust the SMARTS pattern for the carboxylic acid group. The current pattern `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` may not match all carboxylic acids due to different protonation states or representations in RDKit. Use `'[CX3](=O)[O;H1,H0]'` to match both protonated and deprotonated forms of the carboxylic acid group.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Improve the method for calculating the **chain length** in **Rule 1**. The current code might not accurately determine the longest unbranched aliphatic chain. Instead, use RDKit's `Chem.GetLongestCarbonChain(mol)` or iterate over aliphatic chains using breadth-first search to find the longest path of sp³-hybridized carbons.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For the **'unbranched'** condition in **Rule 1**, modify the approach to detect branching more effectively. Instead of checking for carbons with more than two carbon neighbors, use the SMARTS pattern `'[CX4H2][CX4H2]'` repeated `n` times (where `n` is chain length) to match unbranched alkane chains.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Ensure the **'no_other_functional_groups'** condition in **Rule 1** is correctly implemented. The current code may not cover all functional groups. Utilize RDKit's `FunctionalGroupUtils` or define a comprehensive list of functional group SMARTS patterns to check for any groups beyond the carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: In **Rule 2**, the pattern for identifying electron-withdrawing groups (**EWGs**) at the para position may be too restrictive or incorrect. Expand the pattern to include common EWGs such as nitro (`'[N+](=O)[O-]'`), cyano (`'[C]#N'`), and halogens. Adjust the `ewg_patterns` list to include these groups and ensure the SMARTS are correctly constructed for para substitutions.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Extend the code to implement **all 15 rules** instead of just the first 5. This will provide a comprehensive analysis and ensure that modifiers matching later rules are correctly identified in the feature matrix.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For **Rule 3**, broaden the SMARTS patterns to capture a wider range of heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with accessible nitrogen atoms. Include patterns like `'[nH]1cccc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` and consider heterocycles like pyridine, pyrazole, and others mentioned in the rule examples.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Before applying the rules, **sanitize molecules** and ensure that **hydrogens are explicitly added** if necessary. Use `Chem.AddHs(mol)` to add hydrogens, which can be crucial for SMARTS patterns that depend on hydrogen counts.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Incorporate **detailed logging** or **debugging statements** in the code to trace which molecules match each rule. This will help identify where the matching process may be failing and provide insights into necessary corrections.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Utilize RDKit's built-in **functional group filters** or **Substructure Matching** utilities to simplify functional group detection. This can improve accuracy and reduce the complexity of SMARTS patterns.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The hydrophobic chain facilitates favorable interactions with the catalyst's hydrophobic regions without interference from additional functional groups.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position typically result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents may result in variable yields.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - *Variable Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid** (high yield), **4-methylbenzoic acid** (low yield)
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Electron-donating groups can have mixed effects depending on their ability to coordinate with the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing accessible coordinating nitrogen atoms result in high yield; sterically hindered nitrogen atoms may reduce yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing modifier-catalyst interactions. Steric hindrance can impede this coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains result in low yield due to decreased effective interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether linkages can adopt conformations that prevent proper alignment with the catalyst's active sites, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of chelation (e.g., containing heteroatoms) result in high yield; those with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)
  - *Rationale*: Side chains with heteroatoms enhance coordination with the catalyst. Non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains do not contribute to effective binding.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enable strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the complex.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic ω-amino acids with a chain length of five carbons result in high yield; longer chain lengths result in low yield due to decreased effective coordination.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: A five-carbon chain optimizes the spatial arrangement for coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce electron density on potential donor atoms, hindering coordination with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning; aliphatic thiol-containing modifiers may result in high yield.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic thiols may bind strongly to metal centers, leading to irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity. Aliphatic thiols may not have the same deactivating effect.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are substituted phenylalkanoic acids with a chain length of five carbons and additional coordinating groups result in high yield; shorter chain lengths or lack of coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Sufficient aliphatic chain length allows the coordinating groups to effectively interact with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide adequate spacing for coordination.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups bearing strong electron-withdrawing substituents result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, impairing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains result in high yield due to enhanced chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an amino group and an additional carboxylic acid group increases coordination sites, strengthening the catalyst-modifier interaction.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic systems capable of chelation result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic structures provide additional coordination sites through heteroatoms, enhancing the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains and additional functional groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Bulky substituents or long chains with additional functional groups can hinder effective coordination with the catalyst by introducing steric constraints.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: Revise the **'no_other_functional_groups' condition in Rule 1**. Currently, the code uses the SMARTS pattern `'[!#6;!#1]'` to exclude heteroatoms other than carbon and hydrogen. This pattern incorrectly excludes the oxygen atoms in the carboxylic acid group. Instead, modify the exclusion criteria to allow for the carboxylic acid functionality. For example, exclude specific functional groups like alcohols `'[OX2H]'`, amines `'[NX3;!$(N-C=O)]'`, and others, but **allow oxygen atoms in the carboxylic acid**.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Adjust the chain length calculation in Rule 1**. The current method may not correctly calculate the longest carbon chain, especially in carboxylic acids where the carboxyl carbon is included. Modify the code to **calculate the length of the unbranched aliphatic carbon chain excluding the carboxyl carbon**. Consider using RDKit's `Chem.GetMolFrags()` or `Chem.FindAllPathsOfLengthN()` functions for more accurate chain length determination.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine the branching check in Rule 1**. The present code marks any carbon with a degree greater than two as a branching point, which incorrectly includes the carboxyl carbon (connected to two oxygens and one carbon). Update the code to **exclude the carboxyl carbon from the branching condition** by identifying it specifically and not considering it when checking for branches.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Correct the 'must_have' pattern in Rule 1**. The pattern `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0]'` may not match carboxylic acids correctly. It should be updated to `'C(=O)[O-]'` or `'C(=O)O'` to match both protonated and deprotonated carboxylic acid groups accurately.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Remove or modify the 'must_not_have' pattern `'a'` in Rule 1**. This pattern excludes any aromatic atoms, which might not be necessary since the acyclic condition already excludes aromatic rings. If both conditions are needed, ensure they do not redundantly exclude valid molecules.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Enhance Rule 2's pattern for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position**. The current implementation might not capture all relevant EWGs. Expand the list of EWG SMARTS patterns to include other common groups like cyano `'C#N'`, sulfonyl `'(=O)(=O)[#6]'`, and others. Ensure that the SMARTS patterns correctly specify the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Improve the handling of special conditions like 'ewg_para' in Rule 2**. Instead of using boolean flags, consider defining explicit SMARTS patterns that combine the aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, and the EWG at the para position. This will make the pattern matching more straightforward and accurate.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Broaden the SMARTS patterns in Rule 3** to include other heteroaromatic rings with coordinating nitrogen atoms. The current patterns might be too specific. Include patterns for pyrimidine, imidazole, and other relevant heterocycles to capture a wider range of modifiers.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Review and test the SMARTS patterns for each rule with known examples**. For each rule, validate the patterns against both positive and negative examples to ensure they match the intended structures. This will help identify any mismatches or errors in the SMARTS definitions.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Add comments and documentation to the code** explaining the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and condition. This will make the code easier to understand, maintain, and modify in the future.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Metrics**

Upon examining the current rule metrics in comparison to the reference metrics and previous iterations, several observations can be made, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**.

---

**1. Confidence**

- **Reference Metrics (Average Train Confidence):**
  - \( \frac{0.6352 + 0.5396}{2} = 0.5874 \) (approximately)

- **Previous Iterations:**
  - **Iteration 1:** 0.6462
  - **Iteration 2:** 0.6806
  - **Iteration 3:** 0.7500 (Highest)
  - **Iteration 4:** 0.7067
  - **Iteration 5:** 0.6400
  - **Iteration 6:** 0.5000
  - **Current Iteration:** 0.5667

**Observation:**

- The confidence peaked at **Iteration 3** with a value of **0.75**, indicating that 75% of the time when the rule conditions were met, the predicted outcome was correct.
- The current confidence of **0.5667** is **lower than the reference average (0.5874)** and has decreased from previous iterations.
- This decline suggests that the current rules are **less reliable** in predicting high yields compared to earlier rules.

---

**2. Lift**

- **Reference Metrics (Average Train Lift):**
  - \( \frac{1.2048 + 1.0559}{2} = 1.1304 \) (approximately)

- **Previous Iterations:**
  - **Iteration 1:** 1.2845
  - **Iteration 2:** 1.3681
  - **Iteration 3:** 1.4962 (Highest)
  - **Iteration 4:** 1.4163
  - **Iteration 5:** 1.2782
  - **Iteration 6:** 1.0000
  - **Current Iteration:** 1.1259

**Observation:**

- The lift reached its highest at **Iteration 3** with a value of **1.4962**, indicating a strong association between the rule conditions and the high yield outcome.
- The current lift of **1.1259** is **slightly below the reference average (1.1304)** and has decreased from the peaks in previous iterations.
- A lift greater than 1 implies a positive association, but the reduction suggests that the current rules are **less effective** at identifying meaningful relationships compared to earlier iterations.

---

**3. Support**

- **Reference Metrics (Average Train Support):**
  - \( \frac{0.1667 + 0.1845}{2} = 0.1756 \) (approximately)

- **Previous Iterations:**
  - **Iteration 1:** 0.1023
  - **Iteration 2:** 0.0167
  - **Iteration 3:** 0.0476
  - **Iteration 4:** 0.0229
  - **Iteration 5:** 0.0210
  - **Iteration 6:** 0.0000
  - **Current Iteration:** 0.0038

**Observation:**

- Support has significantly decreased over the iterations, with the current support at **0.0038**, meaning the current rules apply to only **0.38%** of the training data.
- This is **substantially lower than the reference average (17.56%)**.
- Low support indicates that the rules are relevant to a very small subset of the data, limiting their overall impact.

---

**4. Leverage**

- **Reference Metrics (Average Train Leverage):**
  - \( \frac{0.0289 + (-0.0041)}{2} = 0.0124 \) (approximately)

- **Previous Iterations:**
  - **Iteration 1:** 0.0095
  - **Iteration 2:** 0.0071
  - **Iteration 3:** 0.0188 (Highest)
  - **Iteration 4:** 0.0097
  - **Iteration 5:** 0.0064
  - **Iteration 6:** 0.0000
  - **Current Iteration:** 0.0019

**Observation:**

- The current leverage is **0.0019**, indicating a minimal difference between the observed and expected support if the items were independent.
- Positive leverage values are desirable, but the low value suggests that the current rules offer **little added value** over random chance.

---

**Conclusion on Performance**

- **Decrease in Confidence and Lift:** The reduction in both confidence and lift compared to previous iterations suggests that the **predictive power** of the current rules has diminished.
- **Low Support:** The very low support indicates that the rules are applicable to a negligible portion of the dataset, thus limiting their practical utility.
- **Overall Effectiveness:** The current rules are **less effective** than previous versions in identifying high-yield modifiers. They neither apply broadly across the dataset nor predict outcomes with high certainty when they do apply.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Sufficiency of Iterations**

- The trend of decreasing confidence and lift after reaching peaks in earlier iterations suggests that the **model may have reached a local minimum**.
- The current rules do not improve upon previous ones in terms of key metrics and, in fact, perform worse.
- **Sufficiency of Iterations:** Continuing with the current approach and rules is unlikely to yield better results. Therefore, it may be time to reconsider the strategy rather than proceeding with more iterations.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

1. **Increase Rule Generality:**

   - **Issue:** Overly specific rules may capture noise rather than meaningful patterns, leading to low support.
   - **Action:** **Simplify rules** to encompass broader chemical features that are associated with high yield.
   - **Example:** Instead of specifying exact chain lengths or positions, focus on the presence of key functional groups or general structural motifs.

2. **Balance Between Confidence and Support:**

   - **Issue:** High confidence with very low support limits the impact of the rules.
   - **Action:** Aim for a **balance** by adjusting rules to slightly reduce confidence but significantly increase support.
   - **Example:** Merge similar rules or remove excessively restrictive conditions that marginally improve confidence but greatly reduce support.

3. **Re-evaluate Rule Conditions:**

   - **Issue:** Some rules may be based on assumptions that do not hold true across the dataset.
   - **Action:** **Analyze misclassifications** to identify why certain modifiers do not fit the current rules, and adjust conditions accordingly.
   - **Example:** If modifiers with electron-donating groups sometimes result in high yield, consider incorporating context or additional factors that influence this outcome.

4. **Incorporate Additional Data Analysis:**

   - **Issue:** The current rules may not capture all relevant factors affecting yield.
   - **Action:** Perform **statistical analyses** (e.g., correlation matrices, decision trees) to identify new patterns or interactions between features.
   - **Example:** Use machine learning models to uncover non-obvious relationships that can inform the development of improved rules.

5. **Include Negative Cases in Rule Formation:**

   - **Issue:** Focusing solely on high-yield examples may overlook patterns present in low-yield cases.
   - **Action:** **Analyze low-yield modifiers** to understand common features that could be used to refine rules.
   - **Example:** Identify structural elements that consistently result in low yield and adjust rules to exclude modifiers possessing these elements.

6. **Iterative Testing and Validation:**

   - **Issue:** Without testing the rules on unseen data, overfitting may occur.
   - **Action:** Implement **cross-validation** techniques to ensure rules generalize well beyond the training set.
   - **Example:** Divide the dataset into multiple folds, using each as a validation set in turn while training on the others.

7. **Consult Domain Expertise:**

   - **Issue:** Chemical intuition may identify important factors not evident from data alone.
   - **Action:** **Engage with chemists** to review rules for theoretical plausibility and practical relevance.
   - **Example:** Verify whether certain functional groups are known to interfere with catalysts, and adjust rules based on expert feedback.

8. **Adjust Metric Thresholds:**

   - **Issue:** Strict thresholds for confidence and lift may be limiting rule acceptance.
   - **Action:** **Reconsider the thresholds** used for accepting rules, possibly allowing for slightly lower confidence if support increases significantly.
   - **Example:** Accept rules with confidence above 0.6 instead of 0.7 if they result in double the support.

---

By addressing these areas, the current rules can be enhanced to improve their overall performance. This involves **finding a balance** between making the rules general enough to apply broadly while maintaining sufficient confidence and lift to be useful predictors. Incorporating both data-driven insights and chemical knowledge will lead to more robust and practical rules for predicting high-yield modifiers in catalytic reactions.

ML Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Validation and Training Set Accuracies**

The latest 5-fold cross-validation accuracy is **42.86%**, which is significantly lower than the previous validation accuracies that averaged around **76%**. The decrease in accuracy suggests that the current rules are not effectively capturing the relationship between the molecular features and the catalytic performance.

**Comparison with Previous Iterations:**

- **Previous Accuracies:** Validation accuracies consistently around **76%** with test accuracies between **62.5%** and **75%**.
- **Current Accuracy:** Validation accuracy has dropped to **42.86%**, indicating a substantial decline in model performance.

This notable decrease implies that the current set of rules may be underfitting the data, failing to recognize important patterns that were previously captured.

---

**SHAP Value Analysis and Rule Assessment**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values help identify the contribution of each rule to the model's predictions. Analyzing the SHAP values provides insights into which rules are influencing the predictions and how they might be adjusted.

**Observations from SHAP Analysis:**

1. **Dominance of Rule 12:**
   - The SHAP analysis indicates that only **Rule 12** is contributing to the predictions in the current model.
   - For most molecules, **Rule 12** has a SHAP value of either **0.0172** (approximate positive contribution) or **0**, suggesting it's the primary rule affecting the output.

2. **Discrepancies in Predictions:**
   - **False Negatives:** There are several instances where the **predicted loading is low** but the **experimental value is high**.
     - **Example Molecules:** 
       - C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
       - C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O
     - **SHAP Values:** In these cases, **Rule 12** has a positive SHAP value, yet the model predicts a low loading, indicating a potential problem with the rule or its implementation.

   - **False Positives:** Instances where the **predicted loading is high** but the **experimental value is low**.
     - **Example Molecules:** 
       - COCCOCCOCC(=O)O
       - C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O
     - **SHAP Values:** **Rule 12** again shows a positive SHAP value, contributing to the incorrect high prediction.

3. **Lack of Other Rules in SHAP Analysis:**
   - Unlike previous iterations where multiple rules contributed to the predictions, the current model seems to rely solely on **Rule 12**.
   - This reliance suggests that other potentially significant rules are not being considered, which may lead to underfitting.

---

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

- The current rules, particularly **Rule 12**, are not effective enough to accurately predict the catalytic performance.
- The model's heavy reliance on a single rule indicates a loss of valuable information contained in other rules.

**Overfitting vs. Underfitting:**

- **Underfitting:** The model is likely underfitting, as it fails to capture the complexity of the data with the limited features derived from only one rule.
- **Evidence of Underfitting:**
  - Significant drop in validation accuracy compared to previous iterations.
  - Poor generalization to unseen data.

**Discrepancies and Problematic Rules:**

- **Rule 12** shows positive SHAP values in both correctly and incorrectly predicted instances, indicating it does not discriminate well between high and low yields.
- The rule contributes to false positives and false negatives, suggesting it may not be adequately capturing the factors influencing the catalytic performance.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Re-evaluate Rule 12:**
   - **Clarify the Rule:** Ensure that **Rule 12** is accurately defined and implemented. It currently states:

     *"Modifiers with acylated amino groups bearing strong electron-withdrawing substituents result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group."*

   - **Assessment:** This rule may be too narrow or not general enough to distinguish between high and low yields in the dataset.
   - **Action:** 
     - Modify the rule to better capture the influence of electron-withdrawing groups on the amino groups.
     - Consider the impact of different substituents and their positions on the modifier's performance.

2. **Include Additional Rules:**
   - **Reintroduce Previously Effective Rules:** Incorporate other rules that were contributing to higher accuracies in previous iterations, such as **Rules 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11**.
   - **Reasoning:** The previous models achieved higher accuracies when multiple rules were considered, suggesting that a combination of features is necessary for accurate predictions.

3. **Refine Problematic Rules Based on SHAP Values:**
   - **Adjust Rules with High Positive SHAP Values for Incorrect Predictions:**
     - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but experimental value is low, identify if any rule (other than Rule 12) has a high positive SHAP value. Since only Rule 12 is present, focus on refining it.
   - **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values for Incorrect Predictions:**
     - For molecules where the predicted loading is low but experimental value is high, look for rules with high negative SHAP values. Again, Rule 12 is the only one contributing.

4. **Improve Feature Matrix Generation:**
   - **Verify Feature Extraction:**
     - Ensure that the feature matrix includes all relevant rules and that features are correctly computed.
   - **Action:**
     - Check for errors or omissions in the feature extraction process that may have led to only Rule 12 being considered.
     - Update the feature generation code to include all pertinent rules.

5. **Balance Complexity and Generalization:**
   - **Avoid Over-reliance on a Single Rule:**
     - A model relying on a single feature is prone to underfitting.
   - **Action:**
     - Develop a more nuanced set of rules that capture different aspects of the modifiers' structures and their interactions with the catalyst.
     - Utilize domain knowledge to create rules that consider steric effects, electronic properties, and coordination abilities.

6. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Analysis:**
   - **Use SHAP Values to Guide Rule Adjustments:**
     - Continuously analyze SHAP values after each iteration to identify which rules positively or negatively impact the predictions.
   - **Action:**
     - For rules contributing to incorrect predictions, reassess their definitions and consider splitting them into more specific sub-rules.
     - For rules not contributing significantly, evaluate if they should be modified or possibly removed.

7. **Enhance Model Complexity Appropriately:**
   - **Incorporate Machine Learning Algorithms:**
     - Consider using algorithms that can capture nonlinear relationships if the rules-based approach remains insufficient.
   - **Action:**
     - Implement models like decision trees or random forests that can automatically identify important features and interactions.

---

**Conclusion**

The current model's low accuracy indicates that the existing rules, particularly the reliance on **Rule 12**, are insufficient for accurate predictions. By reintroducing and refining previously effective rules and ensuring a comprehensive feature matrix, we can improve the model's performance. Iterative analysis using SHAP values will help in fine-tuning the rules and enhancing the model's ability to generalize, ultimately leading to better predictive accuracy.

**Summary and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The recent analysis of the rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction highlights several key issues affecting their performance:

**Key Findings:**

1. **Decline in Performance Metrics:**
   - **Confidence and Lift:** Both metrics have decreased compared to earlier iterations. This suggests that the rules are less reliable and have a weaker association with high yield outcomes.
   - **Support:** The current rules apply to a very small subset of the data (0.38% support), limiting their practical utility.
   - **Validation Accuracy:** The 5-fold cross-validation accuracy has dropped significantly to **42.86%** from previous values around **76%**, indicating poor model performance.

2. **SHAP Analysis Issues:**
   - The model relies almost exclusively on **Rule 12**, with minimal contribution from other rules.
   - **Rule 12** shows positive SHAP values even in incorrect predictions, indicating it does not effectively discriminate between high and low yields.
   - The lack of influence from other rules suggests important patterns are being missed.

3. **Underfitting Concerns:**
   - The heavy reliance on a single rule points to underfitting, where the model fails to capture the complexity of the data.
   - Important features and interactions recognized in previous iterations are not being utilized.

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Revise Rule 1:**
   - **Adjust Functional Group Exclusions:** Modify the 'no_other_functional_groups' condition to allow for the carboxylic acid group while excluding other functional groups like alcohols and amines.
   - **Correct Chain Length Calculation:** Ensure the aliphatic chain length excludes the carboxyl carbon and accurately reflects the molecule's structure.
   - **Refine Branching Criteria:** Exclude the carboxyl carbon when determining branching to prevent false positives.

2. **Enhance Rule 2:**
   - **Expand Electron-Withdrawing Group (EWG) Patterns:** Include additional EWGs such as cyano (-C≡N) and sulfonyl (-SO₂-) groups in the SMARTS patterns.
   - **Improve Positional Specificity:** Use precise SMARTS patterns to ensure substituents are correctly identified at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

3. **Broaden Rule 3:**
   - **Include Diverse Heteroaromatic Rings:** Expand the patterns to encompass other nitrogen-containing heterocycles like pyrimidine and imidazole.
   - **Address Steric Hindrance:** Modify the rule to account for sterically hindered nitrogen atoms that might reduce coordination efficiency.

4. **Reintroduce Effective Rules from Previous Iterations:**
   - Bring back rules that previously contributed to higher accuracies, such as Rules **2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11**.
   - **Modify Rules Based on SHAP Analysis:** Adjust or split rules that contributed to incorrect predictions to improve specificity.

5. **Balance Rule Specificity and Generality:**
   - **Avoid Over-Specification:** Simplify overly specific rules to increase their applicability without sacrificing accuracy.
   - **Merge Similar Rules:** Combine rules with overlapping conditions to improve support and coverage.

6. **Improve Feature Extraction:**
   - **Check for Implementation Errors:** Ensure that the feature matrix correctly includes all relevant rules and that features are accurately computed.
   - **Include All Pertinent Rules:** Verify that all previously effective rules are represented in the model.

7. **Incorporate Additional Data Analysis Techniques:**
   - **Statistical Analysis:** Use methods like correlation matrices and decision trees to identify new patterns and important features.
   - **Machine Learning Models:** Consider employing algorithms capable of capturing nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables.

8. **Consult Domain Experts:**
   - **Chemical Expertise:** Collaborate with chemists to validate the theoretical plausibility of the rules and gain insights into chemical behaviors.
   - **Rule Validation:** Use expert knowledge to assess and adjust rules based on known chemical properties and reactions.

9. **Adjust Metric Thresholds:**
   - **Reconsider Acceptance Criteria:** Allow for slightly lower confidence levels if it results in significantly increased support.
   - **Aim for Balance:** Strive for a compromise between rule accuracy and applicability.

10. **Iteratively Refine Rules Using SHAP Values:**
    - **Analyze Rule Contributions:** Continuously assess the impact of each rule on the model's predictions.
    - **Focus on High-Impact Rules:** Prioritize refining rules that significantly affect the model's performance.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is considerable potential for further optimization of the current rules without the risk of overfitting. By refining the existing rules, reintroducing effective ones from previous iterations, and ensuring comprehensive feature inclusion, the model can better capture the complex relationships inherent in the data. Utilizing additional data analysis methods and domain expertise will facilitate the development of more accurate and generalizable rules, ultimately improving the predictive performance of the model.

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) and no additional functional groups result in high yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: The hydrophobic chain facilitates favorable interactions with the catalyst's hydrophobic regions without interference from additional functional groups.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position typically result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents may result in variable yields.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - *Variable Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid** (high yield), **4-methylbenzoic acid** (low yield)
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Electron-donating groups can have mixed effects depending on their ability to coordinate with the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing accessible coordinating nitrogen atoms result in high yield; sterically hindered nitrogen atoms may reduce yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing modifier-catalyst interactions. Steric hindrance can impede this coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with flexible ether chains result in low yield due to decreased effective interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether linkages can adopt conformations that prevent proper alignment with the catalyst's active sites, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of chelation (e.g., containing heteroatoms) result in high yield; those with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)
  - *Rationale*: Side chains with heteroatoms enhance coordination with the catalyst. Non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains do not contribute to effective binding.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) result in high yield due to enhanced chelation and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enable strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the complex.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic ω-amino acids with a chain length of five carbons result in high yield; longer chain lengths result in low yield due to decreased effective coordination.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: A five-carbon chain optimizes the spatial arrangement for coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may form stable complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, interfering with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce electron density on potential donor atoms, hindering coordination with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning; aliphatic thiol-containing modifiers may result in high yield.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic thiols may bind strongly to metal centers, leading to irreversible inhibition of catalytic activity. Aliphatic thiols may not have the same deactivating effect.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are substituted phenylalkanoic acids with a chain length of five carbons and additional coordinating groups result in high yield; shorter chain lengths or lack of coordinating groups result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Sufficient aliphatic chain length allows the coordinating groups to effectively interact with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide adequate spacing for coordination.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups bearing strong electron-withdrawing substituents result in low yield due to decreased coordination ability of the amino group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing acyl groups reduce electron density on the amino nitrogen, impairing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains result in high yield due to enhanced chelation with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an amino group and an additional carboxylic acid group increases coordination sites, strengthening the catalyst-modifier interaction.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic systems capable of chelation result in high yield due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic structures provide additional coordination sites through heteroatoms, enhancing the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains and additional functional groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
  - *Rationale*: Bulky substituents or long chains with additional functional groups can hinder effective coordination with the catalyst by introducing steric constraints.

**End of Rules**

These updated rules combine multiple substructures and functional groups to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield in the reaction. They cover a broad range of the dataset and balance simplicity with complexity, providing effective guidance for future modifier design.---------------------------------------------------------------
