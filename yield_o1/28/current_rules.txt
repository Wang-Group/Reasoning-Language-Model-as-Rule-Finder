**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (having an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups on adjacent carbons) tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: The amino and dicarboxylic acid groups can chelate the metal center effectively, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

   - **Examples**:
     - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid) — **High Yield**
     - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid) — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexamples**:
     - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine) — **Low Yield** (Lacks a second carboxylic acid group)

---

2. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, bromomethyl) tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups at the para position enhance the electron density of the carboxylate and provide additional coordination sites, improving metal binding.

   - **Examples**:
     - *4-aminobenzoic acid* — **High Yield**
     - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* — **High Yield**
     - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* — **High Yield** (Though nitro is electron-withdrawing, its ability to coordinate can enhance metal binding)

   - **Counterexamples**:
     - *4-methylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Methyl group is less effective in coordination)
     - *4-formylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Formyl group can interfere with coordination)

---

3. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched chains of medium length (5-8 carbons) and lacking additional polar substituents tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Such acids can coordinate without steric hindrance or electronic interference from other groups, promoting efficient catalyst formation.

   - **Example**:
     - *Octanoic acid* — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexamples**:
     - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Hydroxyl group introduces polarity)
     - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Amino group can interfere with coordination)

---

4. **Modifiers containing both a thiol (-SH) group and a carboxylic acid on a short aliphatic chain tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Thiol and carboxylate groups can form strong coordination bonds with metals, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - **Example**:
     - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexample**:
     - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Aromatic ring may reduce thiol accessibility)

---

5. **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids (carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups) tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in additional hydrogen bonding and coordination, stabilizing the metal complex.

   - **Examples**:
     - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid) — **High Yield**
     - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* — **High Yield**

---

6. **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring adjacent to the carboxylate group tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

   - **Examples**:
     - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid) — **High Yield**
     - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* — **High Yield**
     - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexample**:
     - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Nitrogen is not adjacent to the carboxylate)

---

7. **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains capable of metal coordination tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Heteroaromatic side chains can provide additional coordination sites, enhancing catalyst effectiveness.

   - **Example**:
     - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan) — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexample**:
     - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine) — **Low Yield** (Phenyl group lacks coordination ability)

---

8. **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., fluorinated chains, formyl groups) near the carboxylate tend to result in low yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Examples**:
     - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* — **Low Yield**
     - *4-formylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield**

---

9. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids linked via flexible aliphatic chains to additional coordinating groups tend to result in high yields if the chain length allows effective coordination.**

   - **Rationale**: Optimal chain length permits the coordinating group to interact with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - **Examples**:
     - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* — **High Yield**
     - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexample**:
     - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Shorter chain may prevent effective coordination)

---

10. **Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids or have blocked amino groups tend to result in low yields due to decreased coordination capacity.**

    - **Rationale**: Acylation hinders the amino group's ability to coordinate with the metal.

    - **Example**:
      - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* — **Low Yield**

---

11. **Modifiers with long, flexible ether chains adjacent to the carboxylate group tend to result in low yields.**

    - **Rationale**: Ether chains can increase flexibility and solubility but may reduce effective metal coordination due to steric hindrance or conformational freedom.

    - **Example**:
      - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* — **Low Yield**

---

12. **Modifiers containing carbonyl groups within the aliphatic chain near the carboxylate tend to result in low yields.**

    - **Rationale**: Internal carbonyl groups can interfere with metal coordination by competing for binding or altering electronic properties.

    - **Example**:
      - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* — **Low Yield**

---

13. **Modifiers with polar substituents (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on long aliphatic chains tend to result in low yields due to steric and electronic effects.**

    - **Rationale**: Polar groups distant from the carboxylate can introduce steric hindrance and disrupt optimal metal coordination.

    - **Examples**:
      - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* — **Low Yield**
      - *8-aminooctanoic acid* — **Low Yield**

---

14. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at positions that hinder coordination (e.g., ortho-substitution) tend to result in low yields.**

    - **Rationale**: Substituents at positions adjacent to the carboxylate can create steric hindrance, reducing metal binding efficiency.

    - **Example**:
      - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Ortho-formyl and hydroxyl groups may hinder coordination)

---

15. **Modifiers with bulky electron-donating groups that do not effectively participate in coordination tend to result in low yields.**

    - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can prevent the modifier from approaching the metal center closely enough for effective coordination.

    - **Example**:
      - *4-methylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield**
