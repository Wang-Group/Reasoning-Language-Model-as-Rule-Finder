Such substituents do not significantly enhance coordination with the catalyst and may hinder catalytic efficiency.

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen heteroatoms** (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms in the ring facilitate coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability.

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains**, such as **L-tryptophan** (containing an indole ring), result in a **high yield**. The presence of heteroatoms in the side chain enhances interactions with the metal center.

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains** without heteroatoms (e.g., **L-phenylalanine**) result in a **low yield**. The lack of coordinating heteroatoms reduces effective interaction with the metal centers.

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde functional groups** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst.

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**) or **fluorinated functional groups** (e.g., **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**.

The flexible ether linkages introduce steric hindrance and reduce the overall coordination ability of the ligand.

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups attached to aromatic rings** (e.g., **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**) can result in a **high yield** if the hydroxyl group enhances interaction with the catalyst. However, similar modifiers with hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**) result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination efficiency.

14. **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are derivatives of amino acids with additional functional groups** that can interfere with coordination (e.g., **N-acetyl-L-lysine**, **methionine derivatives**) result in a **low yield**. The added groups may sterically hinder coordination or bind irreversibly to the metal center.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward identification of modifiers fitting the criteria—amino acids with acidic side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups adjacent to the amino group. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, explaining how the extra carboxylate enhances metal coordination through bidentate chelation. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (amino acids with specific side chains) and is supported by at least two data points: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, both resulting in high yield. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly identifies aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents as leading to high yield. It provides sufficient physical-chemical insight by explaining that electron-withdrawing groups increase carboxyl acidity, enhancing metal coordination. The rule combines sub-structures and is supported by multiple data points—4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, and 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid—all showing high yield. The complexity and coverage are well-balanced.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents result in low yield. While the rule is clear and provides appropriate physical-chemical reasoning, there is an inconsistency in the data. Although 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid fit the rule and exhibit low yield, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid, which also contains electron-donating methoxy groups, results in a high yield. This contradiction suggests limited coverage and indicates that the rule may not fully account for all relevant factors.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear, focusing on modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms capable of chelation, leading to high yield. It offers adequate physical-chemical insight by highlighting the role of nitrogen atoms in stabilizing the metal center. However, there is a discrepancy: while pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid support the rule with high yields, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, which also fits the structural criteria, results in a low yield. This inconsistency suggests that additional factors may influence the outcome, indicating limited coverage of the rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly identifies aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group on a short carbon chain (three to five carbons) as resulting in high yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, explaining effective bidentate coordination due to the proximity of amino and carboxyl groups. The rule combines sub-structures and is supported by at least two data points—5-aminopentanoic acid and 4-aminobenzoic acid—both yielding high results. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains lacking polar substituents lead to high yield. While the rule is clear and provides some physical-chemical reasoning regarding hydrophobic interactions, it is supported by only one data point—octanoic acid. The limited coverage and simplicity of the rule may not adequately capture the complexity of the system, suggesting the need for additional supporting data.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and provides sufficient physical-chemical insight by explaining how distant polar substituents on long aliphatic chains may hinder metal coordination. It combines sub-structures and is supported by at least two data points—7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid—both resulting in low yield. The rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 focuses on modifiers containing aliphatic thiol groups adjacent to the carboxyl group, resulting in high yield. The rule is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight about sulfur's nucleophilicity enhancing metal coordination. However, it is supported by only one data point—3-sulfanylpropanoic acid. The limited coverage diminishes the robustness of the rule.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly identifies aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde substituents as resulting in low yield, providing appropriate physical-chemical reasoning about interference with metal coordination. The rule combines sub-structures and is supported by at least two data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—both showing low yield. The balance between complexity and coverage is satisfactory.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 specifies that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or multiple fluorine atoms result in low yield. While the rule is clear and offers physical-chemical insight, it may oversimplify the effects of fluorination. Supported by at least two data points—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid—both showing low yield, the rule has acceptable coverage but may benefit from refinement in physical-chemical explanation.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 identifies amino acids with non-coordinating, hydrophobic side chains lacking additional heteroatoms as resulting in low yield. While the rule is clear and provides physical-chemical reasoning, there is an inconsistency. (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine) results in low yield, supporting the rule, but (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan) results in high yield despite fitting the structural criteria. This inconsistency suggests limited coverage and indicates that additional factors may influence the outcome.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear, stating that modifiers containing long polyether chains or PEG moieties result in low yield due to steric hindrance and hindered coordination. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight and combines sub-structures. Supported by at least two data points—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid—both showing low yield, the rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 focuses on modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains resulting in high yield. While the rule is clear and offers physical-chemical reasoning about increased solubility and additional coordination sites, it is supported by only one data point—(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid). The limited coverage reduces the strength and general applicability of the rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding lead to low yield, providing appropriate physical-chemical insight. The rule is clear and combines sub-structures but is supported by only one data point—2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid. This limited coverage diminishes the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 identifies modifiers containing aromatic thiol groups as resulting in low yield, explaining that delocalization of sulfur's lone pair electrons decreases nucleophilicity. While the rule is clear and offers physical-chemical insight, it is supported by only one data point—4-sulfanylbenzoic acid. The limited coverage suggests that the rule may not be sufficiently generalizable.

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups**, such as **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid), result in a **high yield**. The extra carboxylate groups enhance chelation with the metal catalyst, improving coordination and activity.

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating functional groups**, such as **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine) and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, result in a **low yield**. The absence of side-chain coordinating sites reduces interaction with the catalyst, diminishing effectiveness.

3. **Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents** like **nitro** or **bromo** groups (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**), result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance coordination with the metal catalyst.

4. **Rule 4**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating para-substituents lacking additional coordinating groups**, such as **4-methylbenzoic acid**, result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

5. **Rule 5**: **Heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the heteroatom is adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The heteroatom (nitrogen) enhances binding to the metal center through additional coordination.

6. **Rule 6**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) substituents on the ring**, like **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination or undergo side reactions, reducing catalyst efficiency.

7. **Rule 7**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains lacking polar substituents**, such as **octanoic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may promote favorable interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing reactivity.

8. **Rule 8**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups distant from the carboxyl group** (more than five carbons away), such as **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, result in a **low yield**. Distant polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or disrupt optimal binding to the metal center.

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The thiol group provides strong coordination with the metal due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur. Conversely, **thiol groups on aromatic rings**, like in **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in a **low yield** because aromatic delocalization reduces sulfur's nucleophilicity.

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** or multiple **fluorine atoms** on the alkyl side chain (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**), result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorines decreases electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interaction with the metal center.

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing long polyether chains** or **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties**, such as **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether linkages and increased steric bulk hinder proper coordination with the metal catalyst.

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains**, like **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and offer additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with bulky or complex structures**, such as **peptides** or **peptide-like compounds** (e.g., **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**), result in a **low yield**. Increased steric hindrance and complexity interfere with catalyst interaction, reducing effectiveness.

14. **Rule 14**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding**, such as **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of coordinating sites, diminishing catalyst interaction.

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with additional ketone groups on aliphatic side chains attached to aromatic rings**, like **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** and **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The ketone groups provide extra coordination sites via carbonyl oxygens, enhancing binding to the metal center.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** clearly addresses heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with adjacent heteroatoms, resulting in high yields. The insight on enhanced metal binding through additional coordination is strong. Complexity is present by considering heteroatoms and their positions. Data points for nicotinic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid provide sufficient coverage. The rule is well-balanced.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** clearly specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde substituents yield low results. The explanation about interference with metal coordination is plausible. Complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific substituents. Supported by 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, coverage is satisfactory. The balance between complexity and coverage is good.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains lacking polar substituents result in high yields. The clarity is acceptable.

The balance leans toward simplicity with limited coverage.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** is clear in identifying aliphatic carboxylic acids with distant polar groups yielding low results. The rationale regarding steric hindrance or disrupted binding is sound. The rule's complexity is adequate, considering chain length and functional group position. Supported by 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid, coverage meets the criteria. Balance is well-achieved.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** distinguishes between thiol groups adjacent to carboxyl groups (high yield) and those on aromatic rings (low yield), with clear reasoning provided. The property insight about sulfur's nucleophilicity is valid. The rule has good complexity by comparing different structural contexts. Supported by 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield), coverage is sufficient. The balance is appropriate.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** clearly states that modifiers with perfluorinated chains result in low yields. The chemical reasoning about electron-withdrawing effects is appropriate. Complexity is moderate, focusing on specific substituents. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (nonafluoropentanoic acid), which weakens the rule's robustness. Balance could be improved with additional supporting data.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** specifies that modifiers with long polyether chains yield low results. The explanation involving steric hindrance is plausible. Complexity is adequate, considering polymeric structures. Coverage is limited to one data point, diminishing the rule's strength. Balance between complexity and coverage is lacking due to insufficient data support.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** indicates that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short chains result in high yields. The property insight is solid, noting increased solubility and coordination sites. Complexity is present by involving multiple functional groups. Coverage is limited to gluconic acid, which is insufficient for strong support. Balance could be improved with more data points.

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **alpha-amino acids**—aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group directly attached to the alpha-carbon—result in a **high yield**. The amino and carboxyl groups can chelate the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid), and **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro** or **bromomethyl** groups, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the heteroatom adjacent to the carboxyl group**, resulting in enhanced coordination through additional lone pairs, lead to a **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (≤5 carbons) with coordinating groups (e.g., amino, thiol, hydroxyl) near the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. These groups facilitate strong binding to the metal center. Examples include **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, and **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl** or **methoxy** groups, result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate. Examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) or phenolic hydroxyl groups on the ring** result in a **low yield**. These groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or engage in side reactions, hindering metal coordination. Examples include **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (≥6 carbons) with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** result in a **low yield**. The long hydrophobic chains introduce steric hindrance and reduce solubility, impairing effective coordination. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, and **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains or multiple ether linkages**, such as **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties**, result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether chains create steric barriers and decrease the overall coordination strength. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains or multiple fluorine atoms** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal binding. Examples include **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amide linkages or peptide bonds** result in a **low yield**. Amide groups can form hydrogen bonds and introduce steric hindrance, interfering with metal coordination. Examples include **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with lactone or diketone rings**, providing additional carbonyl groups for metal coordination, result in a **high yield**. These structures enhance binding affinity to the metal center. An example is **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on the ring** result in a **low yield**. The thiol group can strongly bind to the metal center, potentially deactivating the catalyst by blocking active sites. An example is **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring within three carbons of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. The aromatic ring can participate in π-interactions and provide additional coordination sites. Examples include **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with pyridine rings not adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The distant heteroatoms are less effective in coordinating with the metal center. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The separation reduces the likelihood of simultaneous coordination, decreasing binding strength. An example is **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.

   - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – amino group is five carbons away from the carboxyl group.
   - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – hydroxyl group is four carbons away from the carboxyl group.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing rings capable of metal coordination**, such as **pyridine** or **pyrazole**, result in a **high yield**. The lone pair electrons on nitrogen enhance coordination with the metal center. Examples include:

   - **Octanoic acid** – eight-carbon saturated fatty acid.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **long flexible chains with multiple ether linkages**, such as **polyether carboxylic acids**, result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric hindrance of ether chains reduce effective coordination with the metal center. Examples include:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** – triethylene glycol monomethyl ether with a carboxylate end.
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** – contains multiple ether linkages and an amino group distant from the carboxyl group.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids or those with multiple fluorine atoms** result in a **low yield**. Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination. Example:

    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** – pyridine ring linked through a butanoic acid chain.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without an aliphatic linker** result in a **low yield**. Direct conjugation can cause steric hindrance or electronic interference with metal coordination. Example:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – two aromatic rings directly connected.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **thiol groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids** result in a **low yield**. Thiol groups may form disulfide bonds or interact unfavorably with the metal center. Example:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** – thiol group at the para position.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups attached to the carbon chain**, capable of forming chelate rings with metals, result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyls enhance coordination and stability of the metal complex. Examples include:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) – multiple hydroxyl groups along the chain.
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** – features several hydroxyl groups and an ether linkage near the carboxyl group.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is generally clear and provides strong property insight by emphasizing the importance of an amino group at the alpha or beta position for chelation with the metal center, enhancing catalyst efficiency. It is supported by data points such as (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, both resulting in high yield. However, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid, which also has an amino group at the α-position but includes a bulky aromatic group at the β-position, results in a low yield. This suggests that the presence of bulky substituents adjacent to the amino group might interfere with chelation, indicating the rule may need refinement to account for steric hindrance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and offers good property insight by explaining how electron-withdrawing groups at the para position enhance the acidity of the carboxylate, strengthening metal coordination. It is well-supported by data points like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, both yielding high. There are no contradictory examples in the dataset, indicating strong coverage and reliability of the rule.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and provides adequate property insight into the role of nitrogen-containing heterocycles in metal coordination. It is supported by data points such as pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, both resulting in high yield. However, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yields low, possibly due to steric hindrance or the nitrogen's position relative to the carboxylate. This suggests the rule may benefit from specifying the importance of nitrogen atom positioning within the ring and proximity to the carboxylate group.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and provides strong property insight by highlighting how multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate enhance metal binding through chelation. It is supported by data points like gluconic acid and the polyhydroxylated acetic acid derivative, both yielding high. There are no contradicting examples, indicating good coverage and effectiveness of the rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is somewhat clear and provides modest property insight by suggesting that unfunctionalized long hydrophobic chains allow effective metal coordination due to minimal steric hindrance near the carboxylate. However, its coverage is limited to a single data point (octanoic acid), with no additional examples to strengthen the rule. This limits the confidence in its general applicability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and offers solid property insight by explaining that amino or hydroxyl groups located more than three carbons away from the carboxylate are less effective in coordinating with the metal center. It is well-supported by multiple data points, including 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, all resulting in low yield. This demonstrates strong coverage and validates the rule.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and provides good property insight by indicating that electron-donating groups at the para position reduce carboxylate acidity and weaken metal coordination. It is supported by data points like 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, both yielding low. However, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yields high, which may seem contradictory. This discrepancy suggests that the rule applies specifically when the electron-donating group is directly attached to the aromatic ring bearing the carboxylate, and the rule may need to specify this limitation for clarity.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and offers adequate property insight into how bulky substituents near the carboxylate cause steric hindrance, interfering with metal coordination. It is supported by the data point 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yielding low. While coverage is limited, the rule effectively explains the observed outcome and emphasizes the significance of steric factors.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and provides good property insight by explaining that long flexible chains with multiple ether linkages reduce effective coordination due to increased entropy and steric hindrance. It is supported by data points like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, both resulting in low yield. This demonstrates satisfactory coverage and supports the rule's validity.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and offers property insight by indicating that multiple fluorine atoms reduce the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination. However, the rule's coverage is limited to a single data point (nonafluoropentanoic acid), which diminishes the strength of the rule due to insufficient supporting data.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and provides adequate property insight by highlighting that aldehyde groups at the para position can hinder metal coordination due to potential side reactions or altered electronic distribution. It is supported by data points like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, both yielding low. This demonstrates acceptable coverage and reinforces the rule's validity.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is somewhat clear and gives property insight by suggesting that thiol groups near the carboxylate enhance metal coordination through strong binding. It is supported by the data point 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid yielding high. However, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid yields low, indicating that the rule may need refinement to specify that the thiol group must be on an aliphatic chain and in close proximity to the carboxylate for effective coordination. Coverage is limited, so the rule's general applicability may be constrained.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides property insight by explaining that para-amino groups on aromatic carboxylic acids enhance metal binding through additional coordination sites. It is supported by the data point 4-aminobenzoic acid yielding high. However, coverage is restricted to this single example, so further data would strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear and offers adequate property insight into how functional groups capable of forming chelate rings, like ketone or lactone groups adjacent to the carboxylate, increase complex stability and catalytic efficiency. It is supported by data points like 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid and possibly 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, both yielding high. This provides moderate coverage and supports the rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and provides property insight by suggesting that extended conjugation with ketone or ether linkages near the carboxylate facilitates electron delocalization, strengthening metal-ligand interactions. It is supported by the data point 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid yielding high. However, the rule's coverage is limited to this single example, requiring more data for stronger validation.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **amino or hydroxyl groups located three or more carbons away from the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating with the metal center. Examples include:
   - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** – amino group four carbons away from carboxylate.

   - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – hydroxyl group four carbons away.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the para position** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or alter electronic distribution, hindering metal coordination. Examples include:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** – formyl group at the para position.
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** – formyl group near carboxylate.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance interferes with effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center. Example:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – directly connected aromatic rings create steric hindrance.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Without effective chelation sites, metal coordination is weaker. Example:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine) – lacks functional groups for chelation.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **thiol groups on an aromatic ring adjacent to the carboxylate** result in a **low yield**. Aromatic thiol groups may not coordinate effectively due to delocalization of electron density. Example:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** – thiol group on aromatic ring near carboxylate.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that have **amide or acetamido groups distant from the carboxylate** result in a **low yield**. The separation reduces the likelihood of chelation with the metal center. Example:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** – acetamido group distant from carboxylate.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with extended conjugation and ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. Ketone groups can participate in chelation, and conjugation stabilizes the coordination complex. Example:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** – ketone and lactone groups adjacent to carboxylate.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains containing carboxylic acid groups**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The presence of multiple carboxylate groups enhances coordination with the metal center, facilitating effective catalyst formation through strong chelation.

   - Examples:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro** or **bromomethyl** groups, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination by stabilizing the negative charge on the oxygen atom.

   - Examples:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position** result in a **high yield**. Although amino groups are electron-donating, they can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing chelation with the metal center.

   - Example:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position other than amino groups**, such as **methyl** or **hydroxyl** groups, result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, weakening metal coordination due to decreased negative charge stabilization.

   - Examples:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, or thiol) within three carbons of the carboxylate group** result in a **high yield**. Proximal functional groups enhance chelation with the metal center, forming stable bidentate ligands.

     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, or amide) more than four carbons away from the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in chelating the metal center due to increased flexibility and entropic factors.

   - Examples:

     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length (6-8 carbons) unbranched hydrocarbon chains and no interfering functional groups** result in a **high yield**.

     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the ortho or para position** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or sterically hinder metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

   - Examples:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated carbon chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination due to reduced electron density.

    - Example:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group that lack additional coordinating sites** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance interferes with effective metal coordination, reducing catalyst formation.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky side chains containing additional nitrogen atoms capable of coordination**, such as **indole** rings, result in a **high yield**. The additional nitrogen atoms enhance metal coordination through chelation.

    - Example:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with adjacent ketone or carbonyl groups**, capable of forming chelates, result in a **high yield**. Carbonyl groups enhance coordination through the formation of stable chelate rings with the metal center.

    - Examples:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate**, such as **sugar acids**, result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, forming strong chelates with the metal center.

    - Example:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **long polyether chains attached to the carboxylate group**, such as **polyether carboxylic acids**, result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk of ether chains reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

The rule is clear (**Clarity**), but only supported by one data point (**Coverage** is minimal). The property insight is speculative (**Property Insight**). It considers specific substructures (**Complexity**).

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 suggests that amino acids with bulky side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yield. While phenylalanine (entry 13, low yield) supports this, tryptophan (entry 15) contradicts it by showing a high yield, violating the **Clarity** criterion and bringing into question the rule's validity. The property insight about steric hindrance is insufficient to explain the exception (**Property Insight**). The rule's complexity is acceptable, but inconsistent data undermines its **Coverage**.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 claims that thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids result in high yield, but 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (entry 10) shows a low yield, directly contradicting the rule and violating the **Clarity** criterion. The property insight about strong metal-thiol bonds does not align with the observed data (**Property Insight**). The rule lacks supportive data points (**Coverage**) and may oversimplify the effect of thiol groups (**Complexity**).

Rule Generator Message:
After analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical properties of the molecular modifiers, here are the refined rules that describe the relationship between the modifiers and the relative high or low yield of the reaction. These rules focus on combinations of functional groups and underlying physico-chemical properties to predict the yield outcome.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids containing both an amino group (-NH₂) and multiple carboxylic acid groups (-COOH)** within a short aliphatic chain result in a **high yield**. The presence of these groups facilitates strong bidentate or multidentate chelation with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)** groups, result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination through stronger ionic interactions.

   - Examples:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) at the para position** result in a **high yield**. The amino group can coordinate with the metal center, providing additional binding sites and stabilizing the catalyst.

   - Example:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms** and a **carboxylic acid group** result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms in the ring act as additional coordination sites with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal functional groups** (such as **amino (-NH₂)**, **hydroxyl (-OH)**, or **thiol (-SH)** groups) **within three carbons** of the carboxylic acid group result in a **high yield**. These groups enhance chelation through additional coordination sites.

   - Examples:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids** result in a **high yield**. The thiol group forms strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

   - Example:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **unsubstituted medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (carbon chain lengths of **6-8 carbons**) without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic alkyl chain may enhance interactions with the catalyst's organic framework.

   - Example:
     - **Octanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)**, **hydroxyl (-OH)**, or **methoxy (-OCH₃)** groups, result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

   - Examples:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxylic acid) result in a **low yield**. The distal position of the functional groups reduces effective chelation with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) groups conjugated to the ring** result in a **low yield**. These carbonyl groups can engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination with the metal.

    - Example:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **long polyether chains** attached to the carboxylic acid group result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance from bulky groups adjacent to the coordination site interferes with effective metal binding.

      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **peptides or amino acids with additional amide bonds** result in a **low yield**. Amide groups compete with carboxylate groups for metal coordination, reducing overall binding efficiency.

    - Example:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the ortho position** (relative to the carboxyl group) result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can reduce the availability of functional groups for metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider the physico-chemical properties that influence metal coordination and catalyst activity. They aim to predict the yield outcome based on structural features of the modifiers:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - Contain functional groups that enhance metal binding through chelation (e.g., proximal amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups).
  - Have electron-withdrawing groups that increase carboxylate acidity and coordination strength.
  - Feature heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms offering additional coordination sites.
  - Include medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without interfering functional groups, possibly enhancing hydrophobic interactions.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - Possess functional groups that decrease carboxylate acidity (electron-donating groups) or compete with carboxylate coordination (amide, distal functional groups).
  - Have bulky side chains causing steric hindrance.
  - Contain groups that may engage in side reactions or reduce availability for coordination (aldehydes, ketones, ortho-hydroxyls).
  - Feature structural elements that introduce flexibility and entropic penalties (long polyether chains).

These rules provide a framework to predict the yield outcome for new modifiers based on their structural features. By applying these rules, one can infer whether a given SMILES structure is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction.

Rule Generator Message:
After analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical properties of the molecular modifiers, here are refined rules that describe the relationship between the modifiers and the relative high or low yield of the reaction. These rules focus on combinations of functional groups and underlying physico-chemical properties to predict the yield outcome.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (five carbons or fewer) with an **amino group (-NH₂) or thiol group (-SH) within three carbons** of the carboxylic acid result in a **high yield**. These proximal functional groups enhance metal coordination through chelation.

   - Examples (**High Yield**):
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

   - Non-examples (**Low Yield**):
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **amino acids containing both an amino group (-NH₂) and additional carboxylic acid groups (-COOH)**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. Multiple acidic groups enhance coordination with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromoalkyl groups** at the **para position**, result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination.

   - Examples:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups**, such as an **amino group (-NH₂)** at the **para position**, result in a **high yield**. These groups provide additional sites for metal binding.

   - Example:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **medium to long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (six carbons or more) **without additional functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic alkyl chain may enhance interactions with the catalyst's framework.

   - Example:
     - **Octanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) that do not coordinate to metals**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)**, at the **para position** result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

   - Examples:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) groups conjugated to the ring** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or engage in side reactions.

   - Examples:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance reduces effective metal coordination.

     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without flexible linkers** result in a **low yield**. The rigid structure may limit effective coordination due to steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxylic acid) result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective for chelation.

    - Examples:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that contain **perfluoroalkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. Strong electron-withdrawing effects decrease the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

    - Example:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that contain **amide bonds or peptide linkages** result in a **low yield**. Amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for metal coordination, reducing binding efficiency.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long flexible polyether chains** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions enabling intramolecular hydrogen bonding** (e.g., **ortho** to the carboxyl group) result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of functional groups for metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (contains an electron-donating group)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, strengthening interaction with the metal center.

   - **Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxylic acid) result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in participating in chelation.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that contain **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** due to **ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups** in aromatic carboxylic acids result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of these groups for metal coordination.

**End of Rules**

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider the underlying physico-chemical properties that influence metal coordination and catalyst activity:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - Feature functional groups (amino, thiol, ketone) proximal to the carboxyl group for effective chelation.
  - Contain electron-withdrawing groups that enhance carboxylate acidity and coordination strength.
  - Include heterocyclic rings with nitrogen atoms providing additional coordination sites.
  - Have medium-length aliphatic chains without interfering functional groups, potentially enhancing hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - Possess functional groups that decrease carboxylate basicity (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains) or compete with carboxylate coordination (amide bonds).
  - Contain electron-donating groups that weaken metal coordination.
  - Have bulky or inflexible structures causing steric hindrance.
  - Feature distal functional groups ineffective for chelation.
  - Include intramolecular hydrogen bonding that reduces availability of coordinating groups.

By applying these rules, we can predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset and balance simplicity with complexity to capture the key factors affecting the reaction yield.

The rule provides strong property insight, highlighting the importance of proximity for effective chelation with metal centers, which enhances catalyst activity. It combines multiple sub-structures (functional groups and their positions) and is supported by several examples and non-examples, ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position lead to high yield. The property insight is solid, explaining how EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination. The rule effectively combines sub-structures and has acceptable coverage with pertinent examples and a non-example, maintaining a good balance between complexity and simplicity.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and focuses on heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring, resulting in high yield. It provides good property insight by emphasizing the role of nitrogen atoms as additional coordination sites. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (heterocyclic ring systems with coordinating nitrogen atoms) and is backed by multiple examples and a non-example, ensuring robust coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the para position result in high yield. While the rule is clear and offers property insight into the additional coordination capability provided by the amino group, its coverage is limited, with only one example and one non-example. Expanding the dataset to include more supporting modifiers would enhance its robustness.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 states that medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (six to eight carbons) without interfering functional groups result in high yield. The rule is clear and provides property insight by suggesting that hydrophobic alkyl chains may enhance interactions within the catalyst framework. However, coverage is minimal, with only one example and one non-example. Additional data points would improve the rule's applicability and balance.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly identifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) like methyl or methoxy at the para position result in low yield. The property insight is sound, explaining that EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and includes an exception, which adds complexity but may affect clarity slightly. Coverage is adequate, though more examples could enhance it.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, indicating that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or formyl groups conjugated to the ring result in low yield due to potential interference with metal coordination or side reactions. While the property insight is valid, coverage is limited to two examples. Including more modifiers that fit this rule would strengthen its applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 states that modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains result in low yield. The rule is clear and provides property insight into how the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces basicity, weakening coordination. However, coverage is limited to a single example, suggesting a need for more data to confirm the rule's generality.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear, explaining that modifiers with amide bonds or peptide linkages near the carboxyl group result in low yield due to competition with carboxylate coordination. It combines functional groups effectively and provides adequate property insight. Coverage is acceptable with two supporting examples, though additional data would enhance confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids with long flexible polyether chains result in low yield, attributing this to entropic factors and steric hindrance. The rule is clear with reasonable property insight. However, coverage is minimal, relying on a single example. More examples are needed to validate the rule thoroughly.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without flexible linkers result in low yield due to steric hindrance. The rule is clear with solid property insight but has limited coverage, supported by only one example. Including more data points would strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 states that modifiers with functional groups capable of chelation within conjugated systems result in high yield. While the rule provides property insight into enhanced metal binding through multiple coordination sites, it is somewhat broad, which may affect clarity. Coverage includes examples and a non-example, but the inclusion of exceptions might complicate its application.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly describes that aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups (more than three carbons away) result in low yield due to ineffective chelation. The rule offers solid property insight and has good coverage, supported by multiple examples. It effectively combines sub-structures and maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 specifies that modifiers with intramolecular hydrogen bonding from ortho-substituted hydroxyl or formyl groups result in low yield, as this reduces the availability of coordinating groups. The rule is clear, provides adequate property insight, and has acceptable coverage with two examples.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 states that amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance. The rule is clear and provides reasonable property insight but is limited in coverage, with only one supporting example. Expanding the dataset would enhance the rule's applicability.

  - **Chelation within Conjugated Systems**: Functional groups capable of chelation within conjugated systems strengthen metal coordination.
  - **Polar Side Chains**: Amino acids with hydrophilic or polar side chains can form additional interactions with the metal center.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Distal Functional Groups**: Functional groups located far from the carboxyl group are less effective for chelation and may introduce steric hindrance.
  - **Perfluoroalkyl Chains**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects reduce carboxylate basicity, weakening coordination.
  - **Aldehyde Groups**: Aldehyde groups can interfere with coordination or participate in side reactions.
  - **Bulky Structures**: Sterically hindered modifiers reduce effective metal interaction.
  - **Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding**: Reduces availability of coordinating groups like hydroxyl or formyl groups.
  - **Amide Bonds**: Compete with carboxylate for metal coordination, decreasing catalyst effectiveness.
  - **Flexible Polyether Chains**: Increase steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination due to conformational flexibility.

     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Para methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde may interfere with coordination)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring**, especially **pyridine or pyrazole rings**, result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups** result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of coordinating groups for metal binding.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
     - **2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Salicylic acid)
   - **Explanation**: The ortho position allows for strong intramolecular interactions, competing with coordination to the metal.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **fluorinated alkyl chains near the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
     - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds or peptide linkages adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. Amide groups can compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination and reduce the availability of coordination sites.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups or with hydrophobic side chains** result in a **high yield**. The lack of interfering groups and potential for hydrophobic interactions can enhance catalyst performance.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Octanoic acid**
     - **Hexanoic acid**
   - **Explanation**: Simple structures minimize steric hindrance and do not introduce competing coordination sites.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **bulky or sterically hindering groups adjacent to the coordination site**, such as **phenyl rings or large substituents**, result in a **low yield** due to decreased ability to coordinate with metal centers.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **long flexible ether chains** result in a **low yield**. The increased conformational flexibility reduces the effective concentration of coordinating groups at the metal center.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that contain **aromatic rings with conjugated systems and additional chelating groups** (e.g., **ketone or lactone groups adjacent to the ring**) result in a **high yield**. These groups can engage in multidentate coordination, strengthening metal binding.

    - **Examples (High Yield)**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups** such as **hydroxyl (-OH) or methyl (-CH₃)** result in a **low yield**. These groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, reducing coordination efficiency.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the ring and carboxylate, diminishing metal interaction.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains capable of π-interactions** (e.g., **indole rings**) result in a **high yield**. The aromatic side chains can participate in additional coordination or stabilization through π-stacking.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **functional groups capable of bridging coordination**, such as **thiol (-SH) and adjacent carboxylate groups**, result in a **high yield**. These groups facilitate stronger binding to metal centers through multidentate coordination.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles**: Heterocyclic acids with nitrogen atoms provide additional coordination sites (Rule 4).
  - **Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups**: Polyhydroxy acids offer multiple coordination points (Rule 5).
  - **Amino Acids with Indole Rings**: Aromatic side chains like indole can engage in π interactions (Rule 10).
  - **Long-Chain Aliphatic Acids**: Simple acids without interfering groups perform well (Rule 12).

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:

  - **Distant Functional Groups**: Functional groups far from the carboxyl reduce chelation effectiveness (Rule 6).
  - **Fluorinated Chains**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects weaken coordination (Rule 7).
  - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents near the carboxyl group impede coordination (Rule 8).
  - **Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding**: Ortho hydroxyl or formyl groups reduce available coordination sites (Rule 9).
  - **Formyl Substituents**: Formyl groups interfere with coordination (Rule 11).
  - **Flexible Polyether Chains**: Distant amino groups on flexible chains are less effective (Rule 13).

**Balance Between Simple and Complex Rules**:

- **Simple Rules with Broad Coverage**: Rules like 1, 2, and 6 are straightforward and cover many examples in the dataset.
- **Complex Rules with Specificity**: Rules like 10 and 13 address specific structural features impacting yield.

**Physicochemical Considerations**:

Each rule is grounded in chemical principles such as ligand coordination ability, electronic effects of substituents, steric hindrance, and the nature of metal-ligand interactions.

**Coverage and Predictive Clarity**:

The rules collectively cover the majority of the dataset, providing clear guidelines on whether a given modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural features.
