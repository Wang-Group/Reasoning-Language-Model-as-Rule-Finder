**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), or thiol (-SH) groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. These proximal polar groups enhance chelation with the metal center, improving catalyst performance.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups in the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂), bromo (-Br), or amino (-NH₂)**, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups in the para position**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)**, result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing coordination efficiency.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole rings**, result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups** result in a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups enhance chelation and coordination with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups located more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The increased distance reduces effective chelation with the metal center.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains near the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Example (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups** relative to the carboxyl group on aromatic rings result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of coordinating sites to the metal center.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with indole side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, result in a **high yield**. The indole ring may participate in π interactions with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
   - **Non-example (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The simple structure allows unimpeded coordination with the metal center.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **Octanoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **polyether chains or flexible linkers bearing amino (-NH₂) or methoxy (-OCH₃) groups distant from the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and distance reduce effective chelation with the metal center.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **aromatic rings**, result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance affecting metal coordination.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids containing formyl (-CHO) groups** result in a **low yield**. The formyl group may interfere with metal coordination or engage in intramolecular interactions.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing sulfur groups (-SH) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. Sulfur atoms enhance coordination with the metal center.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy (-OCH₃) groups in the meta or para position** result in a **high yield**. Methoxy groups can participate in electron donation, influencing metal coordination.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
    - **Non-example (Low Yield)**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
