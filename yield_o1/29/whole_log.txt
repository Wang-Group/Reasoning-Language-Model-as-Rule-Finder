- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in defining modifiers as alpha-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups resulting in high yield. It combines multiple sub-structures (alpha-amino acid backbone and side-chain carboxylic acid), demonstrating appropriate complexity. There is physical-chemical insight, as these groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. The rule is supported by at least two data points: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-glutamic acid) and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-aspartic acid), both showing high yield, satisfying coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 specifies that para-substituted benzoic acids containing an amino group result in high yield. The rule is clear and combines sub-structures (benzoic acid core with para-amino substitution), showing appropriate complexity. The amino group can enhance electron donation, providing physical-chemical insight. Supported by 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid, both yielding high yield, the rule has adequate coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 states that modifiers containing an aldehyde group result in low yield. The rule is clear but focuses on a single functional group, lacking complexity.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 6** to account for the influence of the aromatic ring on thiol groups. The current Rule 6 states that modifiers with thiol groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield. However, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, which contains a thiol group on an aromatic ring, results in low yield. Modify the rule to specify that only aliphatic thiol groups (without adjacent aromatic rings) contribute to high yield. This refinement improves accuracy by excluding aromatic thiols that negatively impact yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Combine Rules 2, 7, and 8 into a comprehensive rule about para-substituted benzoic acids**. Observations show that the nature of the para-substituent significantly affects yield:

  - Para-amino groups (electron-donating) result in high yield.
  - Para-nitro groups (electron-withdrawing) result in high yield.
  - Para-methyl and para-formyl groups result in low yield.

  Develop a new rule that correlates the electronic nature of the para-substituent with yield outcomes, considering both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Advice 3**: **Expand Rule 4 with additional data or reconsider its validity**. Currently, Rule 4 (modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield) is based on a single data point. To strengthen this rule, gather more data on similar compounds. If additional data is unavailable, consider deprioritizing this rule due to limited support.

- **Advice 4**: **Review and possibly consolidate Rules 9 and 12 concerning amide bonds**. Both rules address modifiers containing amide bonds leading to low yield:

  - Rule 9 focuses on peptidic amide bonds.
  - Rule 12 addresses amide-linked sulfur-containing side chains.

  Since amide bonds may interfere with catalyst interactions, propose a general rule that modifiers with amide bonds result in low yield unless there are overriding functional groups that enhance yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Investigate the effect of chain length in aliphatic acids**. Compounds like octanoic acid (high yield) and 7-aminoheptanoic acid (low yield) suggest that the presence of amino groups on longer aliphatic chains may reduce yield. Consider creating a new rule that modifiers which are long-chain aliphatic acids without polar side groups result in high yield, whereas the introduction of polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) decreases yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Clarify Rule 3 regarding aldehyde groups**. While Rule 3 states that modifiers containing an aldehyde group result in low yield, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid is an exception due to the presence of a hydroxyl group. Refine the rule to specify that aldehyde groups yield low results unless additional electron-donating groups (like hydroxyl) are present on the aromatic ring.

- **Advice 7**: **Strengthen Rule 8 with more data**. Rule 8 is supported by a single compound (4-nitrobenzoic acid). To validate this rule, test additional para-substituted benzoic acids with nitro groups or similar electron-withdrawing groups to confirm their effect on yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Elaborate on Rule 10 to include heterocyclic carboxylic acids**. Rule 10 currently covers pyridine carboxylic acids resulting in high yield. Given that 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid also shows high yield, expand the rule to include other heterocyclic carboxylic acids that can coordinate with metal centers.

- **Advice 9**: **Assess the role of electron-rich aromatic rings in modifiers**. Compounds like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (high yield) suggest that electron-rich aromatic rings attached to aliphatic chains may enhance yield. Propose a new rule that modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) on aromatic rings linked to aliphatic chains result in high yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Reevaluate Rule 13 with additional data**. Rule 13, concerning modifiers with hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains resulting in low yield, is based on a single compound. Acquire more data to confirm this rule or consider merging it with advice on polar groups reducing yield in long-chain aliphatic acids.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **alpha-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups** (e.g., L-glutamic acid, L-aspartic acid) result in **high yield**. These compounds have an amino group at the alpha position and additional carboxylic acid groups on their side chains, enhancing coordination with metal centers.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids containing amino or nitro groups** (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) result in **high yield**. The electron-donating amino group and electron-withdrawing nitro group at the para position influence the electronic properties, facilitating effective catalyst modification.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids containing methyl or aldehyde groups** (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid) result in **low yield**. These substituents do not favorably interact with the catalyst's active sites, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing an **aldehyde functional group** result in **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can coordinate with metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst through irreversible binding.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** (e.g., perfluorinated carboxylic acids) result in **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the ligand's ability to donate electron density to the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds** (e.g., peptides or molecules with amide linkages) result in **low yield**. Amide groups can compete with the catalyst's active sites or lead to unfavorable interactions that diminish catalytic activity.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **alkanoic acids with terminal amino groups** (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid) result in **high yield**. The terminal amino group enhances metal coordination, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids or heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** (e.g., nicotinic acid, pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) result in **high yield**. The nitrogen in the heteroaromatic ring can coordinate with metal sites, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **ether linkages and polar side chains**, such as **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties** (e.g., triethylene glycol monoacetic acid), result in **low yield**. The ether groups can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst due to their flexibility and steric effects.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains** (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) result in **low yield**. The hydroxyl groups increase polarity and may lead to undesired hydrogen bonding, affecting catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **alpha-amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains**, such as **phenylalanine**, result in **low yield**, whereas those with **heteroaromatic side chains**, like **tryptophan** (indole group), result in **high yield**. The heteroatoms in indole rings can coordinate with metals, unlike simple phenyl rings.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **thiol groups on aliphatic chains** (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) result in **high yield**, while those with **thiol groups on aromatic rings** (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid) result in **low yield**. Aliphatic thiols can effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing activity, whereas aromatic thiols may form less favorable interactions.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** without polar substituents (e.g., octanoic acid) result in **high yield**, but those with **polar substituents** like hydroxyl or amino groups on the chain (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid) result in **low yield**. Nonpolar chains favor better hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst's environment.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **aromatic ketones attached to aliphatic chains with carboxylic acid groups** (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) result in **high yield**. The ketone and methoxy groups can facilitate electronic interactions that enhance catalytic activity.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating hydroxyl groups attached via an amide linkage** (e.g., 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid) result in **low yield**. The amide linkage may interfere with proper coordination to the metal center.

The rule balances complexity and coverage well.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear, with data support from 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid, both resulting in low yield. The rule provides reasonable property insight into why certain substituents do not favorably interact with the catalyst's active sites. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific substituents, and the coverage is sufficient.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and presents property insight regarding the potential deactivation of the catalyst by aldehyde groups. It is supported by two data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—both showing low yield. While the rule is simple, it meets the coverage criterion and maintains a good balance between simplicity and applicability.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and offers property insight into the electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms. However, it is supported by only one data point—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid—resulting in low yield.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 5 due to limited data support and consider generalizing**. Since only one data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) supports the rule that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield, it's advisable to either gather more data on similar compounds or broaden the rule to include other strong electron-withdrawing groups that negatively impact yield. This generalization could enhance the rule's applicability and reliability.

- **Advice 2**: **Clarify Rule 6 by specifying the types of amide bonds affecting yield**. There appears to be inconsistency, as (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan), which contains an amide linkage, results in high yield, contradicting the rule. Refine the rule to focus on modifiers containing peptidic amide bonds or amide linkages that interfere with metal coordination, leading to low yield. Clearly delineate which amide bonds are detrimental to catalytic activity.

- **Advice 3**: **Revise Rule 7 to account for chain length and amino group positioning**. The current rule states that alkanoic acids with terminal amino groups result in high yield, but data shows inconsistency—5-aminopentanoic acid yields high, whereas 7-aminoheptanoic acid yields low. Modify the rule to specify that short-chain alkanoic acids (e.g., five carbon atoms or fewer) with terminal amino groups result in high yield. This adjustment acknowledges the impact of chain length on catalytic performance.

- **Advice 4**: **Reevaluate Rule 10 due to limited data and potential contradictions**. With only one supporting data point (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid resulting in low yield) and potential conflicting data from compounds like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (which may affect yield differently), consider gathering additional data or revising the rule. You might combine this rule with others that address the presence of hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains and their influence on yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Merge or refine Rules with limited coverage (Rules 14 and 15)**. Both rules are based on single data points, limiting their robustness. For Rule 14, consider combining it with other rules involving aromatic ketones or methoxy groups that enhance catalytic activity. For Rule 15, clarify the role of amide linkages connected to electron-donating groups and explore whether this effect is consistent across similar compounds. Expanding data coverage will strengthen these rules.

- **Advice 6**: **Ensure data consistency and verify contradictory entries**. Instances like Rule 6's contradiction (tryptophan containing an amide bond yet resulting in high yield) suggest possible data inaccuracies. Review the dataset meticulously to confirm the correctness of yield assignments. Accurate data is crucial for developing reliable rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Focus on refining well-supported rules with strong data backing**. Rules such as 2, 3, 8, 11, 12, and 13 are well-supported and provide significant property insights. Ensure these rules are clearly defined, emphasizing key structural features that influence yield. For example, highlight the importance of electron-donating or withdrawing groups at specific positions and their effects on metal coordination.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate steric and electronic effects into rule explanations**. Elaborate on how steric hindrance and electronic properties of substituents affect catalyst interaction. For instance, clarify why aliphatic thiols enhance yield due to effective metal coordination, while aromatic thiols do not, possibly due to steric hindrance or reduced sulfur availability for coordination.

- **Advice 9**: **Develop rules that consider chain length and functional group positioning**. Chain length appears to influence yield in several cases. Create rules that specify optimal chain lengths for high yield, considering both steric factors and the reachability of functional groups to coordinate with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Advice 10**: **Gather additional data to strengthen under-supported rules**. For rules currently based on limited data (e.g., Rules 5, 10, 14, and 15), prioritize the acquisition of more experimental data. Expanded datasets will allow for more accurate rule formulation and validation, increasing the reliability of the predictive model.

Rule Generator Message:
Based on the analysis of the provided dataset and considering the underlying physico-chemical properties of the modifiers, the following rules have been generated to describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the yield of the reaction:

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with additional carboxylic acid side chains**, such as **L-aspartic acid** and **L-glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The extra carboxyl groups enhance coordination with the metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar substituents** (e.g., **octanoic acid**) yield a **high yield**. These nonpolar chains favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. In contrast, similar aliphatic acids with **polar substituents** like hydroxyl or amino groups (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**) result in a **low yield** due to potential interference with catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** with nitrogen heteroatoms (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms facilitate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids** with **electron-donating amino groups** or **electron-withdrawing nitro or bromomethyl groups** (e.g., **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. These substituents modify the electronic properties of the aromatic ring to favor effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids** with **small alkyl groups** like methyl or with **aldehyde groups** (e.g., **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Such substituents do not contribute to enhanced coordination with the catalyst and may hinder catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde functional groups** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can form irreversible bonds with metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces the ligand's ability to donate electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers featuring **aliphatic thiol groups** (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**, while those with **aromatic thiol groups** (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Aliphatic thiols can effectively coordinate with metal centers, whereas aromatic thiols may form less favorable interactions.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **long ether chains** or **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties** (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether linkages may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains** such as **L-phenylalanine** result in a **low yield**, whereas those with **heteroaromatic side chains** like **L-tryptophan** (containing an indole ring) result in a **high yield**. The presence of heteroatoms in the side chain enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalytic performance.

The rule considers specific combinations of substituents and is supported by data points such as 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid (both low yield), ensuring good coverage and a balanced approach.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in indicating that modifiers containing aldehyde functional groups result in low yield. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight by noting that aldehyde groups can form irreversible bonds with metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst. The rule focuses on specific functional groups and is supported by at least two data points (4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid yielding low), demonstrating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly states that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield, providing insight into the strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms reducing coordination ability. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), indicating limited coverage. To enhance the rule's robustness, additional supporting data points are needed, suggesting a need for improved balance between coverage and complexity.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 distinctly differentiates between modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups (high yield) and aromatic thiol groups (low yield). It provides physical-chemical insight into the effective coordination of aliphatic thiols with metal centers compared to less favorable interactions of aromatic thiols. The rule considers combinations of structural features and is supported by data points like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield), demonstrating good coverage and a balanced approach.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 specifies that modifiers with long ether chains or PEG moieties result in low yield, offering insight into steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability affecting catalyst interaction. However, the rule is mainly supported by a single data point (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid yielding low), which limits its coverage. There is potential conflicting data with modifiers like 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid yielding high, indicating that the rule may require refinement and additional data to improve clarity and balance.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly differentiates amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains (low yield) from those with heteroaromatic side chains (high yield). It provides physical-chemical insight by explaining that heteroatoms in the side chain enhance coordination with metal centers. The rule combines structural elements and is supported by data points such as L-phenylalanine (low yield) and L-tryptophan (high yield), ensuring good coverage and a balanced approach.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
Based on the analysis of the provided dataset and considering the underlying physico-chemical properties of the modifiers, the following rules have been generated to describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the yield of the reaction:

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with additional carboxylic acid side chains**, such as **L-aspartic acid** and **L-glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The extra carboxyl groups enhance coordination with the metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar substituents** (e.g., **octanoic acid**) yield a **high yield**. These nonpolar chains favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. In contrast, similar aliphatic acids with **polar substituents** like hydroxyl or amino groups (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**) result in a **low yield** due to potential interference with catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** with nitrogen heteroatoms (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms facilitate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids** with **electron-donating amino groups** or **electron-withdrawing nitro or bromomethyl groups** (e.g., **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. These substituents modify the electronic properties of the aromatic ring to favor effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids** with **small alkyl groups** like methyl or with **aldehyde groups** (e.g., **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Such substituents do not contribute to enhanced coordination with the catalyst and may hinder catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde functional groups** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can form irreversible bonds with metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces the ligand's ability to donate electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers featuring **aliphatic thiol groups** (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**, while those with **aromatic thiol groups** (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Aliphatic thiols can effectively coordinate with metal centers, whereas aromatic thiols may form less favorable interactions.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **long ether chains** or **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties** (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether linkages may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains** such as **L-phenylalanine** result in a **low yield**, whereas those with **heteroaromatic side chains** like **L-tryptophan** (containing an indole ring) result in a **high yield**. The presence of heteroatoms in the side chain enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalytic performance.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Metrics Compared to Reference Metrics**

To evaluate the performance of the current rules, we'll compare the provided current metrics with the reference metrics from previous iterations, focusing on **confidence** and **lift**.

---

**1. Train Support**
- **Current:** 0.0476 (approx. 4.76%)
- **Reference Mean:** Between 0.1667 and 0.1845 (approx. 16.67% - 18.45%)

*Comment:*
The current train support is significantly lower than the reference values. This indicates that the current set of rules applies to a smaller portion of the training data compared to previous rules. While a lower support isn't inherently negative, it suggests that the rules may be too specific or not covering enough instances to be broadly impactful.

---

**2. Train Confidence**
- **Current:** 0.7444 (74.44%)
- **Reference Mean:** Between 0.5396 and 0.6352 (approx. 53.96% - 63.52%)

*Comment:*
The current train confidence is notably higher than the reference metrics. This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, the prediction is correct 74.44% of the time, which is an improvement over previous rules. A higher confidence value suggests that the rules are more reliable when they apply.

---

**3. Train Lift**
- **Current:** 1.4997
- **Reference Mean:** Between 1.0559 and 1.2048

*Comment:*
The lift of the current rules is significantly higher than the reference lifts. A lift of 1.4997 implies that the presence of the rule condition increases the probability of the rule prediction by approximately 50% compared to random chance. This indicates a strong association between the conditions and the predicted outcome.

---

**4. Train Leverage**
- **Current:** 0.0163
- **Reference Mean:** Between -0.0041 and 0.0289

*Comment:*
The current leverage is positive and within the range of the reference metrics. A positive leverage indicates that the rule's condition and prediction occur together more frequently than would be expected if they were independent.

---

**Interpretation of the Metrics**

- **Higher Confidence and Lift:** The increase in confidence and lift suggests that the current rules are more effective in accurately predicting the outcome when the rule conditions are satisfied.
- **Lower Support:** The decrease in support indicates that while the rules are more accurate, they apply to a smaller subset of the data. This could limit the overall impact of the rules.
- **Leverage Within Expected Range:** The leverage being positive and comparable to previous metrics suggests that the strength of association is acceptable but may need improvement to capture more significant relationships.

---

**Evaluation of Iteration Progress**

Based on the comparison:

- **Potential Local Minimum:** The current rules have achieved higher confidence and lift but at the cost of lower support. This trade-off may indicate that we are approaching a local minimum where further iterations using the same approach yield diminishing returns.
- **Iteration Sufficiency:** Given the significant increase in confidence and lift, it's possible that the algorithm has optimized the rules as much as possible under the current methodology. However, the low support suggests that the rules are not generalizing well across the dataset.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Enhance Rule Generalization to Increase Support:**
   - **Simplify Rule Conditions:** Review the rules to identify overly specific conditions that could be relaxed to cover more data points without significantly reducing confidence.
   - **Combine Similar Rules:** Merge rules that have overlapping conditions or predictions to create more general rules with higher support.

2. **Balance Confidence and Support:**
   - **Accept Slightly Lower Confidence for Higher Support:** Aim for rules that have slightly lower confidence but significantly higher support to increase their applicability.
   - **Set Thresholds for Metrics:** Establish acceptable minimum values for confidence and support to guide rule refinement.

3. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - **Feature Engineering:** Explore additional physico-chemical properties that may help in creating rules with higher support and acceptable confidence.
   - **Use of Hierarchical or Grouped Features:** Group modifiers based on broader categories (e.g., functional groups, hydrophobicity) to increase support.

4. **Prevent Overfitting:**
   - **Cross-Validation:** Apply cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data.
   - **Prune Overly Complex Rules:** Remove or simplify rules that contribute minimally to overall performance but add complexity.

5. **Evaluate on Test Data:**
   - **Assess Generalization:** Test the current rules on a separate test dataset to evaluate their real-world applicability.
   - **Compare Test Metrics:** Since only train metrics are provided, obtaining test metrics for confidence and lift would help identify overfitting.

6. **Iterate with Alternative Approaches:**
   - **Algorithmic Changes:** Consider using different rule induction algorithms or incorporating machine learning models that may capture more complex relationships.
   - **Expert Input:** Collaborate with domain experts to validate the relevance of the rules and suggest modifications based on chemical intuition.

---

**Conclusion**

While the current rules exhibit higher confidence and lift, indicating more accurate predictions when applicable, the significantly lower support suggests they cover fewer instances in the data. This imbalance points toward a possible local minimum in the iterative process, where further similar iterations may yield limited improvements.

To enhance the performance of the rules:

- **Aim for a Better Balance:** Adjust the rules to increase support while maintaining acceptable confidence and lift.
- **Avoid Over-Specialization:** Ensure that the rules are not overly tailored to specific cases at the expense of general applicability.
- **Continue Iterating Mindfully:** Further iterations should focus on incorporating broader conditions and additional features to improve rule coverage.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be improved to provide more comprehensive and reliable predictions, ultimately advancing the goals of the research program.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Traditional Commenter Message:
**Comments on Accuracies of the Validation and Training Sets**

The current validation accuracy achieved is approximately **74.29%**. This is slightly lower than the previous validation accuracies, which were consistently around **76%**. The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be capturing the essential features necessary for optimal prediction performance.

Comparing the current accuracy to the baseline:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies**: Consistently at **76%**
- **Current Validation Accuracy**: **74.29%**

This slight reduction indicates that the model's predictive capability has not improved with the current iteration of rules. It suggests that the current rules may not be sufficiently effective and may require refinement to enhance the model's performance.

---

**Assessment of Overfitting and Underfitting**

Given that the validation accuracy has decreased and there's no significant improvement over previous results, it appears that the model may be **underfitting**. The rules may not be complex or comprehensive enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Alternatively, if the model shows high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set (which we cannot confirm without training accuracy data), it could be overfitting.

Without evidence of a substantial increase in validation accuracy, we can infer:

- **Underfitting**: The model may be too simplistic, and the current rules might not fully encapsulate the necessary features to distinguish between high and low modifier loadings effectively.

---

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions for individual molecules. By analyzing cases where the model's predictions do not match the experimental values, we can identify which rules may be contributing to inaccuracies.

**Discrepancies Identified:**

1. **Underestimated Loadings**: Predicted loading is **low**, but the experimental value is **high**.

   - **Molecule**: *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N*
     - **Most Negative SHAP Value**: **Rule 3** (-0.1034)
   - **Molecule**: *C(CCN)CC(=O)O*
     - **Most Negative SHAP Values**: **Rule 2** (-0.1403), **Rule 3** (-0.1356)
   - **Molecule**: *COC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C(=O)CCC(=O)O)OC*
     - **Most Negative SHAP Values**: **Rule 2** (-0.1403), **Rule 3** (-0.1356)

   **Interpretation**: The significant negative SHAP values for **Rule 2** and **Rule 3** suggest that these rules are contributing to the underestimation of the modifier loading in these cases. This indicates that **Rule 2** and **Rule 3** may need to be revisited or refined to better capture the properties of molecules that are currently being underestimated.

2. **Overestimated Loadings**: Predicted loading is **high**, but the experimental value is **low**.

   - **Molecule**: *C1=CC(=CC=C1CCCCC(=O)O)O*
     - **Most Positive SHAP Value**: **Rule 2** (0.1713)
   - **Molecule**: *C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O*
     - **Most Positive SHAP Value**: **Rule 2** (0.1713)

   **Interpretation**: The significant positive SHAP value for **Rule 2** in these cases indicates that this rule is contributing to the overestimation of the modifier loading. This suggests that **Rule 2** may be too broadly defined, leading to false positives in predicting high loading.

---

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

Given that the validation accuracy has decreased slightly, the current rules may not be providing an improvement over previous iterations. The consistent mispredictions highlighted by the SHAP analysis suggest that certain rules may be negatively impacting the model's performance. The probability of improvement with the current rules seems low without further refinement.

---

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis**

The SHAP analysis indicates that:

- **Rule 2** and **Rule 3** have a significant impact on the model's predictions.
- Incorrect predictions are often associated with high magnitude SHAP values from these rules.
- Refining these rules could lead to better alignment between predicted and experimental values.

---

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

The current rules are not performing optimally, as evidenced by:

- **Slight Decrease in Validation Accuracy**: Indicates potential issues with rule effectiveness.
- **Consistent Misclassifications**: Certain molecules are consistently misclassified, suggesting that the rules do not adequately cover all cases.
- **Overfitting or Underfitting**: The model may be underfitting due to overly simplistic rules that fail to capture complex relationships in the data.

Considering the above, it appears that the model has not yet reached a local minimum, and additional iterations and refinements of the rules are necessary.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the model's performance, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Refine Rule 2**:

   - **Current Issue**: Rule 2 is too broadly applied to aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar substituents, leading to overestimation in some cases.
   - **Suggested Improvement**:
     - **Specify Chain Length**: Limit the rule to aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths within a certain range (e.g., C6-C8) that have been experimentally shown to result in high yield.
     - **Incorporate Substituent Effects**: Consider the presence of other functional groups or branching that may affect the hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst.
     - **Revised Rule 2**: "Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths between C6 and C8**, without polar substituents, result in a **high yield**. Longer or shorter chains, or presence of branching, may lead to **low yield**."

2. **Refine Rule 3**:

   - **Current Issue**: Rule 3 may not adequately account for the electronic effects of different heteroatoms and their positions within heteroaromatic rings, leading to underestimation.
   - **Suggested Improvement**:
     - **Differentiate Heteroatoms**: Distinguish between nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur heteroatoms, as they have different coordination abilities.
     - **Consider Ring Size and Substitution Patterns**: Acknowledge that the position of the carboxylic acid group and other substituents can significantly impact coordination.
     - **Revised Rule 3**: "Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** with **nitrogen heteroatoms in positions that favor metal coordination** (e.g., nitrogen adjacent to the carboxyl group) result in a **high yield**. If the nitrogen is positioned away from coordinating sites or if electron-withdrawing groups are present, the yield may be **low**."

3. **Adjust Rule Application Based on SHAP Insights**:

   - **Address Overestimated Loadings**:
     - **Rule 2**: Review cases where **Rule 2** contributes to overestimation and adjust the rule to exclude molecules that do not conform to the intended criteria.
   - **Address Underestimated Loadings**:
     - **Rule 3**: Modify the rule to better capture molecules that are being underestimated, possibly by expanding the types of heteroaromatic systems included.

4. **Introduce Additional Rules or Features**:

   - **Incorporate Steric Factors**: Consider adding rules that account for steric hindrance, which may impact the modifier's ability to interact with the catalyst.
   - **Electronic Properties**: Include parameters such as Hammett sigma values to quantify the electronic effects of substituents.
   - **Machine Learning Features**: Complement rule-based features with data-driven descriptors, such as molecular descriptors or fingerprints, to capture complex patterns.

5. **Enhance Generalization**:

   - **Expand Training Data**: Incorporate more diverse molecules in the training set to improve the model's ability to generalize.
   - **Regularization**: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting if applicable.

6. **Iteratively Test and Refine**:

   - **Validate Changes**: After modifying the rules, retrain the model and evaluate whether there is an improvement in validation accuracy.
   - **Monitor SHAP Values**: Continue using SHAP analysis to identify any new discrepancies and adjust accordingly.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules shows limitations in accurately predicting the modifier loading on the catalyst, as indicated by the decreased validation accuracy and SHAP analysis. Refining **Rule 2** and **Rule 3** based on the insights gained can potentially improve the model's performance. By making the rules more specific and considering additional molecular features, we can enhance the predictive capability and generalization of the model. Continuous iteration and validation are essential to optimize the rules and achieve better alignment with experimental observations.

Project Manager Message:
**Summary of Discussions and Suggestions for Rule Optimization**

The current analysis of the rules indicates that while there has been an improvement in the **train confidence** and **lift**, the **train support** has significantly decreased compared to previous iterations. Specifically:

- **Train Support** decreased from approximately 16-18% to 4.76%.
- **Train Confidence** increased from approximately 54-64% to 74.44%.
- **Train Lift** increased from approximately 1.05-1.20 to 1.50.

While higher confidence and lift suggest that the rules are more accurate when applicable, the low support means that they apply to a smaller portion of the data, limiting their overall effectiveness.

Additionally, the validation accuracy has slightly decreased from 76% in previous iterations to 74.29% currently. The SHAP analysis highlights that certain rules, particularly **Rule 2** and **Rule 3**, are contributing significantly to incorrect predictions. Specifically:

- **Rule 2** is contributing to overestimations (false positives) in some cases.
- **Rule 3** is contributing to underestimations (false negatives) in other cases.

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

To improve the current rules and enhance the model's performance, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Refine Rule 2: Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**

   - **Issue**: Rule 2 is too broad, leading to overestimation of yields for some modifiers.
   - **Suggestion**:
     - **Specify Chain Length**: Limit the rule to aliphatic carboxylic acids with specific chain lengths (e.g., C6-C8) that have been empirically shown to result in high yields.
     - **Consider Branching and Substituents**: Exclude or adjust for modifiers with branching or additional functional groups that may hinder interaction with the catalyst.
   - **Revised Rule 2**:
     - *Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths between C6 and C8**, without polar substituents, result in a **high yield**. Modifiers outside this specification may result in a **low yield** due to reduced hydrophobic interactions or steric hindrance.*

2. **Refine Rule 3: Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids**

   - **Issue**: Rule 3 does not fully account for the impact of heteroatom types and positions on coordination with metal centers.
   - **Suggestion**:
     - **Differentiate Between Heteroatoms**: Specify the types of heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen vs. oxygen) and their influence on metal coordination.
     - **Consider Positioning**: Emphasize the importance of heteroatom positions relative to the carboxyl group for effective coordination.
     - **Include Electronic Effects**: Account for electron-donating or withdrawing effects of substituents on the aromatic ring.
   - **Revised Rule 3**:
     - *Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group**, facilitating strong coordination with metal centers, result in a **high yield**. Modifiers where the nitrogen is not positioned to chelate effectively, or where electron-withdrawing groups reduce coordination ability, result in a **low yield**.*

3. **Adjust Other Rules Based on SHAP Analysis**

   - **Rule 6 (Aldehyde Functional Groups)**:
     - **Issue**: Rule 6 may be overly generalized, categorizing all modifiers with aldehyde groups as resulting in low yield.
     - **Suggestion**:
       - **Consider Steric and Electronic Factors**: Recognize that not all aldehyde-containing modifiers deactivate the catalyst equally; adjust the rule to reflect variations.
     - **Potential Revision**:
       - *Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups that are sterically accessible and can form strong bonds with metal centers** result in a **low yield**. If the aldehyde group is hindered or less reactive, the effect may be less pronounced.*

   - **Rule 7 (Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains)**:
     - **Issue**: Rule 7 may not account for partial fluorination or the length of the fluorinated chain.
     - **Suggestion**:
       - **Specify Degree of Fluorination**: Differentiate between fully perfluorinated chains and those with fewer fluorine atoms.
       - **Consider Chain Length**: Assess how the length of the fluorinated chain impacts the electron-withdrawing effect and coordination ability.

4. **Increase Rule Support**

   - **Simplify Overly Specific Rules**: Identify and relax overly stringent conditions in the rules to cover more data points without significantly compromising confidence.
   - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge overlapping rules to create broader categories that capture more instances.

5. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features**

   - **Functional Group Analysis**: Include rules that consider other functional groups affecting coordination, such as hydroxyl, amino, or thiol groups, and their positions.
   - **Steric Hindrance Factors**: Account for bulkiness or branching in modifiers that may impede effective interaction with the catalyst.
   - **Electronic Descriptors**: Utilize quantitative descriptors like Hammett constants to evaluate electronic effects more precisely.

6. **Validate and Iterate**

   - **Cross-Validation**: Perform cross-validation to ensure that rule adjustments improve generalization and do not lead to overfitting.
   - **Monitor Metrics**: Continuously assess train support, confidence, lift, and validation accuracy to gauge the impact of changes.
   - **Use SHAP Analysis**: Leverage SHAP values to identify which rules contribute most to incorrect predictions and adjust accordingly.

**Potential for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Yes, there is a possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current rules have low support and are not generalizing well across the dataset. By refining the rules to be more comprehensive and adjusting them based on data-driven insights (such as SHAP analysis), the model's performance can be improved while mitigating the risk of overfitting.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    Based on the analysis of the provided dataset and considering the underlying physico-chemical properties of the modifiers, the following rules have been generated to describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the yield of the reaction:

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with additional carboxylic acid side chains**, such as **L-aspartic acid** and **L-glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The extra carboxyl groups enhance coordination with the metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar substituents** (e.g., **octanoic acid**) yield a **high yield**. These nonpolar chains favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. In contrast, similar aliphatic acids with **polar substituents** like hydroxyl or amino groups (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**) result in a **low yield** due to potential interference with catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** with nitrogen heteroatoms (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms facilitate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids** with **electron-donating amino groups** or **electron-withdrawing nitro or bromomethyl groups** (e.g., **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. These substituents modify the electronic properties of the aromatic ring to favor effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids** with **small alkyl groups** like methyl or with **aldehyde groups** (e.g., **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Such substituents do not contribute to enhanced coordination with the catalyst and may hinder catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde functional groups** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can form irreversible bonds with metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces the ligand's ability to donate electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers featuring **aliphatic thiol groups** (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**, while those with **aromatic thiol groups** (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Aliphatic thiols can effectively coordinate with metal centers, whereas aromatic thiols may form less favorable interactions.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **long ether chains** or **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties** (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether linkages may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains** such as **L-phenylalanine** result in a **low yield**, whereas those with **heteroaromatic side chains** like **L-tryptophan** (containing an indole ring) result in a **high yield**. The presence of heteroatoms in the side chain enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalytic performance.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2 by Specifying Chain Length and Excluding Polar Substituents**

  - **Action**: Modify Rule 2 to focus on **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths between 6 and 8 carbons (C6-C8)** that **do not contain any polar substituents or branching**.

  - **Rationale**: This refinement limits the rule to modifiers empirically associated with high yields, such as octanoic acid, and excludes modifiers like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid, which have polar substituents leading to low yields.

  - **Revised Rule 2**:
    > **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with chain lengths of C6 to C8**, without any polar substituents or branching, result in a **high yield**. Modifiers that do not meet these criteria result in a **low yield** due to reduced hydrophobic interactions or steric hindrance affecting catalyst interaction.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rule 3 by Specifying Heteroatom Position and Electronic Effects**

  - **Action**: Update Rule 3 to emphasize **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen heteroatoms adjacent (ortho) to the carboxyl group**, facilitating effective coordination with metal centers.

  - **Rationale**: Positioning of the nitrogen atom is crucial for chelation. Modifiers where nitrogen is positioned to coordinate effectively (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) result in high yields, whereas those where nitrogen is not favorably positioned may not enhance yield.

  - **Revised Rule 3**:
    > **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where a nitrogen heteroatom is adjacent to the carboxyl group**, enhancing coordination with metal centers, result in a **high yield**. Modifiers where the nitrogen heteroatom is not positioned for effective chelation or where electron-withdrawing groups reduce coordination ability result in a **low yield**.

- **Advice 3**: **Adjust Rule 6 to Account for Steric and Electronic Factors of Aldehyde Groups**

  - **Action**: Amend Rule 6 to differentiate between aldehyde-containing modifiers based on the steric accessibility and reactivity of the aldehyde group.

  - **Rationale**: Not all aldehyde groups equally deactivate the catalyst. Sterically hindered or less reactive aldehyde groups may have a reduced impact on catalyst performance and yield.

  - **Adjusted Rule 6**:
    > **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **sterically accessible and highly reactive aldehyde functional groups** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) can form irreversible bonds with metal centers, leading to catalyst deactivation and a **low yield**. Modifiers with less accessible or less reactive aldehyde groups may not significantly affect the yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rule 7 by Specifying Degree of Fluorination and Chain Length**

  - **Action**: Modify Rule 7 to distinguish between fully perfluorinated chains and partially fluorinated chains, and consider the impact of chain length on electron-withdrawing effects.

  - **Rationale**: Fully perfluorinated chains have stronger electron-withdrawing effects, reducing ligand coordination ability more than partially fluorinated chains or shorter chains.

  - **Revised Rule 7**:
    > **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **fully perfluorinated alkyl chains with chain lengths of five carbons or more** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**) result in a **low yield** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects diminishing coordination with metal centers. Modifiers with shorter or partially fluorinated chains may have less negative impact on yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Increase Rule Support by Simplifying and Combining Rules**

  - **Action**: Review existing rules to identify overly specific conditions that can be relaxed and combine similar rules to cover more data points.

  - **Rationale**: Simplifying rules can increase train support, making them applicable to a larger portion of the dataset without significantly reducing confidence or lift.

  - **Implementation**:
    - **Combine Rules 4 and 5** into a broader rule about para-substituted benzoic acids, specifying the effect of different substituents on yield.
    - **Relax conditions** in rules where appropriate to include more modifiers that follow similar trends.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features into the Rules**

  - **Action**: Develop new rules or adjust existing ones to consider other influential functional groups, steric hindrance, and electronic effects.

  - **Rationale**: Including factors like hydroxyl, amino, or thiol groups and their positions can improve the accuracy of yield predictions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **New Rule**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with polar side chains containing hydroxyl groups** (e.g., **serine**, **threonine**) may result in a **low yield** due to competitive coordination or steric effects.
    - **Adjust Rule 10**: Specify that amino acids with **bulky hydrophobic side chains** (e.g., **L-phenylalanine**) result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance, whereas those with **smaller or heteroatom-containing side chains** (e.g., **L-tryptophan**) result in a **high yield**.

- **Advice 7**: **Utilize Electronic Descriptors and Steric Parameters**

  - **Action**: Integrate quantitative descriptors such as Hammett sigma constants for substituents and Taft steric parameters into the rule definitions.

  - **Rationale**: Quantitative descriptors provide a more precise evaluation of electronic and steric effects, enhancing rule accuracy.

  - **Implementation**:
    - Include thresholds for electronic effects (e.g., sigma values) to distinguish between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents in aromatic modifiers.
    - Consider steric bulk by incorporating steric parameters, which can help predict how substituent size affects catalyst interaction.

- **Advice 8**: **Validate Adjusted Rules with Cross-Validation and SHAP Analysis**

  - **Action**: Use cross-validation to test the revised rules and employ SHAP analysis to identify and correct any remaining sources of mispredictions.

  - **Rationale**: This iterative approach ensures that the rules generalize well to unseen data and that adjustments are effectively improving performance without overfitting.

  - **Process**:
    - **Perform k-fold cross-validation** to evaluate the robustness of the rules.
    - **Analyze SHAP values** to identify rules contributing to inaccurate predictions and refine them further if necessary.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Amino acids with acidic side chains** (i.e., containing additional carboxylic acid groups), such as **L-aspartic acid** and **L-glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The extra carboxylate groups enhance coordination with the metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

2. **Rule 2**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar substituents** (e.g., **octanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. These nonpolar chains favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. In contrast, **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents** like hydroxyl or amino groups (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**) result in a **low yield** due to potential interference with catalyst interactions.

3. **Rule 3**: **Para-substituted benzoic acids** with **electron-donating amino groups** (e.g., **4-aminobenzoic acid**) or **electron-withdrawing groups** such as **nitro** or **bromomethyl** (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. These substituents alter the electronic properties of the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal center.

4. **Rule 4**: **Para-substituted benzoic acids** with **small alkyl groups** (e.g., **4-methylbenzoic acid**) or **aldehyde groups** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Such substituents do not significantly enhance coordination with the catalyst and may hinder catalytic efficiency.

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen heteroatoms** (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms in the ring facilitate coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability.

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains**, such as **L-tryptophan** (containing an indole ring), result in a **high yield**. The presence of heteroatoms in the side chain enhances interactions with the metal center.

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains** without heteroatoms (e.g., **L-phenylalanine**) result in a **low yield**. The lack of coordinating heteroatoms reduces effective interaction with the metal centers.

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde functional groups** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst.

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**) or **fluorinated functional groups** (e.g., **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms reduce the ligand's ability to donate electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center.

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers featuring aliphatic thiol groups** (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. Aliphatic thiols can effectively coordinate with metal centers due to the high nucleophilicity of the thiol sulfur.

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aromatic thiol groups** (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The aromatic ring delocalizes the lone pair on the sulfur, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing long ether chains** or **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties** (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether linkages introduce steric hindrance and reduce the overall coordination ability of the ligand.

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups attached to aromatic rings** (e.g., **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**) can result in a **high yield** if the hydroxyl group enhances interaction with the catalyst. However, similar modifiers with hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**) result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination efficiency.

14. **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are derivatives of amino acids with additional functional groups** that can interfere with coordination (e.g., **N-acetyl-L-lysine**, **methionine derivatives**) result in a **low yield**. The added groups may sterically hinder coordination or bind irreversibly to the metal center.

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing ketone functional groups adjacent to the aromatic ring** (e.g., **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The ketone can participate in coordination, enhancing catalyst activity.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** is clear in specifying that amino acids with acidic side chains, such as L-aspartic acid and L-glutamic acid, result in a high yield. The structural description allows for easy identification of matching modifiers. The property insight is adequate, explaining that extra carboxylate groups enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance. The rule combines the amino acid backbone with acidic side chains, adding complexity by considering combinations of substructures. The dataset supports this rule with at least two data points ((2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid) showing high yield, providing good coverage.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** clearly differentiates between aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar substituents (resulting in high yield) and those with polar substituents (resulting in low yield). This clarity allows for straightforward classification of modifiers. The property insight is strong, noting that nonpolar chains favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, while polar groups may interfere. The rule adds complexity by considering both the aliphatic chain and the presence or absence of polar substituents. Coverage is well-supported in the dataset with octanoic acid (high yield) and modifiers like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid (low yield).

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** specifies that para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating amino groups or electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or bromomethyl result in high yield. The clarity is high, and modifiers can be easily identified. The property insight is adequate, as these substituents alter the electronic properties, enhancing coordination. The rule is complex, combining the benzoic acid core with specific substituents. The dataset provides coverage with modifiers like 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid showing high yield.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** clearly states that para-substituted benzoic acids with small alkyl or aldehyde groups result in low yield. The rule is straightforward and modifiers are easily classified. The property insight is sufficient, indicating that these substituents do not enhance coordination and may hinder efficiency. Complexity is present by specifying substituent types. The dataset supports this rule with 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid showing low yield.

- **Comment 5**:

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Amino acids with acidic side chains** (i.e., containing additional carboxylic acid groups), such as **L-aspartic acid** and **L-glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The extra carboxylate groups enhance coordination with the metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

2. **Rule 2**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar substituents** (e.g., **octanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. These nonpolar chains favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. In contrast, **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents** like hydroxyl or amino groups (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**) result in a **low yield** due to potential interference with catalyst interactions.

3. **Rule 3**: **Para-substituted benzoic acids** with **electron-donating amino groups** (e.g., **4-aminobenzoic acid**) or **electron-withdrawing groups** such as **nitro** or **bromomethyl** (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. These substituents alter the electronic properties of the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal center.

4. **Rule 4**: **Para-substituted benzoic acids** with **small alkyl groups** (e.g., **4-methylbenzoic acid**) or **aldehyde groups** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Such substituents do not significantly enhance coordination with the catalyst and may hinder catalytic efficiency.

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen heteroatoms** (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms in the ring facilitate coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability.

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains**, such as **L-tryptophan** (containing an indole ring), result in a **high yield**. The presence of heteroatoms in the side chain enhances interactions with the metal center.

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains** without heteroatoms (e.g., **L-phenylalanine**) result in a **low yield**. The lack of coordinating heteroatoms reduces effective interaction with the metal centers.

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde functional groups** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst.

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**) or **fluorinated functional groups** (e.g., **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms reduce the ligand's ability to donate electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center.

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers featuring aliphatic thiol groups** (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. Aliphatic thiols can effectively coordinate with metal centers due to the high nucleophilicity of the thiol sulfur.

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aromatic thiol groups** (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The aromatic ring delocalizes the lone pair on the sulfur, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing long ether chains** or **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties** (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether linkages introduce steric hindrance and reduce the overall coordination ability of the ligand.

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups attached to aromatic rings** (e.g., **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**) can result in a **high yield** if the hydroxyl group enhances interaction with the catalyst. However, similar modifiers with hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**) result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination efficiency.

14. **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are derivatives of amino acids with additional functional groups** that can interfere with coordination (e.g., **N-acetyl-L-lysine**, **methionine derivatives**) result in a **low yield**. The added groups may sterically hinder coordination or bind irreversibly to the metal center.

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing ketone functional groups adjacent to the aromatic ring** (e.g., **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The ketone can participate in coordination, enhancing catalyst activity.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 1** is not capturing amino acids with acidic side chains like L-aspartic acid and L-glutamic acid. The SMARTS pattern for the amino acid backbone (`'[NX3;H2][CX3](=O)[CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) does not correctly match standard amino acids with side chains. Update the pattern to `[NX3;H2][CX3](=O)[C@H]([CX4])[R]` where `[R]` represents a side chain containing an additional carboxylic acid group, such as `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`. This will correctly identify amino acids with acidic side chains.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Rule 3** might incorrectly match molecules because the patterns for electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups are combined. Separate the patterns for electron-donating amino groups and electron-withdrawing groups, and ensure they are specifically in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. Use atom map indices or recursive SMARTS to enforce the para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Rule 4** should specifically target para-substituted benzoic acids with small alkyl or aldehyde groups. Modify the pattern to ensure that the substituents are in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. Use SMARTS patterns that specify the para relationship, such as using ring templates with position numbering.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Rule 6** is intended to match amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains like L-tryptophan. The current pattern (`'[NX3;H2][CX3](=O)[CX4][CX4][n]'`) may not match such structures correctly. Update the pattern to `[NX3;H2][CX3](=O)[C@H]([CX4])[R]`, where `[R]` is a heteroaromatic group containing nitrogen, such as `c1cc[nH]c1` for indole rings.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Rule 13** distinguishes between hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings (high yield) and aliphatic chains (low yield). The current exclude pattern for Rule 13.2 (`'[c][OX2H]'`) may not be sufficient. Modify the exclude pattern to ensure that only aliphatic hydroxyls are matched in Rule 13.2 by using `[CX4][OX2H]` and ensure that aromatic hydroxyls are not excluded due to overlap.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Rule 14** aims to identify amino acid derivatives with interfering functional groups. The exclude patterns currently might not effectively capture all interfering groups. Expand the exclude patterns to include functional groups like acetylated amines (`[NX3][CX3](=O)`), methylated amines (`[NX3][CX4]`), or methionine derivatives (`[#16][CX3][NX3]`).

- **Suggestion 7**: Ensure that all SMARTS patterns accurately reflect the chemical structures described in the natural language rules. For example, use specific SMARTS to define perfluorinated alkyl chains in **Rule 9**, such as `[CX4]([F])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` for perfluorinated carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 8**: For **Rule 5**, which targets heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen heteroatoms, ensure that the heteroaromatic ring is directly connected to the carboxylic acid. Adjust the pattern to `[n][c]1cccc1[C](=O)[O]` to match structures like pyridine carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 9**: In the code, for each rule, ensure that the patterns and exclude_patterns are mutually exclusive and correctly implemented. For example, in **Rule 7**, verify that the exclude pattern for heteroaromatic nitrogen (`[n]`) effectively excludes amino acids with heteroatoms in the side chain.

- **Suggestion 10**: Add tests or validation steps in the code to check whether the compiled SMARTS patterns are matching the intended molecules. This can help identify patterns that do not work as expected before generating the feature matrix.

- **Suggestion 11**: For **Rule 15**, ensure that the ketone functional group adjacent to the aromatic ring is correctly identified. Use a SMARTS pattern like `[c][CX3](=O)[#6]` where the ketone carbonyl is directly attached to the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 12**: Use RDKit functionalities to specify positions on aromatic rings (ortho, meta, para) to accurately model substitution patterns in **Rules 3** and **4**.

- **Suggestion 13**: Reevaluate the logic in the code where patterns are combined with logical AND operations. For rules requiring multiple patterns to match simultaneously, make sure all conditions are required rather than any single one.

- **Suggestion 14**: For amino acids and their derivatives, consider using RDKit's built-in amino acid residue templates or substructures for more accurate matching.

- **Suggestion 15**: Ensure the code properly handles stereochemistry when necessary, such as in the case of L-amino acids, by including chiral specifications in SMARTS patterns if stereochemistry is relevant to the rule.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Descriptors**. Reformulate the current qualitative rules into quantitative descriptors that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. For instance, replace terms like "electron-donating" or "electron-withdrawing" with numerical values such as Hammett sigma constants or calculated partial charges on specific atoms. This allows for the generation of a numeric feature matrix essential for predictive modeling.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize SMARTS Patterns for Functional Group Identification**. Develop SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to identify and count specific functional groups mentioned in the rules (e.g., carboxylic acids, amino groups, thiols, fluorinated chains). This automated detection directly from SMILES strings facilitates the quantitative analysis of modifiers.

- **Advice 3**: **Compute Molecular Descriptors Reflecting Coordination Ability**. Since metal coordination is a key factor, calculate descriptors such as the number of potential donor atoms (nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur), their positions, and coordination numbers. Tools like RDKit can compute these from the SMILES strings, aiding in quantifying the coordination potential of each modifier.

- **Advice 4**: **Include Steric and Electronic Parameters**. Incorporate descriptors that account for steric hindrance (e.g., molar volume, steric bulk parameters) and electronic effects (e.g., HOMO/LUMO energies, electrostatic potentials). These descriptors help in understanding how substituents may interfere with catalyst interactions or enhance coordination.

- **Advice 5**: **Quantify Hydrophobicity and Lipophilicity**. Calculate logP or partition coefficients to quantify hydrophobic interactions mentioned in Rule 2. Hydrophobicity scales can provide insights into modifiers' tendencies to favor or disrupt interactions with the catalyst.

- **Advice 6**: **Standardize Substituent Effects Using Established Scales**. Use established substituent constants like Taft or Hammett parameters to quantify the effects of different substituents on aromatic rings (as in Rules 3 and 4). This approach translates substituent electronic effects into numerical values.

- **Advice 7**: **Develop a Scoring System or Decision Tree**. Resolve overlapping or conflicting rules by creating a scoring algorithm or decision tree that weights different molecular features based on their influence on the yield. Machine learning models can be trained using the existing dataset to assign importance to each descriptor.

- **Advice 8**: **Automate Descriptor Generation with Cheminformatics Tools**. Employ cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit, ChemAxon) to automate the calculation of molecular descriptors. This ensures consistency and efficiency in processing large datasets and facilitates the inclusion of a wide range of descriptors.

- **Advice 9**: **Expand the Dataset for Machine Learning Applications**. Enrich the dataset with additional examples to improve the robustness of statistical models. A larger dataset allows for better training of machine learning algorithms, leading to more accurate predictions and potentially uncovering new patterns not evident from the current rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Rules Through Cross-Validation**. Use statistical validation methods (e.g., cross-validation, bootstrapping) to assess the predictive power of the new quantitative rules. Iteratively refine the rules based on validation results to enhance their reliability.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Amino acids with acidic side chains** containing additional carboxylic acid groups (e.g., **L-aspartic acid**, **L-glutamic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The extra carboxylate groups enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

2. **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **strong electron-withdrawing groups** such as **nitro** or **bromomethyl** substituents (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. These substituents increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with the catalyst.

3. **Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating amino groups** (e.g., **4-aminobenzoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The amino group can coordinate with metal centers, strengthening the interaction with the catalyst.

4. **Rule 4**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde (formyl) substituents** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The aldehyde group can bind to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst.

5. **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **long hydrocarbon chains without polar substituents** (e.g., **octanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. Nonpolar chains may favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, enhancing performance.

6. **Rule 6**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **polar substituents** such as **hydroxyl** or **amino groups** on the chain (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. These polar groups may interfere with catalyst interactions or introduce steric hindrance.

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heteroaromatic rings**, such as **pyridine carboxylic acids** (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**), result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability.

8. **Rule 8**: **Amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains** (e.g., **L-tryptophan**) result in a **high yield**. The heterocyclic side chain can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

9. **Rule 9**: **Amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms** (e.g., **L-phenylalanine**) result in a **low yield**. The absence of coordinating heteroatoms reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups** (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The thiol group effectively coordinates with metal centers due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur.

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aromatic thiol groups** (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The aromatic environment delocalizes the sulfur's lone pair, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** or **fluorinated functional groups** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine reduces the ligand's ability to donate electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center.

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing long ether chains** or **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties** (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether linkages introduce steric hindrance and reduce the overall coordination ability of the ligand.

14. **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with ketone functional groups adjacent to aromatic rings** (e.g., **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The ketone group can participate in coordination, enhancing catalyst activity.

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups attached to aromatic rings** (e.g., **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The hydroxyl group can enhance coordination with the catalyst. In contrast, **hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains** (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**, possibly due to decreased coordination efficiency.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Rule Coverage**: Ensure that each rule is supported by multiple data points to improve reliability. For rules with limited coverage (e.g., Rule 3, Rule 5, Rule 8, Rule 9, Rule 10, Rule 11, Rule 12, Rule 14), consider combining them with similar rules or expanding them to include additional modifiers that fit the structural criteria.

- **Advice 2**: **Merge Similar Rules**: Combine rules that address related structural features to reduce redundancy and improve clarity. For example, merge Rule 2 and Rule 3, as both involve **aromatic carboxylic acids** with substituents that enhance coordination through electronic effects. A combined rule could state that **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) result in high yield**.

- **Advice 3**: **Address Exceptions in Rules**: Refine rules by accounting for exceptions or conflicting data. For instance, in Rule 7, while most **nitrogen heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** result in high yield, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** results in low yield. Modify the rule to specify structural contexts where the nitrogen heteroaromatic ring is directly attached to the carboxylic acid without additional aromatic rings that may hinder coordination.

- **Advice 4**: **Clarify Structural Descriptions**: Improve the specificity of rules by detailing structural features. In Rule 13, specify the length of ether chains or the molecular weight of PEG moieties that lead to steric hindrance. This will make the rule more precise and applicable.

- **Advice 5**: **Expand on Property Insights**: Provide deeper chemical rationale within the rules to strengthen their basis. For example, in Rule 15, explain that hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings can engage in π-coordination with metal centers, enhancing yield, whereas on aliphatic chains, they do not facilitate such interactions due to lack of conjugation.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Functional Group Interplay**: Consider how multiple functional groups within a modifier may interact to affect yield. For modifiers with conflicting features (e.g., both coordinating and hindering groups), adjust the rules to reflect the dominant effect or create sub-rules that address these complexities.

- **Advice 7**: **Use SMILES Notation for Precision**: Utilize SMILES annotations to define the structural patterns in rules precisely. This will facilitate computational screening of modifiers and ensure consistent interpretation of the rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Reevaluate Rules with Limited Data**: For rules supported by a single data point (e.g., Rule 5, Rule 8, Rule 9, Rule 10, Rule 11, Rule 12, Rule 14), seek additional data to confirm their validity. If additional data are unavailable, consider integrating these rules into broader ones or marking them as provisional.

- **Advice 9**: **Prioritize High-Impact Rules**: Focus on refining rules that cover a larger number of modifiers and have significant impact on yield. Ensure these high-priority rules are accurate, well-supported, and clearly articulated.

- **Advice 10**: **Include Counterexamples in Rules**: Strengthen rules by mentioning known counterexamples and specifying conditions under which exceptions occur. This will enhance the predictive power and reliability of the rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Amino acids with acidic side chains** containing additional carboxylic acid groups (e.g., **L-aspartic acid**, **L-glutamic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The extra carboxylate groups enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

2. **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **strong electron-withdrawing groups** such as **nitro** or **bromomethyl** substituents (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. These substituents increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with the catalyst.

3. **Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating amino groups** (e.g., **4-aminobenzoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The amino group can coordinate with metal centers, strengthening the interaction with the catalyst.

4. **Rule 4**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde (formyl) substituents** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The aldehyde group can bind to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst.

5. **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **long hydrocarbon chains without polar substituents** (e.g., **octanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. Nonpolar chains may favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, enhancing performance.

6. **Rule 6**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **polar substituents** such as **hydroxyl** or **amino groups** on the chain (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. These polar groups may interfere with catalyst interactions or introduce steric hindrance.

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heteroaromatic rings**, such as **pyridine carboxylic acids** (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**), result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability.

8. **Rule 8**: **Amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains** (e.g., **L-tryptophan**) result in a **high yield**. The heterocyclic side chain can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

9. **Rule 9**: **Amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms** (e.g., **L-phenylalanine**) result in a **low yield**. The absence of coordinating heteroatoms reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups** (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The thiol group effectively coordinates with metal centers due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur.

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aromatic thiol groups** (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The aromatic environment delocalizes the sulfur's lone pair, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** or **fluorinated functional groups** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine reduces the ligand's ability to donate electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center.

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing long ether chains** or **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties** (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether linkages introduce steric hindrance and reduce the overall coordination ability of the ligand.

14. **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with ketone functional groups adjacent to aromatic rings** (e.g., **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The ketone group can participate in coordination, enhancing catalyst activity.

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups attached to aromatic rings** (e.g., **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The hydroxyl group can enhance coordination with the catalyst. In contrast, **hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains** (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**, possibly due to decreased coordination efficiency.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: Modify the way `count_threshold` is implemented in the code. Currently, it relies on matching the string obtained from `pat.GetSmarts()` with the keys in `count_threshold`. However, `pat.GetSmarts()` may return a canonicalized SMARTS string that does not match the original string used as the key. To fix this, associate the count threshold directly with the compiled pattern object. For example, update the rule definitions to include the count threshold alongside the compiled patterns:

  ```python
  # When compiling patterns
  compiled_group = []
  for p in group:
      pat = Chem.MolFromSmarts(p)
      threshold = rule.get('count_threshold', {}).get(p, None)
      compiled_group.append({'pattern': pat, 'threshold': threshold})
  ```

  Then, during matching, use this threshold directly:

  ```python
  for pat_dict in compiled_group:
      pat = pat_dict['pattern']
      threshold = pat_dict['threshold']
      matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(pat)
      if matches:
          if threshold:
              if len(matches) >= threshold:
                  group_match = True
                  break
          else:
              group_match = True
              break
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: Ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately reflect the functional groups described in the rules. For example, for Rule 1, verify that the `carboxylic_acid` and `amino_group` patterns correctly identify additional carboxylic acid groups and amino groups in amino acids with acidic side chains. Adjust the SMARTS if necessary:

  ```python
  # Possible correction for carboxylic acid to capture both neutral and deprotonated forms
  carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 3**: Review and adjust the logic for pattern matching to ensure that all required patterns are correctly combined. In the current code, each group in `patterns` is treated as an 'AND' condition, and within each group, patterns are treated as 'OR'. Make sure this logic aligns with the intended rule. If a rule requires multiple patterns to be present together (an 'AND' condition), they should be placed in separate groups within `patterns`.

- **Suggestion 4**: For Rule 5 and similar rules that involve exclusion criteria, ensure that `exclude_patterns` are correctly implemented. The code should first check for the presence of required patterns and then confirm the absence of any exclude patterns. Adjust the order and logic of these checks if necessary.

- **Suggestion 5**: Add informative debug statements to trace the pattern matching process. For example, after attempting to match each pattern, print whether it was successful. This can help identify where patterns are not matching as expected:

  ```python
  # After matching a pattern
  if matches:
      print(f"SMILES {smi}: Pattern {p} matched {len(matches)} times.")
  else:
      print(f"SMILES {smi}: Pattern {p} did not match.")
  ```

- **Suggestion 6**: Verify that the SMARTS patterns for substituents are correctly specified. For example, for Rule 2, ensure that `nitro_group` and `bromomethyl_group` accurately represent nitro and bromomethyl substituents attached to aromatic rings. Adjust the SMARTS patterns if they are too restrictive or not specific enough.

- **Suggestion 7**: Double-check the handling of stereochemistry in the SMARTS patterns and molecule parsing. Some amino acids and other molecules may have stereochemistry specified, which can affect pattern matching. Use `Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi, sanitize=False)` and then sanitize the molecule to preserve stereochemistry:

  ```python
  mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi, sanitize=False)
  Chem.SanitizeMol(mol)
  ```

- **Suggestion 8**: Reevaluate the matching logic for Rules 15 and 16 (originally Rule 15 and 15b). Ensure that the code distinguishes between hydroxyl groups attached to aromatic rings and those on aliphatic chains. Adjust the SMARTS patterns `aromatic_hydroxyl_group` and `aliphatic_hydroxyl_group` to accurately capture these differences.

- **Suggestion 9**: After implementing these changes, regenerate the feature matrix and manually verify that the rules are correctly applied to the SMILES list. Compare the updated matrix with expected outcomes based on the chemical structures of the modifiers and the rules.

**Performance Analysis of Current Rules Based on Current Metrics**

Upon evaluating the current rule metrics in comparison to the reference metrics, several key observations emerge that focus on **confidence** and **lift**, which are critical indicators of rule performance.

---

**1. Support**

- **Reference Metrics**:
  - *Train support*: Approximately **0.1667** to **0.1845**.
- **Current Metrics**:
  - *Train support*: **0.0357**.

**Analysis**:
- The **train support** has significantly decreased from an average of around **17.55%** in previous iterations to **3.57%** in the current iteration.
- **Implication**: The current rules apply to a much smaller fraction of the training data, indicating increased specificity but reduced general applicability.

---

**2. Confidence**

- **Reference Metrics**:
  - *Train confidence*: Approximately **0.5396** to **0.6352**.
- **Current Metrics**:
  - *Train confidence*: **0.7031**.

**Analysis**:
- The **train confidence** has increased from an average of about **58.74%** to **70.31%**.
- **Implication**: When the rule conditions are met, there is now a higher likelihood that the predicted outcome (e.g., high yield) is observed. This indicates improved accuracy of the rules for the instances they cover.

---

**3. Lift**

- **Reference Metrics**:
  - *Train lift*: Approximately **1.0559** to **1.2048**.
- **Current Metrics**:
  - *Train lift*: **1.4033**.

**Analysis**:
- The **train lift** has increased from an average of around **1.1304** to **1.4033**.
- **Implication**: The rules are better at predicting the outcome compared to random chance. A lift greater than 1 signifies a positive association between the rule conditions and the predicted outcome, and the increased value suggests stronger predictive power.

---

**4. Leverage**

- **Reference Metrics**:
  - *Train leverage*: Approximately **-0.0041** to **0.0289**.
- **Current Metrics**:
  - *Train leverage*: **0.0065**.

**Analysis**:
- The **train leverage** remains within the range observed in previous iterations but has decreased from the average of **0.0124** to **0.0065**.
- **Implication**: There is still a positive association between the rule conditions and the predicted outcome, but the strength of this association has slightly diminished.

---

**Interpretation of the Metrics**

The current rules exhibit a trade-off between **support** and **confidence/lift**:

- **Increased Confidence and Lift**:
  - The rules are more accurate when they apply, and the predictions are more significant compared to random chance.
  - This suggests that the rules have become better at identifying instances where the predicted outcome is likely to occur.

- **Decreased Support**:
  - The rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset, implying they are more specialized.
  - This could limit the practical utility of the rules, as they may not generalize well to new or broader datasets.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

Given the current trend in metrics:

- **Local Minimum**:
  - The significant increase in confidence and lift, coupled with the decrease in support, indicates that the optimization process may be converging to a local minimum.
  - The improvement in predictive power is achieved at the expense of applicability to a larger dataset.

- **Iterations**:
  - If the goal is to maximize confidence and lift without regard to support, further iterations may continue to refine these metrics but will likely further reduce support.
  - Considering practical applications, the reduction in support suggests diminishing returns from additional iterations focused solely on these metrics.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the current rules and address the observed trade-offs, consider the following strategies:

**1. Balance Between Support and Confidence**

- **Broaden Rule Conditions**:
  - Re-evaluate the specificity of the current rules.
  - Identify opportunities to generalize conditions so that they cover a larger portion of the dataset without substantially compromising confidence.

- **Example**:
  - Combine similar rules that target specific substituents into a broader category (e.g., "aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups") to increase support.

**2. Analyze Low-Support Rules**

- **Rule Relevance**:
  - Determine if the rules with very low support are capturing rare but significant patterns or are overfitting to noise.
  - Consider removing or modifying rules that do not contribute meaningfully to overall predictive performance.

**3. Enhance Rule Applicability**

- **Incorporate Additional Data Features**:
  - Introduce new variables that may help capture broader trends (e.g., steric factors, solvent effects, reaction conditions).
  
- **Leverage Domain Knowledge**:
  - Utilize chemical expertise to identify functional groups or molecular properties that are influential but not currently included in the rules.

**4. Evaluate Overfitting Risk**

- **Cross-Validation**:
  - Use cross-validation techniques to assess the generalizability of the rules.
  - Ensure that the increased confidence and lift are not a result of overfitting to the training data.

**5. Reassess Rule Formulation**

- **Simplify Complex Rules**:
  - Rules with multiple specific conditions may be too narrow.
  - Simplifying these rules can increase support while maintaining reasonable confidence levels.

- **Hierarchical Rule Structuring**:
  - Organize rules in a hierarchical manner, starting with general rules and refining with more specific sub-rules as necessary.

**6. Monitor Iteration Progress**

- **Set Metric Thresholds**:
  - Define acceptable ranges for support, confidence, and lift that align with the project's objectives.
  - Terminate iterations when improvements in confidence and lift lead to support falling below a critical threshold.

---

**Conclusion**

The analysis indicates that while the current rules have improved in terms of confidence and lift, the substantial decrease in support suggests a need for rebalancing. To enhance the practical value of the rules:

- **Aim for a Balanced Metric Profile**:
  - Strive for rules that have high confidence and lift but also maintain sufficient support to be broadly applicable.
  
- **Refine Rule Development Strategy**:
  - Adjust the focus from solely improving confidence and lift to also include support in the optimization criteria.
  
- **Iterative Improvement with Feedback**:
  - Incorporate feedback from these analyses into the rule development process.
  - Continuously monitor how changes impact all key metrics to find the optimal balance.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can become more effective in predicting outcomes across a wider range of data, enhancing their utility in the catalytic research program.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**1. Evaluation of Accuracies**

**Comparison with Previous Metrics:**

- **Previous Validation Accuracies:** The validation accuracies in previous iterations ranged from **0.68 to 0.76**, with test accuracies of **0.625 to 0.75**. This indicates that the model was performing with relatively consistent accuracy levels in earlier iterations.

- **Current Validation Accuracy:** The latest 5-fold validation accuracy is **0.6571**, which is a noticeable decrease from the previous validation accuracies.

**Interpretation:**

- The reduction in validation accuracy suggests that the modifications made to the rules or feature matrix in the current iteration have not improved the model's predictive performance. In fact, it appears that the changes may have introduced factors that reduce the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data.

**2. Analysis Based on SHAP Values**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values help identify the contribution of each feature (rule) to the model's predictions for individual instances.

**Discrepancies Between Predictions and Experimental Values:**

Out of **35 molecules** analyzed:

- **Correct Predictions:** 23 molecules
- **Incorrect Predictions:** 12 molecules

The overall accuracy aligns with the validation accuracy of **0.6571**.

    - **Most Positive SHAP Values:** **Rule 16** (0.3804), **Rule 15** (0.0607), **Rule 12** (0.0444)

**Insights:**

- **Rule 6** consistently contributes to underestimations and overestimations. It has the most negative SHAP values when the model underestimates and the most positive SHAP values when overestimating.

- **Rule 8** also contributes significantly to misclassifications, particularly in overestimations.

- **Rule 15** shows a strong negative SHAP value in at least one underestimation case (Molecule C1=CC(=CC=C1CCCCC(=O)O)O) and contributes positively in some overestimation cases.

- **Rule 16** appears in SHAP values but is not defined in the current rules provided. This discrepancy needs to be addressed to fully interpret its impact.

**3. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Underfitting Indication:** The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the model may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively, indicating possible underfitting.

- **Overfitting Consideration:** Given that the model's accuracy has decreased after adjusting the rules, it's possible that incorporating too many or ineffective rules has caused the model to perform poorly on validation data.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Changes**

- **Decrease in Accuracy:** The accuracy drop from approximately **74% to 66%** suggests that the current changes to the rules have not improved the model and may have introduced inaccuracies.

- **Potential Causes:** The new or modified rules may not be generalizing well to unseen data, possibly due to overfitting to specific patterns in the training data or introducing conflicting rules.

**5. Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule 6 is Problematic:**

  - **Definition:** **Rule 6** states: *Aliphatic carboxylic acids with **polar substituents** such as **hydroxyl** or **amino groups** on the chain result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Issue:** Rule 6 has significant negative SHAP values in underestimations and positive SHAP values in overestimations, indicating that it may be misguiding the model in crucial cases.

- **Rule 8 Needs Re-evaluation:**

  - **Definition:** **Rule 8** states: *Amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Issue:** Rule 8 contributes to overestimation in some cases, suggesting that it may be too broadly defined or not sufficiently specific.

- **Rule 15’s Contradictory Behavior:**

  - **Definition:** **Rule 15** differentiates between modifiers with hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings (**high yield**) and those on aliphatic chains (**low yield**).

  - **Issue:** Rule 15 shows both strong positive and negative SHAP values in different cases, indicating inconsistency in its predictive power.

**6. Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

- **Effectiveness of Current Rules:** The current rules are not sufficiently effective, as indicated by the decrease in validation accuracy and the misclassifications identified.

- **Local Minimum Consideration:** The performance metrics suggest that the model may have reached a local minimum where further refinements to the current set of rules are not improving the model.

- **Need for Rule Revision:** The inconsistencies and significant SHAP contributions from certain rules highlight the need for revising or refining these rules to enhance model performance.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Revise Rule 6**

- **Current Issue:** Rule 6 is contributing negatively in cases where the experimental yield is high but predicted low, and positively where the experimental yield is low but predicted high.

- **Suggested Action:**

  - **Re-evaluate the Scope:** Consider narrowing the definition to specify which polar substituents or chain lengths lead to low yields.

  - **Incorporate Exceptions:** Identify and include exceptions where polar substituents on certain aliphatic chains may result in high yields.

  - **Example Modification:**

    - *"Aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents such as hydroxyl or amino groups on **short chains (less than 5 carbons)** result in a low yield."*

**2. Refine Rule 8**

- **Current Issue:** Rule 8 is causing overestimations, indicating that not all amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains result in high yields.

- **Suggested Action:**

  - **Increase Specificity:** Specify which heteroaromatic side chains are effective.

  - **Consider Structural Factors:** Include considerations for steric hindrance or electronic effects that may affect coordination.

  - **Example Modification:**

    - *"Amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., indole ring in L-tryptophan) result in a high yield, provided there is minimal steric hindrance near the coordination site."*

**3. Re-assess Rule 15**

- **Current Issue:** Rule 15 demonstrates contradictory contributions, suggesting that the distinction between hydroxyl groups on aromatic versus aliphatic chains may not be sufficient.

- **Suggested Action:**

  - **Include Electronic Effects:** Consider the position of the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring (ortho, meta, para) and its influence on coordination.

  - **Clarify Conditions:** Define more precise conditions under which hydroxyl groups enhance coordination.

  - **Example Modification:**

    - *"Modifiers with hydroxyl groups in the para position on aromatic rings result in a high yield due to optimal coordination, while those with hydroxyl groups in other positions or on aliphatic chains result in a low yield."*

**4. Address Missing or Undefined Rules**

- **Issue with Rule 16:** The presence of SHAP values for Rule 16 without a corresponding definition indicates incomplete rule integration.

- **Action:**

  - **Define Rule 16:** Ensure that all rules contributing to the model are clearly defined.

  - **Review Rule Integration:** Verify that all rules used in feature generation are accounted for and correctly implemented.

**5. Mitigate Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Simplify the Rule Set:** Reduce complexity by removing or consolidating rules that have minimal impact or contribute to misclassifications.

- **Cross-Validation:** Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

- **Regularization Techniques:** Apply regularization methods to penalize overly complex models.

**6. Utilize SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement**

- **Identify Consistently Problematic Rules:** Use SHAP values to focus on rules that frequently contribute to incorrect predictions.

- **Iterative Testing:** After modifying rules, re-evaluate the model to assess improvements, using SHAP analysis to guide further refinements.

- **Collaborative Review:** Engage domain experts to validate the revised rules and ensure they align with chemical understanding.

**7. Incorporate Additional Features**

- **Chemical Descriptors:** Include more quantitative descriptors (e.g., pKa, molecular orbital energies) to capture nuanced chemical behaviors.

- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Experiment with different algorithms that may capture complex interactions better than the current model.

---

**Conclusion**

The analysis indicates that certain rules, particularly Rule 6 and Rule 8, are negatively impacting the model's performance. By refining these rules to be more specific and addressing inconsistencies, we can improve the model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, ensuring that all rules are properly defined and integrated will help prevent confusion and enhance the model's reliability. Incorporating these recommendations should lead to a better-performing model that aligns more closely with experimental observations.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

---

**Overview**

The primary objective is to optimize and control the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols. The reaction involves di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (DBAD) as the substrate, catalyzed by FeCl₃, and the performance is influenced by various molecular modifiers. Key parameters affected by these modifiers include:

- **Modifier loading on the catalyst (modifier/SBU)**
- **Fraction of Fe to Hf in the catalyst (Fe/Hf)**
- **Total loading of Fe (Fe_loading)**

**Current Rule Assessment**

An analysis of the existing rules, their performance metrics, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values has highlighted some critical issues:

1. **Decrease in Support**

   - **Observation**: The train support has significantly decreased from approximately 17.5% in previous iterations to 3.57% currently.
   - **Implication**: The rules have become too specialized, applying to a smaller fraction of the dataset, which limits their practical utility.

2. **Increase in Confidence and Lift**

   - **Observation**: The train confidence has increased to 70.31%, and the lift to 1.4033.
   - **Implication**: When the rules apply, they are more accurate than before, but this comes at the cost of reduced applicability.

3. **Decrease in Validation Accuracy**

   - **Observation**: The validation accuracy has dropped from previous levels (~76%) to 65.71%.
   - **Implication**: The model's ability to generalize and predict outcomes accurately has diminished.

4. **SHAP Analysis Highlights Issues with Specific Rules**

   - **Rule 6**: Contributes to both underestimations and overestimations, indicating it's misclassifying key molecules.
   - **Rule 8**: Causes overestimations, suggesting it may be too broadly defined.
   - **Rule 15**: Displays contradictory behavior with both positive and negative contributions, indicating inconsistency.
   - **Undefined Rule 16**: Referenced in SHAP values but lacks definition, leading to potential gaps in the model.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

---

1. **Refine Problematic Rules**

   **Rule 6: Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Polar Substituents**

   - **Issue**: The rule is too general, leading to misclassification.
   - **Recommendation**:
     - **Specify Chain Length**: Limit the rule to short-chain acids (e.g., less than 5 carbons).
     - **Define Substituents**: Clarify which polar groups (e.g., primary amines vs. secondary amines) impact yield.
     - **Revised Rule**:
       - *"Aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents such as hydroxyl or amino groups on short chains (less than 5 carbons) result in a low yield due to steric hindrance and interference with catalyst coordination sites."*

   **Rule 8: Amino Acids with Heteroaromatic Side Chains**

   - **Issue**: Overestimating yield for some modifiers.
   - **Recommendation**:
     - **Increase Specificity**: Identify which heteroaromatic side chains (e.g., indole, imidazole) are effective.
     - **Consider Steric Effects**: Account for steric hindrance that may reduce coordination.
     - **Revised Rule**:
       - *"Amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains containing nitrogen atoms (e.g., tryptophan with an indole ring) result in a high yield, provided there is minimal steric hindrance near the coordination site."*

   **Rule 15: Hydroxyl Groups on Aromatic Rings and Aliphatic Chains**

   - **Issue**: Contradictory contributions to predictions.
   - **Recommendation**:
     - **Clarify Position Effects**: Differentiate based on the position of the hydroxyl group (ortho, meta, para).
     - **Revised Rule**:
       - *"Modifiers with para-substituted hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings enhance coordination with the catalyst, resulting in a high yield. In contrast, hydroxyl groups in other positions or on aliphatic chains may not provide this benefit and can result in a low yield."*

2. **Define and Integrate Missing Rule**

   **Rule 16**

   - **Issue**: SHAP values reference Rule 16, but it lacks a definition.
   - **Recommendation**:
     - **Define Rule 16**: Investigate patterns in misclassified molecules to identify missing considerations.
     - **Possible Definition**:
       - *"Modifiers with electron-rich heterocycles (e.g., pyrrole, furan) that can coordinate with the metal center enhance catalyst performance, resulting in a high yield."*

3. **Adjust SMARTS Patterns and Matching Logic**

   - **Issue**: Potential mismatches in pattern recognition due to canonicalization and pattern specificity.
   - **Recommendations**:
     - **Directly Associate Count Thresholds with Compiled Patterns**: Modify the code to attach thresholds to pattern objects to ensure correct matching.
     - **Verify SMARTS Patterns**: Ensure patterns accurately reflect the intended functional groups, adjusting for canonicalization issues.
     - **Implement Logical Groupings**: Use 'AND' and 'OR' logic appropriately to reflect the intended rule conditions.

4. **Balance Between Support and Confidence**

   - **Issue**: High confidence but low support limits applicability.
   - **Recommendations**:
     - **Broaden Rule Applicability**: Slightly generalize overly specific rules to cover more molecules without significantly reducing confidence.
     - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge overlapping rules to simplify the rule set and increase support.

5. **Enhance Rule Applicability with Additional Features**

   - **Chemical Descriptors**: Incorporate quantitative features like pKa, hydrophobicity (LogP), or steric parameters to capture nuances not addressed by current rules.
   - **Machine Learning Models**: Use algorithms capable of handling complex interactions to complement the rule-based approach.

6. **Continuous Evaluation with SHAP Analysis**

   - **Iterative Refinement**: Use SHAP values to identify and correct rules that negatively impact predictions.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Employ cross-validation techniques to ensure that changes improve generalizability.

**Judgment on Further Optimization Potential**

---

There is a clear **possibility for further optimization** of the current rules without overfitting. The analysis shows that:

- Misclassifications are linked to specific rules that can be refined.
- Adjusting rule definitions and patterns can improve both support and confidence.
- Incorporating additional features and careful adjustment of patterns can enhance the model's predictive power.
- Ensuring all rules are properly defined (e.g., Rule 16) will fill gaps in the current model.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Amino acids with acidic side chains** containing additional carboxylic acid groups (e.g., **L-aspartic acid**, **L-glutamic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The extra carboxylate groups enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

2. **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **strong electron-withdrawing groups** such as **nitro** or **bromomethyl** substituents (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. These substituents increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with the catalyst.

3. **Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating amino groups** (e.g., **4-aminobenzoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The amino group can coordinate with metal centers, strengthening the interaction with the catalyst.

4. **Rule 4**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde (formyl) substituents** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The aldehyde group can bind to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst.

5. **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **long hydrocarbon chains without polar substituents** (e.g., **octanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. Nonpolar chains may favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, enhancing performance.

6. **Rule 6**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **polar substituents** such as **hydroxyl** or **amino groups** on the chain (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. These polar groups may interfere with catalyst interactions or introduce steric hindrance.

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heteroaromatic rings**, such as **pyridine carboxylic acids** (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**), result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability.

8. **Rule 8**: **Amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains** (e.g., **L-tryptophan**) result in a **high yield**. The heterocyclic side chain can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

9. **Rule 9**: **Amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms** (e.g., **L-phenylalanine**) result in a **low yield**. The absence of coordinating heteroatoms reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups** (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The thiol group effectively coordinates with metal centers due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur.

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aromatic thiol groups** (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The aromatic environment delocalizes the sulfur's lone pair, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** or **fluorinated functional groups** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine reduces the ligand's ability to donate electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center.

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing long ether chains** or **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties** (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether linkages introduce steric hindrance and reduce the overall coordination ability of the ligand.

14. **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with ketone functional groups adjacent to aromatic rings** (e.g., **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The ketone group can participate in coordination, enhancing catalyst activity.

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups attached to aromatic rings** (e.g., **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The hydroxyl group can enhance coordination with the catalyst. In contrast, **hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains** (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**, possibly due to decreased coordination efficiency.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing carboxylic acid groups with additional coordinating functional groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains** result in a **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**, **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**, and **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The presence of these groups enhances coordination with the metal center, improving catalyst performance.

2. **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents**, such as **nitro** or **halogen** groups (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**), result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the catalyst.

3. **Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents**, such as **methyl**, **hydroxyl**, or **alkoxy** groups (e.g., **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**), result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing coordination efficiency with the metal center.

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms directly attached to the carboxylic acid**, such as **pyridine** or **pyrazole** rings (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**), result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability.

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking polar substituents**, specifically those with longer hydrocarbon chains (e.g., **octanoic acid**), result in a **high yield**. The nonpolar nature may favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, enhancing performance.

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic carboxylic acids containing polar substituents**, such as **hydroxyl**, **amino**, or **ether** groups on the chain (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**), result in a **low yield**. These polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or interfere with effective coordination to the catalyst.

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aliphatic thiol groups** (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The thiol group is a strong coordinating ligand due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur, enhancing interaction with the metal center.

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing aromatic thiol groups** (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The aromatic environment delocalizes the sulfur's lone pair electrons, reducing its ability to effectively coordinate with the metal center.

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) functional groups attached to aromatic rings** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can bind to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst or competing with the desired coordination sites.

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains**, such as **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), result in a **high yield**. The heterocyclic side chain contains nitrogen that can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** or **fluorinated functional groups** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**) result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces the ligand's ability to donate electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center.

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing long polyether chains** or **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties** (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**), result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether linkages introduce steric hindrance and reduce the overall coordination ability of the ligand.

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with ketone or carbonyl functional groups adjacent to aromatic systems** (e.g., **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The carbonyl groups can participate in coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity.

14. **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone** (e.g., **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**), result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance solubility and offer additional coordination sites with the catalyst.

15. **Rule 15**: **Amino acids with non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains lacking heteroatoms**, such as **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), result in a **low yield**. The absence of coordinating functional groups reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify Rules Using Molecular Descriptors**  
  Reframe the existing rules to rely on quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. Utilize features such as the number of specific functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amines, hydroxyls), counts of heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, sulfur), ring types (aromatic, heteroaromatic), and the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents. This quantification facilitates the generation of a numeric feature matrix suitable for computational analysis.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Similar Rules to Reduce Complexity**  
  Merge rules that address similar structural features to create a more concise rule set. For instance, combine rules related to electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic systems (Rules 2 and 11) and those concerning electron-donating groups (Rules 3 and 12). This consolidation minimizes redundancy and enhances the clarity of the rules, making them easier to apply computationally.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Physicochemical Properties into Rules**  
  Augment the rules with physicochemical properties such as pKa, logP, molecular weight, and polar surface area. These properties can be calculated from SMILES strings and provide insight into how modifiers influence catalytic activity through electronic and steric effects. For example, acidic modifiers with lower pKa values may coordinate more effectively with metal centers, leading to higher yields.

- **Advice 4**: **Utilize Structural Fingerprints and Machine Learning**  
  Generate structural fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) for each modifier to create a binary feature matrix. Apply machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and relationships between modifier structures and reaction yields. This data-driven approach can reveal subtle features not captured by the existing rules and inform the development of new, more predictive rules.

- **Advice 5**: **Prioritize Easily Computable Features for Automation**  
  Focus on features that can be automatically extracted from SMILES strings without manual intervention. Properties like the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, topological polar surface area, and counts of specific atom types can be computed using cheminformatics libraries (e.g., RDKit). Automating feature extraction ensures scalability and consistency in rule application.

- **Advice 6**: **Refine Rules Based on Statistical Significance**  
  Assess the statistical significance of each rule by evaluating how well it separates high-yield and low-yield modifiers in the dataset. Rules that do not show a strong correlation should be revised or discarded. This evidence-based refinement enhances the reliability of the rules and their predictive power.

- **Advice 7**: **Include Negative Examples in Rule Formulation**  
  When formulating rules, explicitly consider modifiers that do not follow the pattern (negative examples). Understanding why certain modifiers lead to low yields despite fitting a positive rule can help refine the rule criteria and account for exceptions, improving the overall accuracy of the rule set.

- **Advice 8**: **Create Hierarchical Rules for Complex Interactions**  
  Develop a hierarchical (decision tree-like) structure for the rules to handle cases where multiple structural features interact to influence the yield. For example, an aliphatic carboxylic acid with a polar substituent might lead to low yield unless it also contains a coordinating heteroatom that compensates for the steric hindrance.

- **Advice 9**: **Standardize Nomenclature and Functional Group Definitions**  
  Ensure consistent use of chemical nomenclature and clearly define what constitutes a functional group within the rules. Ambiguities in terms like "long chain," "polar substituent," or "strong electron-withdrawing group" should be clarified with specific criteria (e.g., chain length >6 carbons, presence of hydroxyl groups, substituents with σ constants above a certain value).

- **Advice 10**: **Validate New Rules with Additional Data**  
  Before finalizing the new rules, test their predictive ability on an external dataset or through cross-validation within the existing dataset. This step verifies that the rules are generalizable and effective beyond the initial set of compounds.

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**, specifically those containing **additional carboxylic acid groups** adjacent to the amino group (e.g., **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)), result in a **high yield**. The extra carboxylate enhances coordination with the metal center through bidentate chelation, improving catalyst activity.

2. **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents** on the ring, such as **nitro**, **bromo**, or **carbonyl** groups (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**), result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

3. **Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents**, such as **methyl**, **hydroxyl**, or **methoxy** groups (e.g., **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**), result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease carboxyl acidity and hinder effective coordination with the metal center.

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms capable of chelation**, such as **pyridine** or **pyrazole** carboxylic acids (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**), result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, stabilizing the metal center and enhancing catalysis.

5. **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group on a short carbon chain**, specifically within three to five carbons (e.g., **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **4-aminobenzoic acid**), result in a **high yield**. The proximity of amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective bidentate coordination with the catalyst.

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains lacking polar substituents**, such as **octanoic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may promote favorable interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing reactivity.

7. **Rule 7**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents distant from the carboxyl group**, including **hydroxyl** or **amino** groups on chains longer than five carbons (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**), result in a **low yield**. The distant polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or disrupt optimal binding to the metal center.

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing aliphatic thiol groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The thiol group provides strong coordination with the metal due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur, enhancing catalyst performance.

9. **Rule 9**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) substituents on the ring**, like **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst efficiency.

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** or multiple **fluorine atoms** on the alkyl side chain (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**), result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorines decreases electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interaction with the metal center.

11. **Rule 11**: **Amino acids with non-coordinating, hydrophobic side chains lacking additional heteroatoms**, such as **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), result in a **low yield**. The absence of side-chain coordinating groups reduces ligand-metal interactions necessary for effective catalysis.

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing long polyether chains** or **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties**, such as **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether linkages and increased steric bulk hinder proper coordination with the metal catalyst.

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains**, like **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and offer additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.

14. **Rule 14**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding**, such as **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding may reduce the availability of coordinating sites, diminishing catalyst interaction.

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing aromatic thiol groups**, for example, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in a **low yield**. The aromatic system delocalizes the sulfur's lone pair electrons, decreasing its nucleophilicity and effectiveness in coordinating with the metal center.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward identification of modifiers fitting the criteria—amino acids with acidic side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups adjacent to the amino group. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, explaining how the extra carboxylate enhances metal coordination through bidentate chelation. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (amino acids with specific side chains) and is supported by at least two data points: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, both resulting in high yield. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly identifies aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents as leading to high yield. It provides sufficient physical-chemical insight by explaining that electron-withdrawing groups increase carboxyl acidity, enhancing metal coordination. The rule combines sub-structures and is supported by multiple data points—4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, and 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid—all showing high yield. The complexity and coverage are well-balanced.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents result in low yield. While the rule is clear and provides appropriate physical-chemical reasoning, there is an inconsistency in the data. Although 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid fit the rule and exhibit low yield, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid, which also contains electron-donating methoxy groups, results in a high yield. This contradiction suggests limited coverage and indicates that the rule may not fully account for all relevant factors.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear, focusing on modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms capable of chelation, leading to high yield. It offers adequate physical-chemical insight by highlighting the role of nitrogen atoms in stabilizing the metal center. However, there is a discrepancy: while pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid support the rule with high yields, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, which also fits the structural criteria, results in a low yield. This inconsistency suggests that additional factors may influence the outcome, indicating limited coverage of the rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly identifies aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group on a short carbon chain (three to five carbons) as resulting in high yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, explaining effective bidentate coordination due to the proximity of amino and carboxyl groups. The rule combines sub-structures and is supported by at least two data points—5-aminopentanoic acid and 4-aminobenzoic acid—both yielding high results. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains lacking polar substituents lead to high yield. While the rule is clear and provides some physical-chemical reasoning regarding hydrophobic interactions, it is supported by only one data point—octanoic acid. The limited coverage and simplicity of the rule may not adequately capture the complexity of the system, suggesting the need for additional supporting data.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and provides sufficient physical-chemical insight by explaining how distant polar substituents on long aliphatic chains may hinder metal coordination. It combines sub-structures and is supported by at least two data points—7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid—both resulting in low yield. The rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 focuses on modifiers containing aliphatic thiol groups adjacent to the carboxyl group, resulting in high yield. The rule is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight about sulfur's nucleophilicity enhancing metal coordination. However, it is supported by only one data point—3-sulfanylpropanoic acid. The limited coverage diminishes the robustness of the rule.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly identifies aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde substituents as resulting in low yield, providing appropriate physical-chemical reasoning about interference with metal coordination. The rule combines sub-structures and is supported by at least two data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—both showing low yield. The balance between complexity and coverage is satisfactory.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 specifies that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or multiple fluorine atoms result in low yield. While the rule is clear and offers physical-chemical insight, it may oversimplify the effects of fluorination. Supported by at least two data points—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid—both showing low yield, the rule has acceptable coverage but may benefit from refinement in physical-chemical explanation.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 identifies amino acids with non-coordinating, hydrophobic side chains lacking additional heteroatoms as resulting in low yield. While the rule is clear and provides physical-chemical reasoning, there is an inconsistency. (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine) results in low yield, supporting the rule, but (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan) results in high yield despite fitting the structural criteria. This inconsistency suggests limited coverage and indicates that additional factors may influence the outcome.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear, stating that modifiers containing long polyether chains or PEG moieties result in low yield due to steric hindrance and hindered coordination. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight and combines sub-structures. Supported by at least two data points—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid—both showing low yield, the rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 focuses on modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains resulting in high yield. While the rule is clear and offers physical-chemical reasoning about increased solubility and additional coordination sites, it is supported by only one data point—(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid). The limited coverage reduces the strength and general applicability of the rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding lead to low yield, providing appropriate physical-chemical insight. The rule is clear and combines sub-structures but is supported by only one data point—2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid. This limited coverage diminishes the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 identifies modifiers containing aromatic thiol groups as resulting in low yield, explaining that delocalization of sulfur's lone pair electrons decreases nucleophilicity. While the rule is clear and offers physical-chemical insight, it is supported by only one data point—4-sulfanylbenzoic acid. The limited coverage suggests that the rule may not be sufficiently generalizable.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 3 to account for additional functional groups influencing yield**. The current Rule 3 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents result in a low yield. However, compounds like **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** contain electron-donating methoxy groups but still result in a high yield. This suggests that other functional groups, such as the adjacent ketone, may enhance coordination with the metal center despite the presence of electron-donating groups. Modify Rule 3 to include exceptions where additional coordinating groups (e.g., ketones adjacent to aromatic rings) can override the effect of electron-donating substituents and lead to a high yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Modify Rule 4 to consider steric hindrance and substituent positioning**. While Rule 4 states that modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms capable of chelation result in a high yield, compounds like **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** show low yield despite fitting this criterion. Investigate the impact of substituent position and potential steric hindrance on coordination efficiency. Adjust Rule 4 to specify that the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring must be directly attached to the carboxylic acid group without bulky intervening groups that could hinder chelation.

- **Advice 3**: **Expand data coverage for Rule 6 or integrate it with related rules**. Rule 6, which states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains lacking polar substituents result in a high yield, is only supported by **octanoic acid**. To strengthen this rule, gather additional data on similar compounds to confirm its validity. Alternatively, consider integrating this rule with Rule 2 or Rule 5, focusing on hydrophobic interactions enhancing catalyst performance, to improve coverage and applicability.

- **Advice 4**: **Consolidate rules with limited support to enhance robustness**. Rules like **Rule 8**, **Rule 13**, **Rule 14**, and **Rule 15** are each supported by only one data point. To improve their reliability, consider merging these rules with others that have similar underlying principles. For example, combine **Rule 8** with **Rule 1** or **Rule 7** by emphasizing the role of specific functional groups (e.g., aliphatic thiols or hydroxyl groups) adjacent to the carboxylic acid in enhancing or hindering yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Differentiate between similar side chains in amino acids for Rule 11**. Rule 11 states that amino acids with non-coordinating, hydrophobic side chains lacking additional heteroatoms result in a low yield. However, **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) results in a high yield, suggesting that the presence of heteroatoms in the side chain (indole nitrogen) contributes to effective coordination. Clarify Rule 11 by emphasizing that amino acids with side chains lacking heteroatoms result in low yield, whereas those with heteroatoms, even within hydrophobic side chains, can result in high yield due to enhanced coordination.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate steric and electronic factors into existing rules**. Some inconsistencies may arise from steric hindrance or electronic effects not accounted for in the current rules. For example, bulky substituents or electron-rich environments might hinder coordination despite the presence of functional groups that typically enhance yield. Adjust rules to include considerations of steric bulk and electronic distribution, specifying when these factors may override expected outcomes based on functional groups alone.

- **Advice 7**: **Revise rules to consider synergistic effects of multiple functional groups**. Compounds with conflicting functional groups may not fit neatly into existing rules. For instance, electron-donating groups adjacent to coordinating groups may affect overall yield differently than when present alone. Update the rules to reflect the combined impact of multiple functional groups, possibly creating sub-rules or conditional statements that capture these nuances.

- **Advice 8**: **Introduce quantitative parameters to enhance predictive power of rules**. Where feasible, incorporate quantitative measures such as pKa values, electronic parameters (e.g., Hammett constants), or steric factors (e.g., Taft parameters) into the rules. This can help quantify the influence of substituents on coordination ability and yield, making the rules more precise and less reliant on individual data points.

- **Advice 9**: **Eliminate redundant rules by merging overlapping concepts**. Review the set of rules for redundancy or overlap, particularly where multiple rules address similar structural features or effects. For example, rules concerning electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents on aromatic rings may be combined into a single rule with subcategories. Streamlining the rules will enhance clarity and focus on the most impactful structural characteristics.

- **Advice 10**: **Conduct a comprehensive cross-validation of rules against the dataset**. Re-express and test each rule against all data points to identify any inconsistencies or exceptions. This iterative process will help refine the rules, ensuring they accurately reflect the observed relationships between modifier structures and yields. Adjust or discard rules that do not hold up under comprehensive validation, and strengthen those that consistently align with the data.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**, specifically those containing **additional carboxylic acid groups** adjacent to the amino group (e.g., **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)), result in a **high yield**. The extra carboxylate enhances coordination with the metal center through bidentate chelation, improving catalyst activity.

2. **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents** on the ring, such as **nitro**, **bromo**, or **carbonyl** groups (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**), result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

3. **Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents**, such as **methyl**, **hydroxyl**, or **methoxy** groups (e.g., **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**), result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease carboxyl acidity and hinder effective coordination with the metal center.

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms capable of chelation**, such as **pyridine** or **pyrazole** carboxylic acids (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**), result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, stabilizing the metal center and enhancing catalysis.

5. **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group on a short carbon chain**, specifically within three to five carbons (e.g., **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **4-aminobenzoic acid**), result in a **high yield**. The proximity of amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective bidentate coordination with the catalyst.

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains lacking polar substituents**, such as **octanoic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may promote favorable interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing reactivity.

7. **Rule 7**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents distant from the carboxyl group**, including **hydroxyl** or **amino** groups on chains longer than five carbons (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**), result in a **low yield**. The distant polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or disrupt optimal binding to the metal center.

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing aliphatic thiol groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The thiol group provides strong coordination with the metal due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur, enhancing catalyst performance.

9. **Rule 9**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) substituents on the ring**, like **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst efficiency.

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** or multiple **fluorine atoms** on the alkyl side chain (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**), result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorines decreases electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interaction with the metal center.

11. **Rule 11**: **Amino acids with non-coordinating, hydrophobic side chains lacking additional heteroatoms**, such as **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), result in a **low yield**. The absence of side-chain coordinating groups reduces ligand-metal interactions necessary for effective catalysis.

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing long polyether chains** or **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties**, such as **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether linkages and increased steric bulk hinder proper coordination with the metal catalyst.

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains**, like **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and offer additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.

14. **Rule 14**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding**, such as **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding may reduce the availability of coordinating sites, diminishing catalyst interaction.

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing aromatic thiol groups**, for example, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in a **low yield**. The aromatic system delocalizes the sulfur's lone pair electrons, decreasing its nucleophilicity and effectiveness in coordinating with the metal center.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Implement adjacency constraints in Rule 1.** Modify the SMARTS pattern to ensure that the additional carboxylic acid group is adjacent to the amino group. You can define a pattern where the amino group is connected to a carbon that is connected to a carboxylic acid, such as `[NX3;H2][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Implement chain length checks for Rules 5 and 7.** Currently, the `chain_length_range` is specified but not enforced in the code. You need to calculate the shortest path between the amino group and the carboxyl group and check if it falls within the specified range. Use methods like `Chem.GetShortestPath(mol, atom_idx1, atom_idx2)`.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Refine electron-withdrawing substituent patterns in Rule 2.** Ensure that nitro, bromo, or carbonyl groups are directly attached to the aromatic ring. Modify the SMARTS patterns to `[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]` for nitro groups and `[c][Br]` for bromo substituents on the ring.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Specify position of electron-donating groups in Rule 3.** Ensure that methyl, hydroxyl, or methoxy groups are directly attached to the aromatic ring. Use SMARTS patterns like `[c][CH3]`, `[c][OX2H]`, and `[c][OX2][CH3]` to match substituents on the ring.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Implement ortho-substitution checks in Rule 14.** Add code to determine if the hydroxyl group is in the ortho position relative to the carboxyl group. You can analyze the aromatic ring and identify substituents' positions using atom indices and bond connectivity.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Expand exclude patterns in Rule 6.** Besides the specified polar substituents, exclude other polar functional groups such as sulfonyl, phosphates, and amides. This ensures that only hydrocarbons without any polar groups are matched.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Correct application of exclude patterns.** Ensure that the code properly compiles and applies the exclude patterns. Verify that the logic correctly skips molecules when an exclude pattern is matched.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Synchronize pattern keys in `count_threshold`.** When compiling patterns, store the SMARTS strings alongside compiled patterns to ensure that the keys used in `count_threshold` match `pat.GetSmarts()` during pattern matching.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Handle additional constraints specified in the rules.** Implement the handling of `ortho_substituent` in Rule 14 and any other constraints like `count_threshold` or `chain_length_range` by adding the necessary logic in your code to interpret and apply these constraints.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Test SMARTS patterns individually.** Before running the full code, test each SMARTS pattern against known SMILES examples to ensure they match the intended structures. Use RDKit's `mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat)` to verify.

   - **Analysis**: An increase in confidence by approximately **13.64 percentage points** signifies that when the rules are applied, they are more likely to make correct predictions. This is a positive development indicating improved reliability of the rules.

3. **Train Lift**:
   - **Reference Metrics**: The average train lift was approximately **1.1304**.
   - **Current Metrics**: The current train lift has increased to **1.4661**.
   - **Analysis**: The lift has improved significantly, indicating that the rules are more effective at predicting outcomes than random chance. A lift greater than 1 suggests strong association, and the increase implies enhanced rule significance.

4. **Train Leverage**:
   - **Reference Metrics**: The average train leverage was approximately **0.0124**.
   - **Current Metrics**: The current train leverage is **0.0128**.
   - **Analysis**: Leverage remains relatively stable, suggesting that the proportion of additional support the rules receive over what would be expected by chance has not changed markedly. The positive value continues to indicate a stronger association than expected by chance.

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

Based on the current metrics:

- The **increase in confidence and lift** indicates that the rules have become more precise and are better at identifying the correct outcomes when they apply.
- However, the **decrease in support** suggests that the rules now cover fewer instances in the dataset. This trade-off between confidence (precision) and support (coverage) is a common phenomenon in rule optimization.
  
Considering these factors, it appears that the current set of rules has achieved higher precision at the expense of coverage. Whether a local minimum has been reached depends on the acceptable balance between confidence and support for the specific application.

- **Local Minimum Determination**: If the primary goal is to maximize confidence and lift—even if support decreases—then the current metrics might represent a local optimum.
- **Iterations**: Given that previous iterations showed lower confidence and lift but higher support, it suggests that the rules are converging towards higher precision. If further iterations continue to reduce support significantly without substantial gains in confidence and lift, it might indicate diminishing returns.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the current rules, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Balance Between Support and Confidence**:
   - **Objective**: Increase support while maintaining high confidence and lift.
   - **Approach**: Review rules that contribute to high confidence but low support. Consider generalizing some conditions slightly to cover more instances without significantly compromising confidence.
   - **Action**: Identify commonalities among excluded instances that could be incorporated into existing rules or used to formulate new rules.

2. **Rule Refinement**:
   - **Objective**: Optimize individual rules to improve overall metrics.
   - **Approach**:
     - **Analyze Underperforming Rules**: Rules with low support and confidence (e.g., Rules 7, 9, 12, 14, 15) should be examined to determine if they can be modified or pruned.
     - **Consolidate Similar Rules**: Combine rules with overlapping conditions to simplify the rule set and improve support.
     - **Adjust Conditions**: For rules with very specific conditions that limit support, consider relaxing certain constraints while monitoring the impact on confidence.

3. **Incorporate Additional Data**:
   - **Objective**: Enhance the rules with more comprehensive data.
   - **Approach**: Integrate more descriptors or features that might capture relevant patterns not currently accounted for.
   - **Action**: Expand the dataset with additional properties of the modifiers, such as steric factors, electronic properties, or solubility parameters.

4. **Utilize Advanced Modeling Techniques**:
   - **Objective**: Improve predictive performance using more sophisticated models.
   - **Approach**: Employ machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to identify complex nonlinear interactions that simple rules may miss.
   - **Action**: Use these models to generate insights that can inform the development of new rules or the adjustment of existing ones.

5. **Cross-Validation and Testing**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data.
   - **Approach**: Implement k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the rules more robustly.
   - **Action**: Analyze the consistency of confidence and lift across different folds. Significant variance may indicate overfitting, necessitating rule simplification.

6. **Domain Expertise Integration**:
   - **Objective**: Leverage chemical knowledge to inform rule adjustments.
   - **Approach**: Collaborate with chemists to understand the underlying mechanisms and possibly identify overlooked factors influencing catalyst performance.
   - **Action**: Use this expertise to modify rules in a way that aligns with known chemical behavior, potentially improving both support and confidence.

**Conclusion**

The current rules exhibit improved confidence and lift compared to previous iterations, indicating better predictive accuracy when the rules apply. However, the decrease in support suggests a narrower applicability. To enhance the overall performance, it's crucial to find a balance between precision and coverage.

By refining the existing rules, exploring potential generalizations, and possibly integrating additional data and modeling techniques, it's possible to improve support without significantly sacrificing confidence and lift. Continuous iteration with careful monitoring of the metrics will help determine if a more optimal set of rules can be achieved or if the current rules represent the practical limit given the available data.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation Set and Train Set:**

The current 5-fold validation accuracy achieved by the classification model is **68.57%**, which is lower than the previous reference accuracies that consistently hovered around **76%** with test accuracies of **75%** or **62.5%**. This decline in validation accuracy suggests that the recent modifications to the feature matrix, guided by the current set of 15 rules, may not have effectively captured the underlying patterns in the data as well as previous iterations did.

**Analysis Based on the SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides valuable insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions for individual molecules. By examining the SHAP values, we can identify which rules are positively or negatively influencing the prediction of high or low catalytic loading.

**Discrepancies Identified:**

1. **Underestimation Cases (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - **Molecule:** *C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*

     - **Rules with Most Negative SHAP Values:**
       - **Rule 5:** SHAP value of **-0.1634**
       - **Rule 2:** SHAP value of **-0.0264**
       - **Rule 4:** SHAP value of **-0.0977**
       - **Rule 9:** SHAP value of **0.0249**
     - **Analysis:** The negative SHAP values from **Rule 5** (Aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group on a short carbon chain result in high yield) and **Rule 4** are contributing to underestimating the loading. This suggests that **Rule 5** may not be accurately capturing the behavior of this molecule.

   - **Molecule:** *C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O*

     - **Rules with Most Negative SHAP Values:**
       - **Rule 5:** SHAP value of **-0.1818**
       - **Rule 2:** SHAP value of **-0.0919**
       - **Rule 4:** SHAP value of **-0.0315**
     - **Analysis:** Again, **Rule 5** is significantly contributing to the underestimation. The negative SHAP value indicates that the rule is pushing the prediction towards low loading, whereas experimentally it is high.

2. **Overestimation Cases (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecule:** *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O*

     - **Rules with Most Positive SHAP Values:**
       - **Rule 5:** SHAP value of **0.0999**
       - **Rule 9:** SHAP value of **0.0373**
       - **Rule 10:** SHAP value of **0.0622**
     - **Analysis:** **Rule 5** is contributing to the overestimation of loading in this case. The molecule does not conform well to the criteria of **Rule 5**, suggesting the rule may be overly broad or misapplied.

   - **Molecule:** *CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O*

     - **Rules with Most Positive SHAP Values:**
       - **Rule 2:** SHAP value of **0.2375**
       - **Rule 9:** SHAP value of **0.0651**
       - **Rule 10:** SHAP value of **0.0434**
     - **Analysis:** **Rule 2** (Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents result in a high yield) has a high positive SHAP value, indicating it heavily influences the prediction towards high loading, despite the experimental result being low.

**Evaluation of Current Rules and Model Performance:**

- **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
  The decrease in validation accuracy from previous iterations (76% to current 68.57%) indicates that the current set of rules may not be as effective in modeling the data. The strong influence of certain rules leading to incorrect predictions suggests that some rules may not generalize well across different molecules.

- **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
  The drop in accuracy and inconsistency in predictions suggest potential **underfitting**. The model may be too simplistic or the rules too rigid, failing to capture complex relationships in the data.

- **Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**
  The lack of improvement in accuracy metrics suggests that the current rule set may have reached a local minimum in terms of performance. The model's predictive capability has not enhanced with the recent adjustments, indicating a need for refinement of the rules.

- **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
  The SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that contribute significantly to incorrect predictions. Notably, **Rules 2, 4, 5, and 9** frequently appear with high SHAP values (either positive or negative) in cases of misclassification.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Rule 5:**

   - **Issue Identified:** **Rule 5** is contributing to both overestimations and underestimations, indicating it may be too broad or not accurately defined.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Re-express **Rule 5** to include more specific structural criteria that differentiate between molecules that truly result in high yield and those that do not. Consider incorporating additional functional groups or chain lengths in the rule definition to improve specificity.

2. **Adjust Rule 2:**

   - **Issue Identified:** High positive SHAP values from **Rule 2** contribute to overestimations where the experimental loading is low.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Modify **Rule 2** to refine the definition of "strong electron-withdrawing substituents." Perhaps exclude certain substituents that do not consistently enhance yield or define the positions on the aromatic ring that are most influential.

3. **Review Rule 4 and Rule 9:**

   - **Issue Identified:** Both **Rule 4** and **Rule 9** have high SHAP values influencing predictions incorrectly in certain cases.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Reevaluate these rules to ensure they accurately represent the chemistry of the modifiers. Adjust the rules to account for exceptions or limitations observed in the data.

4. **Improve Generalization:**

   - Incorporate more nuanced features that capture the electronic and steric effects influencing catalyst performance.
   - Consider adding modifiers to the rules that account for intramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, which may affect coordination with the catalyst.

5. **Address Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   - **Underfitting Resolution:** Introduce additional rules or modify existing ones to capture more complex relationships in the data. Ensure that the rules cover the diversity of molecular structures present in the dataset.
   - Implement cross-validation techniques to test the robustness of the rules and prevent overfitting to specific subsets of data.

6. **Leverage SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement:**

   - Use the SHAP values to identify which rules consistently contribute to incorrect predictions and prioritize them for refinement.
   - Analyze molecules where predictions are incorrect despite high confidence (high absolute SHAP values) to understand underlying patterns not captured by current rules.

7. **Incorporate Additional Data and Features:**

   - If available, include more experimental data to enrich the training set, improving the model's ability to generalize.
   - Consider features that quantify molecular properties such as pKa, hydrophobicity (logP), or molecular size, which may impact catalytic activity.

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules shows limitations in accurately predicting the catalytic loading of modifiers across different molecules. By refining specific rules—particularly Rules 2, 4, 5, and 9—and enhancing the feature matrix with more detailed molecular descriptors, we can improve the model's performance. Continuous iterative refinement, guided by insights from SHAP analysis and validation metrics, will be essential in developing a robust predictive model for catalytic activity.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing the Current Rules**

The analysis of the current rules and their performance has highlighted several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the predictive accuracy of the model in describing the catalytic action of modified catalysts using SMILES representations. Below is a summary of the key points from the discussions, along with suggestions for optimizing the current rules:

1. **Current Rule Performance Metrics**:
   - **Confidence and Lift**: There is an increase in train confidence (from ~58.74% to 72.38%) and lift (from ~1.13 to 1.47) compared to previous metrics, indicating improved precision when the rules apply.
   - **Support**: The train support has decreased by approximately 53%, suggesting that the rules now cover fewer instances in the dataset.

2. **Validation Accuracy and SHAP Analysis**:
   - The 5-fold validation accuracy has decreased from previous iterations (from ~76% to 68.57%), indicating that the model's ability to generalize has diminished.
   - SHAP analysis has revealed that certain rules (notably **Rules 2, 4, 5, and 9**) are contributing significantly to incorrect predictions, either underestimations or overestimations.

3. **Issues Identified with Specific Rules**:
   - **Rule 5**: Contributing to both underestimations and overestimations, suggesting it may be too broad or not accurately capturing the intended chemical behavior.
   - **Rule 2**: High positive SHAP values in some cases lead to overestimations, indicating a need for refinement in defining electron-withdrawing substituents.
   - **Rule 4 and Rule 9**: Inconsistencies in predictions point to possible inaccuracies in the current formulations of these rules.

4. **Trade-off Between Confidence and Support**:
   - The increase in confidence and lift has come at the expense of decreased support, meaning that while predictions are more accurate when the rules apply, they apply less frequently.

**Suggestions to Improve the Current Rules**

1. **Implement Adjacency Constraints and Structural Specificity**:
   - **Rule 1**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to ensure that additional carboxylic acid groups are adjacent to the amino group, improving the specificity of the rule.
   - **Rule 5**: Enforce chain length checks by calculating the shortest path between the amino group and the carboxyl group to ensure proper proximity.

2. **Refine Electron-Withdrawing and Donating Substituent Patterns**:
   - **Rule 2**: Ensure that electron-withdrawing groups are directly attached to the aromatic ring and refine the SMARTS patterns to match specific substituents accurately.
   - **Rule 3**: Specify the positions of electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring to avoid misclassification.

3. **Adjust Rules with High SHAP Contributions to Misclassifications**:
   - **Rule 5**: Re-express the rule to include more precise structural criteria, possibly by incorporating additional functional groups or specifying exact chain lengths.
   - **Rule 2**: Refine the definition of "strong electron-withdrawing substituents" and consider positional effects on the aromatic ring.

4. **Incorporate Additional Constraints and Exclusions**:
   - **Rule 6**: Expand the exclude patterns to cover other polar functional groups, ensuring only nonpolar hydrocarbons are matched.
   - **Rule 14**: Implement ortho-substitution checks to account for intramolecular hydrogen bonding that may affect coordination with the metal center.

5. **Improve Rule Application Logic**:
   - Ensure that exclude patterns are correctly applied in the code, and that the logic for skipping molecules that match exclude patterns functions as intended.
   - Synchronize the keys used in `count_threshold` with the compiled patterns to avoid mismatches during pattern matching.

6. **Test and Validate SMARTS Patterns Individually**:
   - Before integrating the patterns into the full model, test each SMARTS pattern against known SMILES examples to verify that they match the intended structures accurately.

7. **Enhance Generalization and Reduce Overfitting**:
   - **Balance Support and Confidence**: Adjust the rules to cover more instances without significantly compromising confidence by generalizing conditions where appropriate.
   - **Consolidate Similar Rules**: Combine overlapping rules to simplify the rule set and improve support.
   - **Prune or Modify Underperforming Rules**: Reevaluate rules with low support and confidence for potential elimination or adjustment.

8. **Leverage Chemical Domain Expertise**:
   - Collaborate with chemists to gain insights into the underlying chemical mechanisms, which can inform more accurate rule definitions and adjustments.

9. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors**:
   - Consider integrating features such as pKa, hydrophobicity, steric factors, and electronic properties to capture relevant patterns not currently accounted for in the rules.

10. **Utilize Advanced Modeling Techniques**:
    - Employ machine learning algorithms to identify complex nonlinear interactions and generate insights that can inform rule development and refinement.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is potential for further optimizing the current rules without overfitting. The following points support this conclusion:

- **Underfitting Indications**: The decrease in validation accuracy and inconsistencies highlighted by the SHAP analysis suggest that the model may be underfitting the data, and more nuanced rules could improve performance.

- **Specific Rules Causing Misclassifications**: By refining or adjusting specific rules that contribute to incorrect predictions, it is possible to enhance the model's accuracy while maintaining generalization.

- **Balancing Precision and Coverage**: Adjusting the rules to achieve a better balance between confidence and support can increase the applicability of the model without overcomplicating it.

- **Incorporating Additional Features**: Including more molecular descriptors and leveraging domain expertise can provide a deeper understanding of the factors influencing catalytic activity, leading to more accurate and robust rules.

**Conclusion**

By implementing the suggested improvements and refining the current rules, it is possible to enhance the predictive performance of the model. The key is to make targeted adjustments that address the identified issues without unnecessarily increasing the complexity of the rule set.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains**, specifically those containing **additional carboxylic acid groups** adjacent to the amino group (e.g., **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)), result in a **high yield**. The extra carboxylate enhances coordination with the metal center through bidentate chelation, improving catalyst activity.

2. **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents** on the ring, such as **nitro**, **bromo**, or **carbonyl** groups (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**), result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

3. **Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents**, such as **methyl**, **hydroxyl**, or **methoxy** groups (e.g., **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**), result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease carboxyl acidity and hinder effective coordination with the metal center.

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms capable of chelation**, such as **pyridine** or **pyrazole** carboxylic acids (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**), result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, stabilizing the metal center and enhancing catalysis.

5. **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group on a short carbon chain**, specifically within three to five carbons (e.g., **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **4-aminobenzoic acid**), result in a **high yield**. The proximity of amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective bidentate coordination with the catalyst.

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains lacking polar substituents**, such as **octanoic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may promote favorable interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing reactivity.

7. **Rule 7**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents distant from the carboxyl group**, including **hydroxyl** or **amino** groups on chains longer than five carbons (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**), result in a **low yield**. The distant polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or disrupt optimal binding to the metal center.

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing aliphatic thiol groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The thiol group provides strong coordination with the metal due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur, enhancing catalyst performance.

9. **Rule 9**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) substituents on the ring**, like **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst efficiency.

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** or multiple **fluorine atoms** on the alkyl side chain (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**), result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorines decreases electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interaction with the metal center.

11. **Rule 11**: **Amino acids with non-coordinating, hydrophobic side chains lacking additional heteroatoms**, such as **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), result in a **low yield**. The absence of side-chain coordinating groups reduces ligand-metal interactions necessary for effective catalysis.

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing long polyether chains** or **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties**, such as **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether linkages and increased steric bulk hinder proper coordination with the metal catalyst.

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains**, like **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and offer additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.

14. **Rule 14**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding**, such as **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding may reduce the availability of coordinating sites, diminishing catalyst interaction.

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing aromatic thiol groups**, for example, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in a **low yield**. The aromatic system delocalizes the sulfur's lone pair electrons, decreasing its nucleophilicity and effectiveness in coordinating with the metal center.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- ** Advice 1 **: **For Rule 1**, modify the SMARTS pattern to ensure that the additional carboxylic acid groups are adjacent to the amino group. Update the pattern to specify that the amino group (-NH₂) is connected to a carbon atom that is directly bonded to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and that there is an additional carboxyl group adjacent to it. This increases specificity by targeting amino acids like aspartic acid and glutamic acid where the extra carboxylate enhances coordination.

- ** Advice 2 **: **For Rule 5**, enforce chain length checks by explicitly defining the number of carbon atoms between the amino group and the carboxyl group in the SMARTS pattern. Adjust the pattern to match aliphatic amino acids where the amino and carboxyl groups are separated by a chain of three to five carbons. This ensures accurate identification of modifiers that allow effective bidentate coordination due to appropriate proximity.

- ** Advice 3 **: **For Rule 2**, refine the SMARTS patterns to ensure that electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromo, carbonyl) are directly attached to the aromatic ring and at positions that significantly increase the acidity of the carboxyl group. Specify ortho and para positions in the pattern to capture substituents that enhance coordination ability. Exclude molecules where substituents are meta or disconnected from influencing the carboxyl group's acidity.

- ** Advice 4 **: **For Rule 3**, specify the positions of electron-donating substituents on the aromatic ring in the SMARTS pattern. Focus on capturing molecules where these groups are in positions that decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group (e.g., ortho and para to the carboxyl group). This refinement reduces misclassification by accounting for positional effects on electron donation.

- ** Advice 5 **: **For Rule 6**, expand the exclude patterns to cover other polar functional groups by adding additional SMARTS patterns that represent hydroxyl, amino, and other polar substituents. Ensure that the rule only matches aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains lacking any polar groups. This prevents polar-modified long-chain acids from being incorrectly included as high-yield modifiers.

- ** Advice 6 **: **For Rule 14**, implement ortho-substitution checks in the SMARTS pattern to account for intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Modify the pattern to match aromatic carboxylic acids where the hydroxyl group is ortho to the carboxyl group, which can reduce the availability of coordination sites due to hydrogen bonding, leading to low yield.

- ** Advice 7 **: **Ensure correct application of exclude patterns** in the code by reviewing the logic that handles pattern matching. Verify that molecules matching exclude patterns are properly skipped before applying the include patterns. This avoids false positives and ensures that the rules are correctly identifying target molecules.

- ** Advice 8 **: **Synchronize the keys in `count_threshold` with the compiled SMARTS patterns** to prevent mismatches during pattern matching. Confirm that each pattern's key corresponds accurately between the `count_threshold` dictionary and the compiled patterns used for matching.

- ** Advice 9 **: **Test and validate each SMARTS pattern individually** against a set of known SMILES examples. Create a testing suite where each rule is applied to examples it should match and examples it should not match. This step verifies the accuracy and specificity of each rule before it is used in the model.

- ** Advice 10 **: **Reevaluate Rule 5** by adding more precise structural criteria. Consider incorporating additional functional groups that may be present or specifying exact chain lengths and branching patterns. This refinement addresses the SHAP analysis findings where Rule 5 contributes to misclassifications, thereby improving its predictive reliability.

- ** Advice 11 **: **Refine Rule 2** by clarifying the definition of "strong electron-withdrawing substituents" and considering their specific effects based on position on the aromatic ring. Exclude substituents that are not sufficiently electron-withdrawing or are in positions that do not enhance carboxyl acidity to reduce overestimations in predictions.

- ** Advice 12 **: **Consolidate similar rules** to simplify the rule set and increase support. For instance, combine Rules 2 and 4 into a broader rule that covers aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents that enhance metal coordination, specifying criteria for both electron-withdrawing groups and heteroatoms capable of chelation.

- ** Advice 13 **: **Prune or modify underperforming rules** identified by low support or confidence, or significant contributions to misclassifications (e.g., Rules with low train support or negative SHAP values). Adjust these rules to improve their effectiveness or remove them if they do not contribute positively to the model's predictive power.

- ** Advice 14 **: **Adjust rules to balance support and confidence** by generalizing conditions where appropriate to cover more instances without significantly compromising confidence. Ensure that each rule is both chemically meaningful and statistically robust to enhance the model's applicability and accuracy.

- ** Advice 15 **: **Seek input from chemical domain experts** to gain deeper insights into the factors affecting yield. Use this expertise to inform more accurate and nuanced rule definitions, especially for complex cases where structural features have subtle effects on catalytic performance.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups**, such as **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid), result in a **high yield**. The extra carboxylate groups enhance chelation with the metal catalyst, improving coordination and activity.

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating functional groups**, such as **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine) and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, result in a **low yield**. The absence of side-chain coordinating sites reduces interaction with the catalyst, diminishing effectiveness.

3. **Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents** like **nitro** or **bromo** groups (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**), result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance coordination with the metal catalyst.

4. **Rule 4**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating para-substituents lacking additional coordinating groups**, such as **4-methylbenzoic acid**, result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

5. **Rule 5**: **Heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the heteroatom is adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The heteroatom (nitrogen) enhances binding to the metal center through additional coordination.

6. **Rule 6**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) substituents on the ring**, like **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination or undergo side reactions, reducing catalyst efficiency.

7. **Rule 7**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains lacking polar substituents**, such as **octanoic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may promote favorable interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing reactivity.

8. **Rule 8**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups distant from the carboxyl group** (more than five carbons away), such as **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, result in a **low yield**. Distant polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or disrupt optimal binding to the metal center.

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The thiol group provides strong coordination with the metal due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur. Conversely, **thiol groups on aromatic rings**, like in **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in a **low yield** because aromatic delocalization reduces sulfur's nucleophilicity.

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** or multiple **fluorine atoms** on the alkyl side chain (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**), result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorines decreases electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interaction with the metal center.

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing long polyether chains** or **polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties**, such as **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, result in a **low yield**. The flexible ether linkages and increased steric bulk hinder proper coordination with the metal catalyst.

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains**, like **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and offer additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with bulky or complex structures**, such as **peptides** or **peptide-like compounds** (e.g., **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**), result in a **low yield**. Increased steric hindrance and complexity interfere with catalyst interaction, reducing effectiveness.

14. **Rule 14**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding**, such as **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of coordinating sites, diminishing catalyst interaction.

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with additional ketone groups on aliphatic side chains attached to aromatic rings**, like **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** and **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The ketone groups provide extra coordination sites via carbonyl oxygens, enhancing binding to the metal center.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Rule Coverage by Expanding Data Sets**  
  Several rules, such as **Rule 7**, **Rule 8**, **Rule 9**, **Rule 14**, and **Rule 15**, are supported by only one or two data points. To improve the robustness and reliability of these rules, consider gathering additional data or experimental results for modifiers that fit these categories. This will strengthen the rules' validity and applicability.

- **Advice 2**: **Address Inconsistencies and Exceptions in Existing Rules**  
  Some rules exhibit inconsistencies with the provided data. For instance, **Rule 3** states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents result in a low yield, yet **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (which contains electron-donating methoxy groups) results in a high yield. Refine the rules to account for such exceptions, possibly by considering additional functional groups that might influence the outcome, such as ketones enhancing coordination despite the presence of electron-donating groups.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rules Involving Heteroaromatic Compounds**  
  **Rule 5** suggests that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a high yield. However, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** yields a low result despite fitting this description. Modify the rule to include positional effects of the heteroatom relative to the carboxyl group and consider steric factors or electronic delocalization that may impact metal coordination.

- **Advice 4**: **Combine Similar Rules for Clarity and Efficiency**  
  Some rules overlap or address similar concepts. For example, **Rule 2** and **Rule 7** both deal with hydrophobic modifiers lacking polar substituents. Consider merging these rules to simplify the rule set and improve clarity. A combined rule could state that modifiers with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups generally result in low yield, emphasizing the importance of coordinating functional groups.

- **Advice 5**: **Explicitly State Exceptions and Conditional Factors**  
  Incorporate known exceptions into the rules to enhance their accuracy. For instance, adjust **Rule 3** to acknowledge that additional coordinating groups like ketones can override the effects of electron-donating substituents, leading to high yields. This will make the rules more nuanced and applicable to a broader range of modifiers.

- **Advice 6**: **Improve Physical-Chemical Explanations in Rules**  
  Enhance the scientific rationale within each rule to better explain why specific structural features influence the yield. For example, elaborate on how electron-withdrawing groups increase carboxyl acidity or how intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces available coordination sites. This deeper insight will aid in the understanding and application of the rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Quantitative Parameters Where Applicable**  
  Where possible, include quantitative descriptors such as pKa values, steric hindrance metrics, or Hammett sigma constants to provide a more precise understanding of how modifiers influence the reaction yield. This can help predict outcomes more accurately for modifiers not yet tested.

- **Advice 8**: **Consider Steric and Electronic Effects Together**  
  Modify the rules to account for both steric hindrance and electronic factors simultaneously. For instance, large substituents may not only introduce steric hindrance but also impact electronic properties. Rules should reflect the combined effects to improve predictability.

- **Advice 9**: **Reassess the Impact of Functional Group Positioning**  
  Investigate how the position of functional groups relative to the carboxyl group affects yield. In some cases, moving a functional group even by one position can change its impact on metal coordination. Adjust the rules to include positional specificity where relevant.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate Rules with Computational Modeling and Further Experiments**  
  Utilize computational chemistry methods to model metal-ligand interactions for proposed modifiers. This can help predict their effectiveness and refine the rules accordingly. Additionally, design and perform new experiments to test modifiers that challenge or expand current rules.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify Rules Using Specific Functional Groups**  
  Redefine the rules to focus on identifiable functional groups or substructures that can be directly parsed from SMILES strings. For example, instead of "electron-withdrawing substituents," specify "presence of nitro groups (`-NO2`), halogens (`-F`, `-Cl`, `-Br`, `-I`)," etc. This allows for straightforward identification and counting of these groups, facilitating numerical feature extraction.

- **Advice 2**: **Translate Electronic Effects into Numerical Values**  
  Assign quantitative values to substituents based on known electronic parameters like Hammett sigma constants. Create a numerical scale for electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects of functional groups present in the modifiers. This approach quantifies the influence of substituents on acidity and coordination ability.

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify Steric Hindrance Numerically**  
  Incorporate steric parameters such as the Taft steric parameter (`Es`) or use molecular descriptors like molar refractivity and Van der Waals volume. These values can be calculated from the molecular structure and help quantify the impact of steric bulk on modifier effectiveness.

- **Advice 4**: **Use Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints**  
  Utilize cheminformatics tools to compute molecular descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, topological polar surface area, number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, logP values) and generate molecular fingerprints from SMILES strings. These numerical features can be used directly in statistical models to predict yield outcomes.

- **Advice 5**: **Reframe Rules Based on Quantitative Structure–Property Relationships (QSPR)**  
  Develop QSPR models that correlate specific molecular descriptors with reaction yield. By focusing on quantitative relationships, you can create more generalizable rules that are directly tied to measurable properties, enhancing predictive power.

- **Advice 6**: **Define Specific Distance-Based Features**  
  Create numerical descriptors that capture the distance between functional groups, such as the number of atoms between a carboxyl group and a coordinating group (amino, hydroxyl, thiol). This quantifies the proximity of functional groups that may influence coordination efficiency.

- **Advice 7**: **Standardize Functional Group Categories**  
  Establish a standardized list of functional groups relevant to the reaction (e.g., carboxylic acids, amines, hydroxyls, thiols, aldehydes, ketones, halogens, aromatic rings). Categorize modifiers based on these groups to simplify rule application and feature extraction.

- **Advice 8**: **Count Atom Types and Bond Types**  
  Include numerical counts of specific atom types (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, halogens) and bond types (e.g., single, double, aromatic bonds). This provides a straightforward way to represent structural information numerically.

- **Advice 9**: **Automate Feature Generation with Cheminformatics Tools**  
  Leverage software like RDKit or Open Babel to parse SMILES strings and automatically calculate molecular descriptors and fingerprints. Automation ensures consistency and efficiency in feature generation, enabling scalable analysis.

- **Advice 10**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules for Clarity**  
  Review and merge rules that cover similar chemical phenomena to reduce redundancy. For example, combine Rules 1 and 10 into a single rule focusing on modifiers with multiple coordinating groups near the carboxyl group, and quantify this feature for numerical analysis.

- **Advice 11**: **Include Solubility and Lipophilicity Parameters**  
  Incorporate descriptors like the partition coefficient (`logP`) and aqueous solubility, which can affect reaction outcomes. These parameters are calculable from molecular structures and add valuable information regarding the modifiers' behavior in the reaction medium.

- **Advice 12**: **Calculate Partial Charges for Electronic Insight**  
  Use computational chemistry methods to calculate partial atomic charges, particularly on coordinating atoms like oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Numerical charge values can quantify the propensity of functional groups to coordinate with metal centers.

- **Advice 13**: **Assess Molecular Flexibility**  
  Include descriptors that quantify molecular flexibility, such as the number of rotatable bonds or the flexibility index. Flexibility can influence how well a modifier coordinates with the catalyst, affecting reaction yield.

- **Advice 14**: **Update Rules Based on Data-Driven Analysis**  
  Perform statistical analyses (e.g., regression, classification) using the newly generated numerical features to identify which features most significantly correlate with high or low yields. Use these insights to refine the rules, ensuring they are supported by empirical data.

** Start of Advice **
- **Advice 1**: Rephrase the rules using specific structural features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. Define these features using standardized cheminformatics terms or SMARTS patterns to enable automated parsing and feature generation.

- **Advice 2**: Develop a clear, standardized list of functional groups and molecular fragments relevant to the reaction yield. Assign binary or numerical variables to their presence, facilitating the creation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: Simplify and consolidate overlapping or similar rules to reduce complexity. For example, merge rules related to electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups by quantifying their electronic effects using established parameters like Hammett sigma constants.

- **Advice 4**: Specify exact definitions for ambiguous terms in the rules. Instead of terms like "short-chain" or "long-chain" aliphatic acids, define them by exact carbon counts (e.g., "aliphatic carboxylic acids with 1-5 carbons").

- **Advice 5**: Replace qualitative descriptors with quantifiable molecular properties. Incorporate physicochemical properties such as LogP (hydrophobicity), pKa (acidity), molecular weight, and topological polar surface area, which can be computed from SMILES.

- **Advice 6**: Utilize computational tools and cheminformatics libraries (e.g., RDKit) to automatically extract molecular descriptors from SMILES strings. This ensures consistency and efficiency in feature generation for the dataset.

- **Advice 7**: Convert rules into mathematical expressions or decision tree formats that can be directly applied to calculate features. For instance, create rules like "If the molecule contains an amino group alpha to the carboxylic acid (SMARTS pattern: '[NX3][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'), assign a value of 1; else, assign 0."

- **Advice 8**: Focus on the position and type of functional groups relative to the carboxyl group in a manner that can be encoded numerically. For example, define variables for "para-position substituents" on aromatic rings and categorize them based on electronic effects.

- **Advice 9**: Eliminate or modify rules based on features that are difficult to detect or quantify from SMILES strings alone, such as steric hindrance from "long hydrophobic chains." Instead, use computationally accessible proxies like molecular volume or branching indices.

- **Advice 10**: Validate the refined rules by applying them to the dataset and checking for consistency between predicted and observed yields. Adjust the rules iteratively to improve their predictive accuracy and computational feasibility.

**Start of Advice**
- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Descriptors**  
  Reformulate each rule to be based on quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. This includes properties such as:
  - **Functional Group Counts**: Number of specific functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amino groups, hydroxyl groups).
  - **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**: Counts of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.
  - **Molecular Weight (MW)**: Total molecular weight of the modifier.
  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**: Measures the polarity of the molecule.
  - **LogP**: Represents the hydrophobicity of the molecule.
  - **Steric Parameters**: Such as molecular volume or specific steric hindrance around the coordinating groups.

- **Advice 2**: **Define Specific Substructures Using SMARTS Patterns**  
  For each rule, identify and define specific substructures or functional groups using SMARTS notation. This allows for the detection of structural motifs directly from SMILES:
  - **Coordinate Patterns**: Presence of coordinating heteroatoms (N, O, S) adjacent to the carboxyl group.
  - **Distance Metrics**: Number of bonds between functional groups (e.g., amino group within three carbons of a carboxyl group).
  - **Ring Systems**: Identification of aromatic or heteroaromatic rings.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing/Deselecting Groups**: Presence of nitro, halogens, or perfluorinated chains.

- **Advice 3**: **Consolidate and Simplify Overlapping Rules**  
  Merge similar rules to reduce complexity and redundancy:
  - Combine rules that involve **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups**.
  - Group together **aliphatic acids with nearby coordinating groups** regardless of the specific functional group type.
  - Create broader categories that can be adjusted with specific descriptors.

- **Advice 4**: **Use Existing Chemoinformatics Descriptors and Fingerprints**  
  Utilize standardized molecular descriptors and fingerprints:
  - **RDKit Descriptors**: Such as `NumRotatableBonds`, `RingCount`, `FractionCSP3`.
  - **Molecular Fingerprints**: Like **Morgan fingerprints** for substructure similarity.
  - **Custom Descriptors**: Tailor-made descriptors relevant to coordination chemistry (e.g., coordination number).

- **Advice 5**: **Implement a Data-Driven Feature Selection Approach**  
  Analyze the dataset to identify which descriptors correlate most with yield:
  - Perform **statistical analysis** to find significant predictors.
  - Use **machine learning models** (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to evaluate feature importance.
  - Update rules based on features with high predictive power.

- **Advice 6**: **Provide Numerical Thresholds and Clear Criteria**  
  Define exact numerical values or ranges for descriptors within the rules:
  - Specify thresholds (e.g., TPSA > 80 Å² indicates high coordination potential).
  - Quantify steric hindrance (e.g., molecules with molecular weight > 200 g/mol may introduce steric effects).
  - Use counts (e.g., Hydrogen bond donors ≥ 2 contribute to high yield).

- **Advice 7**: **Automate Feature Extraction from SMILES**  
  Incorporate scripts or tools that can directly compute the desired descriptors from SMILES:
  - Use platforms like **RDKit** or **Open Babel** for automation.
  - Ensure reproducibility and consistency in feature calculation.
  - Create a pipeline that links SMILES input to descriptor output seamlessly.

- **Advice 8**: **Include Examples for Each Rule with Calculated Descriptors**  
  Provide illustrative examples showing how the descriptors are calculated and applied:
  - For each rule, list modifiers with their calculated descriptor values.
  - Show the correlation between descriptor values and the observed yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Develop a Hierarchical Decision Tree of Rules**  
  Structure the rules in a decision tree format to systematically classify modifiers:
  - Start with broad features (e.g., aromatic vs. aliphatic).
  - Branch into more specific descriptors (e.g., presence of electron-withdrawing groups).
  - Use the tree to assign high or low yield predictions based on path followed.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Rules with Cross-Validation**  
  Test the revised rules against the dataset:
  - Use cross-validation to assess the predictive accuracy.
  - Adjust rules based on misclassifications or inconsistencies.
  - Iterate the process to improve the robustness of the rules.

**Start of Advice**
- **Advice 1**: Simplify the rules by focusing on molecular features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. Replace qualitative descriptions with specific functional groups or structural motifs that are computationally identifiable.

- **Advice 2**: Develop a standardized list of functional groups and assign them numerical descriptors (e.g., electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (-NO₂) = 1, electron-donating groups like methyl (-CH₃) = -1). This allows for easy generation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: Rewrite the rules to emphasize the presence or absence of specific functional groups and their positions relative to the carboxylic acid group. For example:
  - **Revised Rule**: Modifiers with an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., -NO₂, -CN, -CF₃) directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a high yield.
  - **Revised Rule**: Modifiers with an electron-donating group (e.g., -OH, -OCH₃, -NH₂) directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a low yield.

- **Advice 4**: Define rules based on quantifiable properties such as:
  - **Number of carboxyl groups**: Modifiers with multiple carboxyl groups result in high yield.
  - **Chain length**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons) without additional functional groups result in high yield.
  - **Presence of heteroatoms**: Modifiers containing heteroatoms (N, O, S) within aromatic rings or close to the carboxyl group can affect yield.

- **Advice 5**: Incorporate SMARTS patterns to identify substructures within the SMILES strings. For example, use SMARTS to detect:
  - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing substituents: `[#6]1:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:1-[#7,#8,#16]=O`
  - Alpha-amino acids with additional carboxyl groups: `N[C@@H](C(=O)O)C(=O)O`

- **Advice 6**: Create a feature matrix where each feature represents the presence (1) or absence (0) of a specific functional group or structural motif. This binary representation simplifies the numerical analysis.

- **Advice 7**: Assign numerical values to steric and electronic properties using established scales (e.g., Taft steric parameters, Hammett sigma constants). This quantifies concepts like "steric hindrance" and "electron-withdrawing/donating effects."

- **Advice 8**: Group modifiers based on easily identifiable structural classes, such as:
  - **Aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents at the para position**
  - **Alpha-amino acids with acidic/basic/hydrophobic side chains**
  - **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with varying chain lengths and functional groups**

- **Advice 9**: Develop new rules by analyzing the dataset for patterns. For instance:
  - Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains generally result in low yield due to decreased electron density; thus, include a rule for the presence of fluorine atoms reducing yield.
  - Modifiers with thiol groups near the carboxyl group improve coordination and result in high yield; include a rule highlighting the positive effect of nearby thiol groups.

- **Advice 10**: Utilize computational chemistry software to calculate molecular descriptors (e.g., LogP, polar surface area, molecular weight) for each modifier. Incorporate these descriptors into the rules to provide a numerical basis.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with lactone or diketone rings**, providing additional carbonyl groups for metal coordination, result in a **high yield**. The additional carbonyl groups enhance binding affinity to the metal center. An example is **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with aromatic rings attached via longer aliphatic chains (four or more carbons)** result in a **high yield**. The extended chain reduces steric hindrance while allowing favorable interactions. Examples include **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without an intervening linker** result in a **low yield**. Direct conjugation may cause steric hindrance and reduce flexibility for effective coordination. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with sulfur-containing groups at the para position**, such as **sulfanyl**, result in a **low yield**. Sulfur groups may not coordinate effectively with the metal center and can introduce steric hindrance. An example is **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **
- **Advice 1**: Transform the qualitative descriptors in the current rules into quantitative molecular descriptors that can be numerically represented. For instance, replace terms like "strong electron-withdrawing groups" with quantifiable parameters such as Hammett sigma constants or inductive effects, enabling a numerical feature matrix generation.

- **Advice 2**: Utilize cheminformatics software to calculate a comprehensive set of molecular descriptors for each modifier. These descriptors can include electronic properties (e.g., HOMO-LUMO gap, partial charges), steric factors (e.g., molecular volume, steric hindrance parameters), and physicochemical properties (e.g., pKa, logP). This approach facilitates the creation of a numeric feature matrix directly from the SMILES representations.

- **Advice 3**: Simplify and consolidate the current rules by identifying and focusing on key structural features that significantly influence the yield. Encode these features into binary or numerical variables (e.g., presence of a nitro group = 1, absence = 0), which can be easily incorporated into a numerical dataset for modeling.

- **Advice 4**: Reframe the rules to minimize overlaps and redundancies by grouping similar functional groups and their effects. For example, instead of separate rules for different electron-withdrawing groups, create a unified rule that quantifies the electron-withdrawing capacity of substituents using numerical values.

- **Advice 5**: Incorporate steric parameters into the rules by quantifying the size and shape of substituents using descriptors like Charton steric parameters or molar refractivity. This addition will help capture the impact of steric hindrance on yield in a quantifiable manner.

- **Advice 6**: Apply machine learning techniques to analyze the relationship between the calculated molecular descriptors and the reaction yield. This data-driven approach can uncover hidden patterns and lead to the development of more accurate and predictive rules.

- **Advice 7**: Ensure that the modified rules are consistent and mutually exclusive where possible. This can be achieved by creating a hierarchical decision tree or a scoring system where each molecular feature contributes to a cumulative score predicting high or low yield.

- **Advice 8**: Consider the inclusion of 3D molecular descriptors, such as molecular surface area and volume, to account for spatial factors affecting metal coordination and catalytic activity. These descriptors can provide additional insights not captured by 2D representations.

- **Advice 9**: Validate and refine the new quantitative rules using statistical methods like regression analysis or cross-validation with the existing dataset. This process will help in assessing the predictive power and reliability of the rules.

- **Advice 10**: Document and standardize the process of descriptor calculation and rule application to ensure reproducibility and ease of use for future rule generation and updates.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Electron-Withdrawing and Electron-Donating Effects**  
  Replace qualitative descriptions of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups with quantifiable parameters, such as Hammett sigma constants or partial charges. This allows for numerical representation of electronic effects in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Standardize Functional Group Representation**  
  Define clear numerical features based on the presence and position of specific functional groups. For example, create binary indicators (1 or 0) for the presence of nitro groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, etc., at specific positions (e.g., para, meta, ortho) relative to the carboxylic acid group.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Steric Parameters**  
  Include numerical steric parameters such as the Taft steric substituent constant or molecular volume. This quantifies steric hindrance which affects metal coordination and can be derived from molecular descriptors.

- **Advice 4**: **Define Coordination Number and Distance**  
  Quantify the number of potential coordinating atoms (e.g., N, O, S) within a specific distance from the carboxyl group. Use cheminformatics tools to calculate the number of coordinating groups within a three-bond radius, allowing for numerical comparison.

- **Advice 5**: **Simplify and Consolidate Rules Based on Chemical Families**  
  Group similar modifiers into categories and assign numerical codes. For example, aromatic carboxylic acids with additional coordinating heteroatoms can be assigned a code, making it easier to create a feature matrix and reducing redundancy in the rules.

- **Advice 6**: **Utilize Molecular Descriptors from SMILES**  
  Extract numerical molecular descriptors directly from SMILES strings using cheminformatics software. Descriptors may include molecular weight, LogP, topological polar surface area (TPSA), and counts of specific atom types or bonds.

- **Advice 7**: **Encode Chain Lengths Numerically**  
  For aliphatic chains, include the exact number of carbons in the chain as a numerical feature. This allows for direct comparison of chain length effects on yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Quantify the Position of Functional Groups**  
  Instead of qualitative terms like "within three carbons," specify the exact position of functional groups relative to the carboxyl group. This enables precise numerical encoding in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 9**: **Include pKa Values of Modifiers**  
  Since acidity affects metal coordination, include the pKa of the carboxylic acid group as a numerical feature. This can be calculated or obtained from databases.

- **Advice 10**: **Integrate Electronegativity and Dipole Moments**  
  Incorporate calculated electronegativity and molecular dipole moment as features. These properties influence metal coordination and can be numerically compared.

   - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) – has an amino group at the α-position and a side-chain carboxyl group.
   - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** – contains a thiol group three carbons from the carboxyl group.
   - **5-aminopentanoic acid** – has an amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **alpha-amino acids with side chains containing acidic or coordinating functional groups**, such as **carboxyl**, **hydroxyl**, or **heterocycles**, result in a **high yield**. These groups facilitate strong coordination with the metal center. Examples include:
   - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) – possesses a side-chain carboxyl group.
   - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) – contains an indole ring capable of coordination.
   - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) – features multiple hydroxyl groups.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro**, **halomethyl**, or **cyano** groups, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – contains a strong electron-withdrawing nitro group.
   - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** – has a halomethyl group at the para position.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl**, **methoxy**, or **hydroxyl** groups, result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, weakening metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – features a methyl group at the para position.
   - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** – possesses a para-hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups fail to participate effectively in coordination due to the increased chain length. Examples include:
   - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** – amino group is four carbons away from the carboxyl group.
   - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – amino group is five carbons away from the carboxyl group.
   - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – hydroxyl group is four carbons away from the carboxyl group.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing rings capable of metal coordination**, such as **pyridine** or **pyrazole**, result in a **high yield**. The lone pair electrons on nitrogen enhance coordination with the metal center. Examples include:
   - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) – a pyridine ring with a carboxyl group at the 3-position.
   - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** – contains a pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen atoms.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the para position** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or hinder metal coordination through steric or electronic effects. Examples include:
   - **4-formylbenzoic acid** – aldehyde group at the para position.
   - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** – aldehyde group adjacent to the carboxyl group.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position** result in a **high yield**. The amino group can act as an additional coordinating site, enhancing metal binding. Example:
   - **4-aminobenzoic acid** – amino group at the para position.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with extended alkyl chains (six or more carbons) without additional functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The long hydrophobic chains may favor catalyst-substrate interactions without hindering coordination. Example:
   - **Octanoic acid** – eight-carbon saturated fatty acid.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **long flexible chains with multiple ether linkages**, such as **polyether carboxylic acids**, result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric hindrance of ether chains reduce effective coordination with the metal center. Examples include:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** – triethylene glycol monomethyl ether with a carboxylate end.
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** – contains multiple ether linkages and an amino group distant from the carboxyl group.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids or those with multiple fluorine atoms** result in a **low yield**. Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination. Example:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** – heavily fluorinated pentanoic acid.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids connected to another aromatic ring through a short aliphatic linker (three or four carbons)** result in a **high yield**. The aliphatic linker reduces steric hindrance and allows for flexible coordination. Examples include:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** – aromatic ring connected via a pentanoic chain.
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** – pyridine ring linked through a butanoic acid chain.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without an aliphatic linker** result in a **low yield**. Direct conjugation can cause steric hindrance or electronic interference with metal coordination. Example:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – two aromatic rings directly connected.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **thiol groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids** result in a **low yield**. Thiol groups may form disulfide bonds or interact unfavorably with the metal center. Example:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** – thiol group at the para position.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups attached to the carbon chain**, capable of forming chelate rings with metals, result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyls enhance coordination and stability of the metal complex. Examples include:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) – multiple hydroxyl groups along the chain.
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** – features several hydroxyl groups and an ether linkage near the carboxyl group.

**End of Rules**

These rules capture the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the resulting high or low yields in the reaction. They consider the proximity and type of functional groups that can coordinate with the metal center, the electronic effects of substituents on aromatic rings, and the impact of steric hindrance on metal coordination. By applying these rules, one can predict the expected yield outcome for new modifiers based on their structural attributes.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and specifies that carboxylic acids with additional coordinating groups (amino, hydroxyl, or thiol) within three carbons of the carboxyl group result in a high yield. The property insight is strong, as proximal coordinating groups enhance metal binding through chelation, increasing catalyst efficiency. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple data points, such as aspartic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid. This rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 addresses alpha-amino acids with side chains containing acidic or coordinating functional groups leading to a high yield. The clarity is good, though specifying the exact functional groups could improve it. The property insight is solid, highlighting the role of side-chain functional groups in metal coordination. It involves combinations of substructures and is supported by examples like glutamic acid and tryptophan. This rule has strong coverage and provides valuable insights.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in a high yield. The property insight is sound, as electron-withdrawing groups increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing metal coordination. It is a simple rule with high clarity and is supported by data points like 4-nitrobenzoic acid. This rule effectively combines simplicity with good coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position lead to a low yield. The clarity is excellent, and the property insight is logical, considering that electron-donating groups reduce acidity and weaken metal coordination. Supported by examples such as 4-methylbenzoic acid, this rule is straightforward and well-supported, contributing to the balance of the rule set.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 indicates that modifiers with amino or hydroxyl groups more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group result in a low yield. The rule is clear, emphasizing the importance of the proximity of coordinating groups. The property insight is valid, as distant functional groups are less effective in coordination. It is supported by data points like 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid. This rule effectively addresses complexity by considering the spatial arrangement within the molecule.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 explains that heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing rings capable of metal coordination result in a high yield. The clarity is good, and the property insight is strong, recognizing the role of nitrogen lone pairs in enhancing coordination. It considers specific substructures and is supported by modifiers like nicotinic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid. This rule adds valuable diversity to the rule set.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the para position result in a low yield. The clarity is adequate, though elaborating on the side reactions or steric effects could enhance understanding. The property insight is reasonable, suggesting that aldehyde groups may hinder coordination. Supported by examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid, this rule has sufficient coverage but could benefit from additional data points for stronger support.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position result in a high yield. The clarity is excellent, and the property insight is strong, as amino groups can act as additional coordinating sites. Supported by data like 4-aminobenzoic acid, this rule is simple, well-supported, and contributes to the overall balance.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 indicates that aliphatic carboxylic acids with extended alkyl chains (six or more carbons) without additional functional groups result in a high yield. The clarity is acceptable, though the property insight could be stronger, as the role of hydrophobic interactions needs clearer justification. Supported by octanoic acid, this rule has limited coverage with only one data point, suggesting a need for more examples to strengthen it.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that modifiers with long flexible chains containing multiple ether linkages result in a low yield. The clarity is good, and the property insight is valid, as flexibility and steric hindrance can reduce effective coordination. Supported by data points like triethylene glycol derivatives, this rule effectively combines complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 explains that perfluorinated carboxylic acids or those with multiple fluorine atoms result in a low yield. The clarity is excellent, and the property insight is reasonable, considering fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effects. However, with limited data points like nonafluoropentanoic acid, the coverage is low. Additional supporting data would enhance the reliability of this rule.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids connected to another aromatic ring through a short aliphatic linker result in a high yield. The clarity is acceptable, though the structural complexity requires careful interpretation. The property insight is plausible, as the linker may reduce steric hindrance. Supported by modifiers like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, this rule introduces useful complexity but would benefit from more data points for stronger coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without an aliphatic linker result in a low yield. The clarity is good, and the property insight is logical due to potential steric hindrance and electronic effects. Supported by 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, this rule has acceptable coverage and adds to the rule set's balance.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 indicates that modifiers with thiol groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids result in a low yield. The clarity is excellent, and the property insight is reasonable, considering thiol groups may interfere with coordination or form disulfide bonds. However, with limited data points like 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, the coverage is low, and additional examples would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 explains that carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups attached to the carbon chain, capable of forming chelate rings with metals, result in a high yield. The clarity is good, and the property insight is strong, as multiple hydroxyls can enhance coordination. Supported by data like gluconic acid, this rule effectively combines complexity with sufficient coverage.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with additional coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, or thiol) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. Proximal coordinating groups enhance binding to the metal center by chelation, increasing catalyst efficiency. Examples include:
   - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) – has an amino group at the α-position and a side-chain carboxyl group.
   - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** – contains a thiol group three carbons from the carboxyl group.
   - **5-aminopentanoic acid** – has an amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **alpha-amino acids with side chains containing acidic or coordinating functional groups**, such as **carboxyl**, **hydroxyl**, or **heterocycles**, result in a **high yield**. These groups facilitate strong coordination with the metal center. Examples include:
   - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) – possesses a side-chain carboxyl group.
   - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) – contains an indole ring capable of coordination.
   - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) – features multiple hydroxyl groups.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro**, **halomethyl**, or **cyano** groups, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – contains a strong electron-withdrawing nitro group.
   - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** – has a halomethyl group at the para position.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl**, **methoxy**, or **hydroxyl** groups, result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, weakening metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – features a methyl group at the para position.
   - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** – possesses a para-hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups fail to participate effectively in coordination due to the increased chain length. Examples include:
   - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** – amino group is four carbons away from the carboxyl group.
   - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – amino group is five carbons away from the carboxyl group.
   - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – hydroxyl group is four carbons away from the carboxyl group.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing rings capable of metal coordination**, such as **pyridine** or **pyrazole**, result in a **high yield**. The lone pair electrons on nitrogen enhance coordination with the metal center. Examples include:
   - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) – a pyridine ring with a carboxyl group at the 3-position.
   - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** – contains a pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen atoms.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the para position** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or hinder metal coordination through steric or electronic effects. Examples include:
   - **4-formylbenzoic acid** – aldehyde group at the para position.
   - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** – aldehyde group adjacent to the carboxyl group.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position** result in a **high yield**. The amino group can act as an additional coordinating site, enhancing metal binding. Example:
   - **4-aminobenzoic acid** – amino group at the para position.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with extended alkyl chains (six or more carbons) without additional functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The long hydrophobic chains may favor catalyst-substrate interactions without hindering coordination. Example:
   - **Octanoic acid** – eight-carbon saturated fatty acid.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **long flexible chains with multiple ether linkages**, such as **polyether carboxylic acids**, result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric hindrance of ether chains reduce effective coordination with the metal center. Examples include:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** – triethylene glycol monomethyl ether with a carboxylate end.
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** – contains multiple ether linkages and an amino group distant from the carboxyl group.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids or those with multiple fluorine atoms** result in a **low yield**. Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination. Example:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** – heavily fluorinated pentanoic acid.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids connected to another aromatic ring through a short aliphatic linker (three or four carbons)** result in a **high yield**. The aliphatic linker reduces steric hindrance and allows for flexible coordination. Examples include:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** – aromatic ring connected via a pentanoic chain.
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** – pyridine ring linked through a butanoic acid chain.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without an aliphatic linker** result in a **low yield**. Direct conjugation can cause steric hindrance or electronic interference with metal coordination. Example:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – two aromatic rings directly connected.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **thiol groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids** result in a **low yield**. Thiol groups may form disulfide bonds or interact unfavorably with the metal center. Example:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** – thiol group at the para position.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups attached to the carbon chain**, capable of forming chelate rings with metals, result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyls enhance coordination and stability of the metal complex. Examples include:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) – multiple hydroxyl groups along the chain.
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** – features several hydroxyl groups and an ether linkage near the carboxyl group.

**End of Rules**

These rules capture the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the resulting high or low yields in the reaction. They consider the proximity and type of functional groups that can coordinate with the metal center, the electronic effects of substituents on aromatic rings, and the impact of steric hindrance on metal coordination. By applying these rules, one can predict the expected yield outcome for new modifiers based on their structural attributes.---------------------------------------------------------------

** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: Revise the `rule1_func` to accurately measure the proximity between the carboxylic acid group and the coordinating group. Instead of counting the number of carbons in the shortest path, count the number of bonds (excluding hydrogens) between the carboxylic acid carbon atom and the coordinating group atom. If the number of bonds is less than or equal to 4 (which corresponds to three carbons away), the function should return 1. This adjustment will prevent over-matching and ensure that only modifiers meeting the specific distance criteria are identified.

- **Suggestion 2**: Modify the path traversal in `rule1_func` to ensure that the shortest path between the carboxylic acid and the coordinating group is along carbon atoms only. Exclude paths that pass through heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur) other than the coordinating group itself. This can be done by checking that each intermediate atom in the path (excluding the start and end atoms) is a carbon atom. This refinement will prevent unintended matches through rings or alternative pathways that do not align with the rule's intent.

- **Suggestion 3**: Re-express the SMARTS patterns for the coordinating functional groups to avoid unintended matches. For instance, the current `amino_group_sma` (`'[NX3;H2,H1;!$(N-*=[O,N,S])]'`) may inadvertently match nitrogen atoms in heterocycles or amides. To prevent this, specify that the amino group is attached to an sp3-hybridized carbon atom not double-bonded to any atom: `'[NX3;H2,H1;!$(N=[!#6]);!$([N]C=O)]'`. Similarly, review and refine the SMARTS patterns for hydroxyl and thiol groups to ensure they match only the intended primary functional groups.

- **Suggestion 4**: Adjust the `rule3_func` and `rule4_func` to properly identify substituents at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids. The current implementation may not accurately locate substituents on the aromatic ring relative to the carboxyl group. Incorporate SMARTS patterns that define the para relationship explicitly. For example, use SMARTS like `'c1ccc(cc1)-C(=O)O'` to identify the aromatic carboxylic acid core, and then check for substituents at the para position by navigating the ring system and identifying groups attached to the atom opposite the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 5**: Utilize more specific and comprehensive SMARTS patterns to capture the entire structural motif described in each rule. For complex rules, write SMARTS that encompass both the functional groups and their spatial relationships. This approach reduces reliance on programmatic path calculations and leverages RDKit's substructure matching capabilities. For example, for Rule 1, a SMARTS pattern that directly matches carboxylic acids with a coordinating group within three carbons can be developed.

- **Suggestion 6**: Include error handling and validation in the code to catch and report molecules that cannot be parsed or do not meet any rules. This can help in diagnosing issues with specific SMILES strings and ensure that the feature matrix accurately reflects the applicability of each rule.

- **Suggestion 7**: Extend the implementation to cover all 15 rules, ensuring that each rule's code is thoroughly tested against known examples and counter-examples. This comprehensive approach will improve the overall effectiveness of the transformation from language rules to the numeric feature matrix.

     - **Iteration 3:** 1.4661
   - **Latest Metric:** 0.9120

---

**Analysis of Current Performance**

- **Initial Improvement:**

  - During the first three iterations, there was a noticeable improvement in both **train confidence** and **train lift** compared to the previous metrics.
    - **Confidence** increased to over **70%**, indicating that when the rule conditions were met, the predictions were correct more than 70% of the time.
    - **Lift** values were significantly above **1**, suggesting a strong positive association between the rule conditions and the predictions.

- **Decline in Latest Metrics:**

  - In the latest iteration, both **train confidence** and **train lift** have decreased:
    - **Confidence** dropped to **46.19%**, which is lower than both the initial iterations and the previous metrics.
    - **Lift** fell below **1** to **0.9120**, indicating that the rule conditions are less effective than random chance in predicting the outcomes.

- **Interpretation:**

  - The initial increase in metrics suggests that the rules were improving in capturing the underlying patterns associated with high yields.
  - The subsequent decline may indicate that the current set of rules has become too broad or includes conflicting conditions that reduce predictive power.
  - A **lift** value less than **1** implies that the presence of the rule conditions actually decreases the likelihood of the predicted outcome, which is undesirable.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum:**

  - The decrease in performance metrics suggests that the optimization process may have reached a local minimum.
  - Continuing to iterate without substantial changes might not lead to further improvements and could reinforce suboptimal rules.

- **Sufficiency of Iterations:**

  - Given the observed decline after initial improvements, it appears that enough iterations have been performed to identify the limitations of the current approach.
  - Further iterations using the same methodology may not yield better results.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Refine Rule Specificity:**

   - **Avoid Overgeneralization:** Ensure that rules are not too broad, which can reduce confidence and lift.
   - **Increase Specificity:** Focus on key structural features that strongly correlate with high yield, even if it reduces support slightly.

2. **Reassess Conflicting Rules:**

   - **Identify Conflicts:** Review the rules for any contradictions or overlaps that might confuse the model.
   - **Prioritize High-Performing Rules:** Emphasize rules that showed higher confidence and lift in earlier iterations.

3. **Feature Importance Analysis:**

   - **Quantitative Analysis:** Use statistical methods to determine which molecular features contribute most to high yield.
   - **Rule Adjustment:** Modify or eliminate rules that are based on features with low importance.

4. **Introduce Test Metrics:**

   - **Validation Set Evaluation:** Apply the rules to a separate validation or test set to evaluate their generalizability.
   - **Monitor Overfitting:** Ensure that high performance on training data is not due to overfitting.

5. **Iterative Rule Development:**

   - **Stepwise Refinement:** Adjust one aspect of the rules at a time to isolate the impact of each change.
   - **Continuous Monitoring:** Keep track of how each modification affects the metrics.

6. **Leverage Domain Expertise:**

   - **Chemical Intuition:** Incorporate insights from chemical reasoning to guide rule formation.
   - **Experimental Data Integration:** Use experimental results to validate or challenge the theoretical rules.

7. **Consider Alternative Models:**

   - **Machine Learning Approaches:** Explore machine learning models that can capture nonlinear relationships.
   - **Hybrid Models:** Combine rule-based methods with statistical models to enhance predictive power.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules initially improved model performance, as indicated by increased confidence and lift values. However, the latest metrics show a decline, suggesting that the model's predictive ability has decreased. To address this, it's recommended to:

- **Refine and prioritize rules** that have consistently shown high performance.
- **Eliminate or modify rules** that contribute to decreased confidence and lift.
- **Incorporate additional analysis techniques** to identify and focus on the most impactful molecular features.
- **Validate the rules** using test datasets to ensure they generalize beyond the training data.

By implementing these strategies, we can enhance the effectiveness of the rules and achieve a better balance between support, confidence, and lift, ultimately improving the predictive accuracy for high-yield outcomes in the catalytic process.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation Set and Train Set:**

The latest 5-fold validation accuracy obtained is **0.4857**, which is significantly lower than the previous validation accuracies, which were consistently around **0.76**. This sharp decline indicates that the current set of rules used to generate the feature matrix is less effective than before. The model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen validation data has diminished, suggesting issues with the current rules and potential underfitting.

**Analysis Based on the SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

In the current iteration, the SHAP analysis reveals that only **Rule 2** is contributing to the model's predictions, with SHAP values provided for **Rule 2** across all molecules. This is a departure from previous iterations where multiple rules were active, indicating that the feature matrix has become overly simplified.

Let's examine specific cases from the SHAP analysis:

1. **Underestimation Cases (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**
   - **Molecules Affected:**
     - C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
     - C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O
     - C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N
     - C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O
   - **Observation:**
     - **Rule 2 SHAP values** are approximately zero or negative (e.g., -1.3552527156068805e-17), contributing negatively to the prediction of high loading.
   - **Implication:**
     - **Rule 2** is underestimating the loading for these molecules, leading to false negatives.

2. **Overestimation Cases (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**
   - **Molecules Affected:**
     - CC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
     - C(CCCN)CCC(=O)O
   - **Observation:**
     - **Rule 2 SHAP values** are positive (e.g., 0.019999999999999858, 0.041208791208790695), contributing positively to the prediction of high loading.
   - **Implication:**
     - **Rule 2** is overestimating the loading for these molecules, leading to false positives.

**Evaluation of Rule Effectiveness:**

- **Current Rule Set Limitations:**
  - The reliance on a single rule (**Rule 2**) signifies an oversimplification of the feature matrix.
  - The drastic reduction in rules from previous iterations has led to the model losing critical information needed to make accurate predictions.
  - The negative impact of **Rule 2** on both underestimation and overestimation cases indicates that the rule may be too broad or not well-defined.

- **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
  - The decreased validation accuracy suggests **underfitting**, where the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
  - The model lacks the complexity required to differentiate between modifiers that result in high or low loading effectively.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Reintroduce and Refine Previous Effective Rules:**
   - **Action:**
     - Bring back rules from previous iterations that contributed to higher accuracies (e.g., **Rules 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8**, etc.).
   - **Rationale:**
     - Multiple rules capturing different molecular features improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce reliance on a single rule.

2. **Refine Rule 2 to Reduce Misclassifications:**
   - **Issue with Rule 2:**
     - It currently states that modifiers which are **alpha-amino acids with side chains containing acidic or coordinating functional groups** result in a **high yield**.
     - This may be too inclusive and not account for exceptions where such modifiers lead to low yield.
   - **Suggested Refinements:**
     - **Introduce Specificity:**
       - Add conditions to **Rule 2** to specify which functional groups or structural contexts truly lead to high yields.
     - **Consider Side Chain Length and Sterics:**
       - Exclude alpha-amino acids with bulky side chains that may hinder coordination.
     - **Account for Electronic Effects:**
       - Differentiate between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups in side chains.

3. **Analyze and Adjust Rules Based on SHAP Values:**
   - **For Overestimations (High SHAP Values Leading to False Positives):**
     - **Rule 2** contributes to overestimations with positive SHAP values.
     - **Action:**
       - Modify **Rule 2** to be less permissive, potentially excluding certain structures that consistently lead to low experimental loading despite fitting the rule.
   - **For Underestimations (Negative SHAP Values Leading to False Negatives):**
     - **Rule 2** contributes to underestimations with negative SHAP values.
     - **Action:**
       - Expand **Rule 2** to include additional functional groups or structural features that were previously omitted but lead to high loading.

4. **Introduce New Rules to Capture Missing Patterns:**
   - **Consider Other Functional Groups:**
     - Introduce rules for modifiers with functional groups like sulfones, phosphates, or halogens if relevant to the dataset.
   - **Incorporate Steric and Electronic Factors:**
     - Develop rules that account for steric hindrance and electronic effects not covered by existing rules.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Rule for Bulky Side Chains:**
       - Modifiers with bulky substituents near the coordination site result in low yield due to steric hindrance.
     - **Rule for Multiple Coordination Sites:**
       - Modifiers with multiple potential coordination sites (e.g., di-acids, tri-acids) may result in higher yields due to stronger binding.

5. **Balance Rule Complexity and Generalization:**
   - **Avoid Over-Complicating Rules:**
     - Ensure that rules are not overly specific, which could lead to overfitting.
   - **Ensure Adequate Coverage:**
     - Rules should cover a wide range of modifiers without being too general.

6. **Iterative Testing and Validation:**
   - **Regularly Evaluate Model Performance:**
     - After adjusting rules, retrain the model and assess validation accuracy.
   - **Use SHAP Analysis Continuously:**
     - Identify if new rules introduce new misclassifications and adjust accordingly.

7. **Enhance Feature Matrix Representation:**
   - **Incorporate Quantitative Descriptors:**
     - Use numerical features such as molecular weight, logP, pKa, and polar surface area in addition to rules.
   - **Apply Dimensionality Reduction if Necessary:**
     - If the feature space becomes too large, techniques like PCA can help maintain model performance without overfitting.

8. **Consider Potential Data Issues:**
   - **Review Dataset for Outliers:**
     - Ensure that the misclassifications are not due to data entry errors or outliers.
   - **Balance the Dataset:**
     - If certain classes are underrepresented, it may impact the model's learning.

**Conclusion:**

The current approach, relying solely on **Rule 2**, has led to underfitting and reduced model performance. By reintroducing and refining previous rules, particularly focusing on adjusting **Rule 2**, we can enhance the model's predictive ability. Incorporating a diverse set of well-defined rules and continually refining them based on SHAP analysis will improve the accuracy and generalizability of the model.

**Next Steps:**

- **Refine Existing Rules:**
  - Modify **Rule 2** based on the recommendations.
- **Reintroduce Other Rules:**
  - Bring back and possibly adjust other rules that were effective in previous iterations.
- **Validate Changes:**
  - Retrain the model and perform validation to assess improvements.
- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Use SHAP analysis after each iteration to guide further refinements.

By following these steps, we aim to develop a robust set of rules that accurately capture the relationship between molecular modifier structures and their catalytic performance, ultimately improving the model's accuracy and reliability.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The initial iterations of rule development showed promising improvements in model performance, as evidenced by increased train confidence and lift values. However, the latest metrics indicate a decline in predictive accuracy:

- **Train confidence** decreased to **46%**, and **train lift** fell below **1**.
- **Validation accuracy** dropped significantly to **48.57%**, compared to previous accuracies around **76%**.
- **SHAP analysis** revealed that only **Rule 2** is contributing to the model's predictions, leading to underfitting.
- **Rule 2** is causing both overestimations and underestimations in predictions, indicating it is too broad or not well-defined.

This decline suggests that the current rules have become less effective, possibly due to overgeneralization or conflicting conditions. The model is underfitting, lacking the complexity needed to accurately capture the relationship between molecular modifiers and catalytic yield.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Refine Rule 1 for Accurate Proximity Measurement**

   - **Adjust Distance Measurement**: Revise the `rule1_func` to count the number of bonds (excluding hydrogens) between the carboxylic acid carbon atom and the coordinating group atom.
   - **Path Constraints**: Ensure that the path consists primarily of carbon atoms, excluding paths that pass through unintended heteroatoms.
   - **Outcome**: This refinement will prevent over-matching and accurately identify modifiers that meet the specific distance criteria.

2. **Modify Functional Group SMARTS Patterns**

   - **Prevent Unintended Matches**: Re-express the SMARTS patterns for amino, hydroxyl, and thiol groups to avoid matching unintended structures like heterocycles or amides.
   - **Example**: For amino groups, use `'[NX3;H2,H1;!$(N=[!#6]);!$([N]C=O)]'` to match only primary or secondary amines attached to sp³-hybridized carbons.
   - **Outcome**: This will enhance the specificity of the rules and reduce false positives or negatives.

3. **Adjust Rules for Aromatic Substituents (Rules 3 and 4)**

   - **Precisely Identify Para Substituents**: Incorporate SMARTS patterns that explicitly define the para relationship in aromatic carboxylic acids.
   - **Implementation**: Use substructure matching to locate substituents directly opposite the carboxyl group on the aromatic ring.
   - **Outcome**: This ensures accurate identification of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups impacting the yield.

4. **Utilize Specific and Comprehensive SMARTS Patterns**

   - **Capture Structural Motifs**: Develop SMARTS patterns that encompass both functional groups and their spatial relationships for each rule.
   - **Leverage RDKit Capabilities**: Use RDKit's substructure matching to reduce reliance on programmatic path calculations.
   - **Outcome**: This increases the precision of rule application across the dataset.

5. **Reintroduce and Refine Previous Effective Rules**

   - **Bring Back Prior Rules**: Reinstate rules from earlier iterations that contributed to higher accuracies, such as Rules 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
   - **Test and Validate**: Ensure each rule is thoroughly tested against known examples and counter-examples.
   - **Outcome**: A comprehensive set of well-defined rules will improve model performance.

6. **Refine Rule 2 to Reduce Misclassifications**

   - **Increase Specificity**: Narrow down the scope of Rule 2 to specify which side-chain functional groups in alpha-amino acids contribute to high yield.
   - **Consider Steric and Electronic Factors**: Exclude bulky side chains or electron-donating groups that may hinder coordination.
   - **Outcome**: This adjustment will reduce both overestimations and underestimations caused by Rule 2.

7. **Analyze and Adjust Rules Based on SHAP Values**

   - **Identify Patterns**: Use SHAP analysis to determine which rules contribute positively or negatively to predictions.
   - **Modify Rules Accordingly**: Adjust or eliminate rules that consistently lead to incorrect predictions.
   - **Outcome**: Enhances the model's accuracy by focusing on impactful features.

8. **Introduce New Rules to Capture Missing Patterns**

   - **Address Gaps**: Develop rules for modifiers with functional groups or structural features not currently accounted for, such as sulfones or multiple coordination sites.
   - **Outcome**: Capturing a broader range of molecular features will improve prediction accuracy.

9. **Balance Rule Complexity and Generalization**

   - **Avoid Overfitting**: Ensure that rules are neither too broad nor too specific.
   - **Maintain Coverage**: Rules should apply to a wide range of relevant modifiers without being overly restrictive.
   - **Outcome**: A balanced rule set will generalize better to unseen data.

10. **Enhance Feature Matrix Representation**

    - **Incorporate Quantitative Descriptors**: Add numerical features such as molecular weight, logP, pKa, and polar surface area.
    - **Use Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) if necessary.
    - **Outcome**: A richer feature set may capture nuances missed by categorical rules alone.

11. **Iterative Testing and Validation**

    - **Regular Evaluation**: Retrain the model after each rule adjustment and assess performance using validation sets.
    - **Continuous SHAP Analysis**: Use SHAP values to guide further refinements.
    - **Outcome**: Iterative improvement ensures the model remains accurate and generalizable.

12. **Leverage Domain Expertise**

    - **Chemical Intuition**: Incorporate insights from chemistry to guide rule formation and refinement.
    - **Experimental Data Integration**: Validate rules with experimental results to ensure they reflect real-world outcomes.
    - **Outcome**: Domain knowledge enhances the relevance and effectiveness of the rules.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Underfitting Issues**: The current model suffers from underfitting, relying too heavily on a single rule (Rule 2) and lacking complexity.
- **Rule Refinement**: By refining existing rules and reintroducing previously effective ones, the model can better capture the underlying patterns in the data.
- **Controlled Complexity**: Introducing additional well-defined rules and quantitative features increases model capacity without overcomplicating it.
- **Validation Protocols**: Regular testing on validation sets and careful monitoring of performance metrics will prevent overfitting.

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with additional coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, or thiol) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. Proximal coordinating groups enhance binding to the metal center by chelation, increasing catalyst efficiency. Examples include:
   - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) – has an amino group at the α-position and a side-chain carboxyl group.
   - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** – contains a thiol group three carbons from the carboxyl group.
   - **5-aminopentanoic acid** – has an amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **alpha-amino acids with side chains containing acidic or coordinating functional groups**, such as **carboxyl**, **hydroxyl**, or **heterocycles**, result in a **high yield**. These groups facilitate strong coordination with the metal center. Examples include:
   - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) – possesses a side-chain carboxyl group.
   - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) – contains an indole ring capable of coordination.
   - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) – features multiple hydroxyl groups.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro**, **halomethyl**, or **cyano** groups, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – contains a strong electron-withdrawing nitro group.
   - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** – has a halomethyl group at the para position.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl**, **methoxy**, or **hydroxyl** groups, result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, weakening metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – features a methyl group at the para position.
   - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** – possesses a para-hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups fail to participate effectively in coordination due to the increased chain length. Examples include:
   - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** – amino group is four carbons away from the carboxyl group.
   - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – amino group is five carbons away from the carboxyl group.
   - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – hydroxyl group is four carbons away from the carboxyl group.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing rings capable of metal coordination**, such as **pyridine** or **pyrazole**, result in a **high yield**. The lone pair electrons on nitrogen enhance coordination with the metal center. Examples include:
   - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) – a pyridine ring with a carboxyl group at the 3-position.
   - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** – contains a pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen atoms.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the para position** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or hinder metal coordination through steric or electronic effects. Examples include:
   - **4-formylbenzoic acid** – aldehyde group at the para position.
   - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** – aldehyde group adjacent to the carboxyl group.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position** result in a **high yield**. The amino group can act as an additional coordinating site, enhancing metal binding. Example:
   - **4-aminobenzoic acid** – amino group at the para position.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with extended alkyl chains (six or more carbons) without additional functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The long hydrophobic chains may favor catalyst-substrate interactions without hindering coordination. Example:
   - **Octanoic acid** – eight-carbon saturated fatty acid.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **long flexible chains with multiple ether linkages**, such as **polyether carboxylic acids**, result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric hindrance of ether chains reduce effective coordination with the metal center. Examples include:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** – triethylene glycol monomethyl ether with a carboxylate end.
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** – contains multiple ether linkages and an amino group distant from the carboxyl group.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids or those with multiple fluorine atoms** result in a **low yield**. Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination. Example:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** – heavily fluorinated pentanoic acid.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids connected to another aromatic ring through a short aliphatic linker (three or four carbons)** result in a **high yield**. The aliphatic linker reduces steric hindrance and allows for flexible coordination. Examples include:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** – aromatic ring connected via a pentanoic chain.
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** – pyridine ring linked through a butanoic acid chain.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without an aliphatic linker** result in a **low yield**. Direct conjugation can cause steric hindrance or electronic interference with metal coordination. Example:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – two aromatic rings directly connected.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **thiol groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids** result in a **low yield**. Thiol groups may form disulfide bonds or interact unfavorably with the metal center. Example:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** – thiol group at the para position.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups attached to the carbon chain**, capable of forming chelate rings with metals, result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyls enhance coordination and stability of the metal complex. Examples include:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) – multiple hydroxyl groups along the chain.
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** – features several hydroxyl groups and an ether linkage near the carboxyl group.

**End of Rules**

These rules capture the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the resulting high or low yields in the reaction. They consider the proximity and type of functional groups that can coordinate with the metal center, the electronic effects of substituents on aromatic rings, and the impact of steric hindrance on metal coordination. By applying these rules, one can predict the expected yield outcome for new modifiers based on their structural attributes.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- ** Advice 1 **: **Refine Rule 1 by precisely measuring the proximity of coordinating groups to the carboxylic acid group**. Adjust the rule to count the number of bonds (excluding hydrogens) between the carbon atom of the carboxylic acid and the atom of the coordinating group (amino, hydroxyl, or thiol). Ensure that the path between these atoms consists only of carbon atoms to prevent unintended matches through rings or heteroatoms. This will accurately identify modifiers where coordinating groups are within three carbons of the carboxyl group, enhancing the specificity of the rule.

- ** Advice 2 **: **Modify SMARTS patterns for functional groups to prevent unintended matches**. Update the SMARTS patterns for amino, hydroxyl, and thiol groups to match only the intended functional groups attached to sp³-hybridized carbons. For example:
  - **Amino Group**: Use `'[NX3;H2,H1;!$(N=[!#6]);!$([N]C=O)]'` to match primary or secondary amines not adjacent to carbonyl or heterocyclic structures.
  - **Hydroxyl Group**: Use `'[$([OX2H]);!$([O][#7]),!$([O][#8]),!$([O][#16])]'` to match hydroxyl groups not part of carboxylic acids or other oxyanions.
  - **Thiol Group**: Use `'[SX2H]'` to match thiol groups attached to sp³ carbons.
  This will prevent false positives from structures like amides, heterocycles, or other unintended functionalities.

- ** Advice 3 **: **Adjust Rules 3 and 4 to precisely identify para substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids**. Use SMARTS patterns that explicitly define substituents at the para position relative to the carboxyl group on an aromatic ring. For example, use a SMARTS pattern like `'c1cc([C](=O)[O-])ccc1[X]'`, where `[X]` represents the substituent, to match only para-substituted benzoic acids. This ensures accurate identification of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups affecting the yield.

- ** Advice 4 **: **Utilize specific and comprehensive SMARTS patterns to capture structural motifs and spatial relationships**. Leverage RDKit's substructure matching capabilities to define SMARTS patterns that encompass both the functional groups and their positions relative to each other. For example, for Rule 6 (heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing rings), use SMARTS patterns that match pyridine or pyrazole rings with carboxylic acid groups in specific positions conducive to metal coordination.

- ** Advice 5 **: **Reintroduce and refine previously effective rules to enhance model performance**. Bring back prior rules that contributed to higher accuracies, such as Rules 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Test each rule thoroughly against known examples and counter-examples in the dataset to ensure they are correctly classified. Refine the rules as necessary based on this testing to improve their specificity and effectiveness.

- ** Advice 6 **: **Refine Rule 2 to reduce misclassifications by narrowing its scope and increasing specificity**. Specify which side-chain functional groups in alpha-amino acids contribute to a high yield, focusing on those with coordinating groups that enhance metal binding without significant steric hindrance. Exclude bulky side chains or those with electron-donating groups that may hinder coordination. This will reduce overestimations and underestimations caused by the current broad definition of Rule 2.

- ** Advice 7 **: **Analyze SHAP values to identify and adjust rules impacting model predictions**. Use SHAP analysis to determine which rules contribute positively or negatively to the predictions. If a rule consistently leads to incorrect predictions, modify or eliminate it. For instance, if a rule is too broad and causes misclassifications, refine its conditions to be more specific based on the structural features of the modifiers.

- ** Advice 8 **: **Introduce new rules to capture missing patterns not currently addressed**. Develop rules for modifiers with functional groups or structural features such as sulfones, sulfonamides, or multiple coordination sites that may affect yield but are not covered by existing rules. For example, create a rule for modifiers containing sulfonic acids or phosphonic acids, which may have strong metal-coordinating abilities.

- ** Advice 9 **: **Balance rule complexity to avoid overfitting and underfitting**. Ensure that the rules are neither too broad (leading to underfitting) nor too specific (leading to overfitting). Each rule should apply to a meaningful subset of modifiers without being overly restrictive. Regularly validate the rules against the dataset to maintain this balance.

- ** Advice 10 **: **Iteratively test and validate the refined and new rules to ensure improved performance**. After adjusting or adding each rule, retrain the model and assess its performance using the validation set. Monitor metrics such as training confidence, validation accuracy, and SHAP values. This iterative process ensures that the rules contribute positively to the model and improve its predictive accuracy.

** End of Advice **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with an amino group (primary or secondary amine) located on the alpha or beta carbon** result in a **high yield**. The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylate allows for **chelation** with the metal center, enhancing catalyst efficiency. Examples include:
   - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) – amino group at the α-position.
   - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) – amino group at the α-position.
   - **5-aminopentanoic acid** – amino group within close proximity to the carboxylate.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro** or **halomethyl** groups, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination through stronger ionic interactions. Examples include:
   - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – nitro group at the para position.
   - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** – bromomethyl group at the para position.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating to metals** result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms provide additional coordination sites, strengthening the interaction with the metal center. Examples include:
   - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) – pyridine nitrogen coordinates with metal.
   - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** – pyrazole ring contains coordinating nitrogen atoms.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups in close proximity to the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance metal binding through **chelation** and increase catalyst stability. Examples include:
   - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) – several hydroxyl groups adjacent to carboxylate.
   - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** – multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with unfunctionalized long hydrophobic chains (six or more carbons)** result in a **high yield**. The lack of steric hindrance near the carboxylate allows effective metal coordination, and hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate-catalyst interactions. Example:
   - **Octanoic acid** – eight-carbon saturated fatty acid.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **amino or hydroxyl groups located more than three carbons away from the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating with the metal center due to reduced orbital overlap and increased conformational freedom. Examples include:
   - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** – amino group four carbons away from carboxylate.
   - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – amino group five carbons away.
   - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – hydroxyl group four carbons away.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl** or **hydroxyl** groups, result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease carboxylate acidity, weakening metal coordination due to reduced ionic character. Examples include:
   - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – methyl group at the para position.
   - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** – para-hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents causing steric hindrance near the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Steric bulk interferes with effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center. Example:
   - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – directly connected aromatic rings create steric hindrance.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **long flexible chains with multiple ether linkages**, such as **polyether carboxylic acids**, result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and size of ether chains reduce effective coordination due to increased entropy and steric factors. Examples include:
   - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** – triethylene glycol chain with terminal carboxylate.
   - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** – ether linkages separate amino and carboxylate groups.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **multiple fluorine atoms attached to the carbon chain** result in a **low yield**. Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination due to decreased basicity. Example:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** – heavily fluorinated pentanoic acid.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the para position** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or alter electronic distribution, hindering metal coordination. Examples include:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** – formyl group at the para position.
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** – formyl group near carboxylate.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with thiol groups located close to the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups coordinate strongly with metals, forming stable complexes that enhance catalytic activity. Example:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** – thiol group near the carboxylate allows chelation.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position** result in a **high yield**. The amino group provides an additional coordination site, strengthening metal binding through chelation. Example:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** – amino group at the para position enhances coordination.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **functional groups capable of forming chelate rings**, such as **ketone or lactone groups adjacent to the carboxylate**, result in a **high yield**. Chelation increases complex stability and catalytic efficiency. Example:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** – lactone ring adjacent to the carboxylate.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that have **extended conjugation with ketone or ether linkages near the carboxylate**, allowing for resonance stabilization and enhanced coordination, result in a **high yield**. These structures facilitate electron delocalization, strengthening metal-ligand interactions. Example:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** – conjugated system with methoxy groups.

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules consider the ability of functional groups to coordinate with the metal center, electronic effects of substituents on acidity and basicity, the impact of steric hindrance, and the formation of stable chelate complexes. By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural features.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is generally clear and provides strong property insight by emphasizing the importance of an amino group at the alpha or beta position for chelation with the metal center, enhancing catalyst efficiency. It is supported by data points such as (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, both resulting in high yield. However, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid, which also has an amino group at the α-position but includes a bulky aromatic group at the β-position, results in a low yield. This suggests that the presence of bulky substituents adjacent to the amino group might interfere with chelation, indicating the rule may need refinement to account for steric hindrance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and offers good property insight by explaining how electron-withdrawing groups at the para position enhance the acidity of the carboxylate, strengthening metal coordination. It is well-supported by data points like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, both yielding high. There are no contradictory examples in the dataset, indicating strong coverage and reliability of the rule.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and provides adequate property insight into the role of nitrogen-containing heterocycles in metal coordination. It is supported by data points such as pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, both resulting in high yield. However, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yields low, possibly due to steric hindrance or the nitrogen's position relative to the carboxylate. This suggests the rule may benefit from specifying the importance of nitrogen atom positioning within the ring and proximity to the carboxylate group.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and provides strong property insight by highlighting how multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate enhance metal binding through chelation. It is supported by data points like gluconic acid and the polyhydroxylated acetic acid derivative, both yielding high. There are no contradicting examples, indicating good coverage and effectiveness of the rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is somewhat clear and provides modest property insight by suggesting that unfunctionalized long hydrophobic chains allow effective metal coordination due to minimal steric hindrance near the carboxylate. However, its coverage is limited to a single data point (octanoic acid), with no additional examples to strengthen the rule. This limits the confidence in its general applicability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and offers solid property insight by explaining that amino or hydroxyl groups located more than three carbons away from the carboxylate are less effective in coordinating with the metal center. It is well-supported by multiple data points, including 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, all resulting in low yield. This demonstrates strong coverage and validates the rule.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and provides good property insight by indicating that electron-donating groups at the para position reduce carboxylate acidity and weaken metal coordination. It is supported by data points like 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, both yielding low. However, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yields high, which may seem contradictory. This discrepancy suggests that the rule applies specifically when the electron-donating group is directly attached to the aromatic ring bearing the carboxylate, and the rule may need to specify this limitation for clarity.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and offers adequate property insight into how bulky substituents near the carboxylate cause steric hindrance, interfering with metal coordination. It is supported by the data point 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yielding low. While coverage is limited, the rule effectively explains the observed outcome and emphasizes the significance of steric factors.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and provides good property insight by explaining that long flexible chains with multiple ether linkages reduce effective coordination due to increased entropy and steric hindrance. It is supported by data points like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, both resulting in low yield. This demonstrates satisfactory coverage and supports the rule's validity.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and offers property insight by indicating that multiple fluorine atoms reduce the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination. However, the rule's coverage is limited to a single data point (nonafluoropentanoic acid), which diminishes the strength of the rule due to insufficient supporting data.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and provides adequate property insight by highlighting that aldehyde groups at the para position can hinder metal coordination due to potential side reactions or altered electronic distribution. It is supported by data points like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, both yielding low. This demonstrates acceptable coverage and reinforces the rule's validity.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is somewhat clear and gives property insight by suggesting that thiol groups near the carboxylate enhance metal coordination through strong binding. It is supported by the data point 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid yielding high. However, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid yields low, indicating that the rule may need refinement to specify that the thiol group must be on an aliphatic chain and in close proximity to the carboxylate for effective coordination. Coverage is limited, so the rule's general applicability may be constrained.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides property insight by explaining that para-amino groups on aromatic carboxylic acids enhance metal binding through additional coordination sites. It is supported by the data point 4-aminobenzoic acid yielding high. However, coverage is restricted to this single example, so further data would strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear and offers adequate property insight into how functional groups capable of forming chelate rings, like ketone or lactone groups adjacent to the carboxylate, increase complex stability and catalytic efficiency. It is supported by data points like 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid and possibly 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, both yielding high. This provides moderate coverage and supports the rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and provides property insight by suggesting that extended conjugation with ketone or ether linkages near the carboxylate facilitates electron delocalization, strengthening metal-ligand interactions. It is supported by the data point 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid yielding high. However, the rule's coverage is limited to this single example, requiring more data for stronger validation.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with an amino group (primary or secondary amine) located on the alpha or beta carbon** result in a **high yield**. The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylate allows for **chelation** with the metal center, enhancing catalyst efficiency. Examples include:
   - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) – amino group at the α-position.
   - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) – amino group at the α-position.
   - **5-aminopentanoic acid** – amino group within close proximity to the carboxylate.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro** or **halomethyl** groups, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination through stronger ionic interactions. Examples include:
   - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – nitro group at the para position.
   - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** – bromomethyl group at the para position.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating to metals** result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms provide additional coordination sites, strengthening the interaction with the metal center. Examples include:
   - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) – pyridine nitrogen coordinates with metal.
   - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** – pyrazole ring contains coordinating nitrogen atoms.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups in close proximity to the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance metal binding through **chelation** and increase catalyst stability. Examples include:
   - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) – several hydroxyl groups adjacent to carboxylate.
   - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** – multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with unfunctionalized long hydrophobic chains (six or more carbons)** result in a **high yield**. The lack of steric hindrance near the carboxylate allows effective metal coordination, and hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate-catalyst interactions. Example:
   - **Octanoic acid** – eight-carbon saturated fatty acid.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **amino or hydroxyl groups located more than three carbons away from the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating with the metal center due to reduced orbital overlap and increased conformational freedom. Examples include:
   - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** – amino group four carbons away from carboxylate.
   - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – amino group five carbons away.
   - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – hydroxyl group four carbons away.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl** or **hydroxyl** groups, result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease carboxylate acidity, weakening metal coordination due to reduced ionic character. Examples include:
   - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – methyl group at the para position.
   - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** – para-hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents causing steric hindrance near the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Steric bulk interferes with effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center. Example:
   - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – directly connected aromatic rings create steric hindrance.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **long flexible chains with multiple ether linkages**, such as **polyether carboxylic acids**, result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and size of ether chains reduce effective coordination due to increased entropy and steric factors. Examples include:
   - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** – triethylene glycol chain with terminal carboxylate.
   - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** – ether linkages separate amino and carboxylate groups.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **multiple fluorine atoms attached to the carbon chain** result in a **low yield**. Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination due to decreased basicity. Example:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** – heavily fluorinated pentanoic acid.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the para position** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or alter electronic distribution, hindering metal coordination. Examples include:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** – formyl group at the para position.
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** – formyl group near carboxylate.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with thiol groups located close to the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups coordinate strongly with metals, forming stable complexes that enhance catalytic activity. Example:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** – thiol group near the carboxylate allows chelation.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position** result in a **high yield**. The amino group provides an additional coordination site, strengthening metal binding through chelation. Example:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** – amino group at the para position enhances coordination.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **functional groups capable of forming chelate rings**, such as **ketone or lactone groups adjacent to the carboxylate**, result in a **high yield**. Chelation increases complex stability and catalytic efficiency. Example:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** – lactone ring adjacent to the carboxylate.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that have **extended conjugation with ketone or ether linkages near the carboxylate**, allowing for resonance stabilization and enhanced coordination, result in a **high yield**. These structures facilitate electron delocalization, strengthening metal-ligand interactions. Example:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** – conjugated system with methoxy groups.

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules consider the ability of functional groups to coordinate with the metal center, electronic effects of substituents on acidity and basicity, the impact of steric hindrance, and the formation of stable chelate complexes. By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural features.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Modify the SMARTS patterns in Rule 2 to enforce para substitution of electron-withdrawing groups relative to the carboxylate group.** Currently, the patterns do not specify the position of the substituents on the aromatic ring, leading to possible matches with meta or ortho substitutions. You can specify para substitution in SMARTS by numbering the ring atoms and ensuring substituents are on the correct positions. For example:

  ```python
  rule2_patterns = [
      # Para nitrobenzoic acid
      'c1cc(ccc1[NX3](=O)=O)[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]',
      # Para halomethylbenzoic acid
      'c1cc(ccc1[CH2][F,Cl,Br,I])[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]'
  ]
  ```

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Update the SMARTS patterns in Rule 3 to specify the position of the carboxylic acid relative to the nitrogen atoms in heterocycles.** The current patterns may match carboxylic acids at any position on the ring. To accurately reflect the examples, specify the positions:

  ```python
  rule3_patterns = [
      # Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid)
      'n1cc(C(=O)[OX1-,OX2H1])ccc1',
      # Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
      '[nH]1cc(C(=O)[OX1-,OX2H1])ncc1'
  ]
  ```

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Adjust the SMARTS patterns in Rule 7 to ensure electron-donating groups are at the para position relative to the carboxylate group.** This prevents incorrect matches with substitutions at other positions:

  ```python
  rule7_patterns = [
      # Para methyl or hydroxyl group
      'c1cc(ccc1[CH3,OX2H])[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]'
  ]
  ```

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Revise the SMARTS patterns in Rule 6 to match amino or hydroxyl groups located more than three carbons away from the carboxylate group, accommodating longer carbon chains.** Currently, only chains with four carbons are matched. Use recursive SMARTS or variable length patterns:

  ```python
  rule6_patterns = [
      # Amino group more than three carbons away
      '[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1][CH2]{3,}[CH2,NX3H2,NX3H1]',
      # Hydroxyl group more than three carbons away
      '[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1][CH2]{3,}[CH2,OX2H1]'
  ]
  ```

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Modify the SMARTS pattern in Rule 10 to match modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms on the carbon chain without requiring a specific sequence.** This captures any heavily fluorinated carbon chains:

  ```python
  rule10_patterns = [
      '[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1][C;$(C(F)(F)[F]),$(C(F)(F)[C,F])][C,F]*'
  ]
  ```

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Enhance the SMARTS patterns across all rules to accurately represent positional relationships and structural variations described in the natural language rules.** Consider using atom mapping and ring indexing where necessary to specify positions, and include additional patterns to cover structural diversity.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Standardize Functional Group Terminology Using SMARTS Patterns**  
  To facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix from SMILES strings, define all functional groups and structural features in the rules using SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification) patterns. SMARTS allows for precise specification of molecular substructures, which can be programmatically identified in SMILES strings. For example, instead of describing "carboxylic acids with an amino group at the alpha or beta carbon," use a SMARTS pattern like `[NX3;H2,H1;+0][CX4][CX3](=O)[O-]` to represent this motif.

- **Advice 2**: **Quantify Relative Positions of Functional Groups**  
  Replace qualitative descriptions of functional group positions (e.g., "close proximity," "more than three carbons away") with quantitative numerical descriptors. For instance, use the shortest path length between functional groups in the molecular graph. This can be calculated as the number of bonds separating two atoms or functional groups in the SMILES string, enabling precise feature extraction.

- **Advice 3**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules into Generalizable Categories**  
  Identify and merge overlapping or similar rules to reduce redundancy and improve clarity. For example, rules concerning electron-withdrawing groups (Rules 2 and 10) can be combined into a single rule about the impact of electron-withdrawing substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids. This consolidation aids in creating broader features that are easier to encode numerically.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Physicochemical Properties as Numeric Features**  
  Use quantitative physicochemical properties (e.g., pKa values, electron density, steric hindrance parameters) associated with functional groups and substituents. These properties can be calculated or obtained from databases and directly used as numeric features in the model. For example, electron-withdrawing or -donating effects can be quantified using Hammett sigma constants.

- **Advice 5**: **Define Steric Bulk Using Quantitative Measures**  
  Replace terms like "bulky substituents" with measurable steric parameters such as molar volume or topological polar surface area (TPSA). These values can be calculated from the molecular structure and used as numeric features to assess steric effects on yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Develop a Feature Matrix with Binary Indicators for Functional Groups**  
  Create a binary feature matrix where each column represents the presence (1) or absence (0) of specific functional groups or structural motifs identified in the rules. This approach allows for straightforward incorporation into machine learning models and statistical analysis to predict yields.

- **Advice 7**: **Use Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints**  
  Employ molecular descriptors (e.g., LogP, molecular weight) and fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) that capture structural information in a numeric format. These descriptors can be correlated with the reaction yield and assist in refining the rules based on quantitative data.

- **Advice 8**: **Integrate Machine Learning Techniques to Refine Rules**  
  Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze the existing dataset and identify patterns or features that correlate strongly with the yield outcome. This data-driven approach can uncover new insights and help in updating or creating rules that are more predictive and quantifiable.

- **Advice 9**: **Annotate the Dataset with Extracted Features for Validation**  
  Apply the revised rules to the dataset to extract the defined features and annotate each entry accordingly. This annotated dataset can then be used to validate the effectiveness of the rules in predicting high or low yields, and further adjustments can be made based on the results.

- **Advice 10**: **Provide Clear Guidelines for Rule Application**  
  Offer detailed instructions or algorithms on how to apply each rule to a SMILES string. This may include specifying the order of rule application, handling exceptions, and dealing with molecules that match multiple rules. Clear guidelines ensure consistent feature extraction and improve the reliability of the model.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or thiol group on the alpha carbon** result in a **high yield**. The proximal amino or thiol group can effectively chelate the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Examples include:
   - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) – amino group at the α-position.
   - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) – amino group at the α-position.
   - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** – thiol group at the α-position.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro**, **halomethyl**, or **amino** groups, result in a **high yield**. These groups increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – nitro group at the para position.
   - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** – bromomethyl group at the para position.
   - **4-aminobenzoic acid** – amino group at the para position.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metals** result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms provide additional coordination sites, strengthening metal-ligand interactions. Examples include:
   - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) – pyridine nitrogen coordinates with metal.
   - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** – pyrazole ring contains coordinating nitrogen atoms.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long unbranched hydrocarbon chains (five or more carbons)** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate-catalyst interactions without hindering metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **Octanoic acid** – eight-carbon saturated fatty acid.
   - **5-aminopentanoic acid** – five-carbon chain with an amino group.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. Hydroxyl groups can chelate the metal center, increasing catalyst stability. Examples include:
   - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) – several hydroxyl groups near carboxylate.
   - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** – ketone and hydroxyl functionalities adjacent to carboxylate.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl**, **methoxy**, or **hydroxyl** groups, result in a **low yield**. These groups decrease carboxylate acidity, weakening metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – methyl group at the para position.
   - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** – para-hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **flexible chains containing multiple ether linkages**, such as **polyether carboxylic acids**, result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and size of ether chains reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors. Example:
   - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** – triethylene glycol chain with terminal carboxylate.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **multiple fluorine atoms on the carbon chain** result in a **low yield**. Fluorine's strong electronegativity lowers the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination. Example:
   - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** – heavily fluorinated pentanoic acid.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **amino or hydroxyl groups located three or more carbons away from the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating with the metal center. Examples include:
   - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** – amino group four carbons away from carboxylate.
   - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – amino group five carbons away.
   - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – hydroxyl group four carbons away.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the para position** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or alter electronic distribution, hindering metal coordination. Examples include:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** – formyl group at the para position.
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** – formyl group near carboxylate.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance interferes with effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center. Example:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – directly connected aromatic rings create steric hindrance.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Without effective chelation sites, metal coordination is weaker. Example:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine) – lacks functional groups for chelation.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **thiol groups on an aromatic ring adjacent to the carboxylate** result in a **low yield**. Aromatic thiol groups may not coordinate effectively due to delocalization of electron density. Example:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** – thiol group on aromatic ring near carboxylate.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that have **amide or acetamido groups distant from the carboxylate** result in a **low yield**. The separation reduces the likelihood of chelation with the metal center. Example:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** – acetamido group distant from carboxylate.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with extended conjugation and ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. Ketone groups can participate in chelation, and conjugation stabilizes the coordination complex. Example:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** – ketone and lactone groups adjacent to carboxylate.

The rule involves complex sub-structures by considering multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points like **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, which provides adequate coverage.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear, indicating that electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids result in low yield. The property insight correctly links decreased carboxylate acidity to weakened metal coordination. The rule combines multiple structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. Data points such as **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** support the rule, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** specifies that modifiers with flexible chains containing multiple ether linkages yield low results.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** states that bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylate lead to low yield due to steric hindrance. The rule is clear, and the property insight is sound. It considers complex sub-structures, satisfying the complexity criterion. However, only **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** supports the rule, which may not provide sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** indicates that amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yield. While the rule is clear, its validity is questionable because **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) yields high, contradicting the rule. This inconsistency suggests that the rule lacks adequate coverage and may need refinement.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** clearly states that thiol groups on an aromatic ring adjacent to the carboxylate result in low yield. The property insight is plausible. The rule considers complex sub-structures, meeting the complexity criterion. However, only one data point, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, supports the rule, which may not be enough for solid coverage.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** specifies that distant amide or acetamido groups lead to low yield due to reduced chelation likelihood. The rule is clear, and the property insight is acceptable. It considers combinations of structural features, satisfying complexity. With only one supporting data point, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, coverage may be insufficient.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** states that aromatic carboxylic acids with extended conjugation and adjacent ketone groups yield high results. The rule is clear, and the property insight about enhanced chelation is reasonable. It involves complex sub-structures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. Only **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** supports the rule, suggesting limited coverage.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Merge Similar Rules to Reduce Redundancy**. Combine rules that address the same underlying principle to simplify the rule set and enhance clarity. For example, merge **Rule 1** and **Rule 12** since both discuss modifiers where amino acids with coordinating groups near the carboxylate result in high yield. This consolidation will reduce repetition and make the rules more streamlined.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rules with Contradictory Data Points**. Reevaluate rules that conflict with the dataset to improve accuracy. Specifically, adjust **Rule 8** (Modifiers that are alpha-amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in a low yield) to account for exceptions like **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), which yields high. Modify the rule to specify that aromatic side chains capable of additional coordination (e.g., indole or other heterocycles) can lead to high yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Increase Coverage by Adding Supporting Data**. For rules with limited supporting examples, gather additional data to strengthen their validity. Rules like **Rule 10** (Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms result in a low yield) and **Rule 15** (Modifiers with extended conjugation and ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylate result in a high yield) have limited data points. Seek out or generate more examples that fit these rules to enhance their robustness.

- **Advice 4**: **Clarify Exceptions and Specify Conditions**. In rules where exceptions exist, clearly state the specific conditions. For instance, in **Rule 7**, clarify that electron-donating groups must be directly attached to the aromatic ring bearing the carboxylate to significantly decrease yield. This adjustment accounts for modifiers like **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**, which yields high due to the hydroxyl group being separated by an aliphatic linker.

- **Advice 5**: **Detail Functional Group Positioning for Effective Coordination**. Emphasize the importance of proximity between coordinating groups and the carboxylate. In rules like **Rule 6** and **Rule 9**, specify that amino or hydroxyl groups need to be within three carbons of the carboxylate for effective metal coordination. This precision will improve the predictive accuracy of the rules.

- **Advice 6**: **Address Steric Hindrance in Bulky Substituents**. Refine **Rule 11** to account for steric hindrance caused by bulky substituents near the coordination site. Provide additional examples or merge it with **Rule 8**, which also discusses steric effects impacting metal coordination. This will consolidate related concepts and strengthen the rule.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Electronic Effects in Aromatic Systems**. Enhance rules concerning aromatic carboxylic acids by thoroughly considering electronic effects. For example, in **Rule 2**, include all strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., cyano groups) that increase carboxylate acidity. Similarly, ensure **Rule 6** covers all electron-donating groups that can decrease yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**. Review rules with complex structural descriptions, such as **Rule 14** and **Rule 15**, and simplify their language for better comprehension. For instance, rephrase **Rule 15** to focus on modifiers with adjacent ketone or lactone groups that enhance coordination through chelation, using clearer terminology.

- **Advice 9**: **Remove or Modify Under-Supported Rules**. Consider removing rules that are supported by only one data point and lack sufficient property insight. If these rules are important, modify them to merge with other rules or expand them to include more examples. This applies to rules like **Rule 13** (Modifiers with thiol groups on an aromatic ring result in low yield).

- **Advice 10**: **Enhance Property Insights with Mechanistic Explanations**. Provide deeper mechanistic explanations for why certain modifiers lead to high or low yields. For example, explain how electron-withdrawing groups stabilize negative charges on the carboxylate, enhancing metal binding, or how specific functional groups interfere with the coordination sphere of the metal catalyst.

- **Advice 11**: **Validate Rules Against the Entire Dataset**. Cross-check each rule thoroughly against all data points to ensure consistency and accuracy. Adjust rules as necessary when data points do not align with the rule's predictions. This comprehensive validation will strengthen the reliability of the rule set.

- **Advice 12**: **Emphasize the Role of Chelation**. Highlight the importance of chelating abilities in modifiers throughout the rules. For modifiers that result in high yield due to chelation (e.g., those with proximal amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups), stress how chelation enhances catalyst stability and activity.

- **Advice 13**: **Consider Steric and Electronic Effects Together**. In rules where both steric hindrance and electronic factors influence yield, such as modifiers with bulky electron-donating groups, combine these considerations into a single rule. This holistic approach can provide a more accurate prediction of modifier effectiveness.

- **Advice 14**: **Update Rules with New Substituents and Functional Groups**. Expand existing rules to include additional substituents and functional groups encountered in new modifiers. This will keep the rules current and improve their applicability to a broader range of compounds.

- **Advice 15**: **Structure Rules Hierarchically for Clarity**. Organize the rules in a hierarchical manner, grouping them by overarching principles (e.g., electronic effects, steric effects, chelation) to improve readability and ease of use. This structure will help users quickly identify relevant rules based on the specific characteristics of a modifier.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or thiol group on the alpha carbon** result in a **high yield**. The proximal amino or thiol group can effectively chelate the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Examples include:
   - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) – amino group at the α-position.
   - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) – amino group at the α-position.
   - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** – thiol group at the α-position.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro**, **halomethyl**, or **amino** groups, result in a **high yield**. These groups increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – nitro group at the para position.
   - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** – bromomethyl group at the para position.
   - **4-aminobenzoic acid** – amino group at the para position.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metals** result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms provide additional coordination sites, strengthening metal-ligand interactions. Examples include:
   - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) – pyridine nitrogen coordinates with metal.
   - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** – pyrazole ring contains coordinating nitrogen atoms.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long unbranched hydrocarbon chains (five or more carbons)** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate-catalyst interactions without hindering metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **Octanoic acid** – eight-carbon saturated fatty acid.
   - **5-aminopentanoic acid** – five-carbon chain with an amino group.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. Hydroxyl groups can chelate the metal center, increasing catalyst stability. Examples include:
   - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) – several hydroxyl groups near carboxylate.
   - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** – ketone and hydroxyl functionalities adjacent to carboxylate.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl**, **methoxy**, or **hydroxyl** groups, result in a **low yield**. These groups decrease carboxylate acidity, weakening metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – methyl group at the para position.
   - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** – para-hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **flexible chains containing multiple ether linkages**, such as **polyether carboxylic acids**, result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and size of ether chains reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors. Example:
   - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** – triethylene glycol chain with terminal carboxylate.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **multiple fluorine atoms on the carbon chain** result in a **low yield**. Fluorine's strong electronegativity lowers the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination. Example:
   - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** – heavily fluorinated pentanoic acid.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **amino or hydroxyl groups located three or more carbons away from the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating with the metal center. Examples include:
   - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** – amino group four carbons away from carboxylate.
   - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – amino group five carbons away.
   - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – hydroxyl group four carbons away.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the para position** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or alter electronic distribution, hindering metal coordination. Examples include:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** – formyl group at the para position.
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** – formyl group near carboxylate.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance interferes with effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center. Example:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – directly connected aromatic rings create steric hindrance.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Without effective chelation sites, metal coordination is weaker. Example:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine) – lacks functional groups for chelation.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **thiol groups on an aromatic ring adjacent to the carboxylate** result in a **low yield**. Aromatic thiol groups may not coordinate effectively due to delocalization of electron density. Example:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** – thiol group on aromatic ring near carboxylate.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that have **amide or acetamido groups distant from the carboxylate** result in a **low yield**. The separation reduces the likelihood of chelation with the metal center. Example:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** – acetamido group distant from carboxylate.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with extended conjugation and ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. Ketone groups can participate in chelation, and conjugation stabilizes the coordination complex. Example:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** – ketone and lactone groups adjacent to carboxylate.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise the SMARTS patterns for Rule 1 to be more specific.** The current code for Rule 1 uses the pattern `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`, which matches any carboxylic acid group. This is too general and will cause Rule 1 to match any molecule containing a carboxylic acid, regardless of whether there is an amino or thiol group on the alpha carbon. The SMARTS patterns should be modified to ensure that they specifically match aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or thiol group on the alpha carbon.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Update Rule 1 SMARTS patterns to accurately represent the alpha-substituted amino or thiol groups.** A more precise pattern for Rule 1 could be:
  - `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4H]([NX3H2,SX2H])[CX4H2]'`
  This pattern represents a carboxylic acid connected to a carbon (alpha carbon) that has an amino or thiol group attached.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns for Rule 2 to target electron-withdrawing groups at the para position.** The current pattern for Rule 2 includes `'[c][c](C(=O)[O,H])[c][c][c][c]'`, which matches any aromatic carboxylic acid. This is too broad. The patterns should be adjusted to specifically match aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro, halomethyl, or amino groups) at the para position relative to the carboxylate group. For example:
  - `'c1ccc(cc1C(=O)[O,H])[*]'` where `[*]` is replaced with specific electron-withdrawing groups at the para position.

- **Suggestion 4**: **For Rule 2, create separate SMARTS patterns for each electron-withdrawing group.** This increases specificity. For example:
  - Nitro group at para position: `'c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1C(=O)[O,H]'`
  - Halomethyl group at para position: `'c1cc(CBr)ccc1C(=O)[O,H]'`
  - Amino group at para position: `'c1cc(N)ccc1C(=O)[O,H]'`

- **Suggestion 5**: **Ensure that Rule 3 patterns match heterocyclic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms.** The current patterns may not capture all such structures. Update the SMARTS patterns to:
  - Include heterocycles with nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination, such as pyridine or pyrazole rings attached to a carboxylic acid group.
  - Example pattern for nicotinic acid: `'n1cccc1C(=O)[O,H]'`
  - Example pattern for pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid: `'c1cn[nH]c1C(=O)[O,H]'`

- **Suggestion 6**: **Modify the patterns for Rule 4 to accurately capture aliphatic carboxylic acids with long unbranched hydrocarbon chains.** The current patterns might be too specific or miss certain valid structures. A better pattern could be:
  - `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2]'` which ensures at least a five-carbon chain.
  - Include a pattern for amino groups at the end of the chain: `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4H2]{4,}[NX3H2]'`

- **Suggestion 7**: **Adjust Rule 5 patterns to detect multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate accurately.** The current patterns may not capture all molecules fitting this rule. Use patterns like:
  - `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])'` for three hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate.
  - Consider using recursive SMARTS to allow for varying numbers of hydroxyl groups.

- **Suggestion 8**: **For Rule 6, ensure patterns specifically match electron-donating groups at the para position on aromatic carboxylic acids.** Refine the patterns to:
  - Methyl group at para position: `'c1cc(C)ccc1C(=O)[O,H]'`
  - Methoxy group at para position: `'c1cc(OC)ccc1C(=O)[O,H]'`
  - Hydroxyl group at para position: `'c1cc(O)ccc1C(=O)[O,H]'`

- **Suggestion 9**: **Re-evaluate the patterns for Rules 7 to 15 to ensure they are accurate and specific.** For example:
  - **Rule 7**: Match flexible chains with multiple ether linkages using patterns like `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4H2]([OX2][CX4H2]){2,}[OX2][CX4H2]'`.
  - **Rule 9**: Identify amino or hydroxyl groups located three or more atoms away from the carboxylate group with patterns such as `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4H2]{3,}[NX3H2,OX2H]'`.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Test each SMARTS pattern individually using known compounds.** Validate that the patterns match molecules that should fit the rule and do not match those that shouldn't. This helps to ensure the patterns are correctly implemented.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Remove overly general patterns that cause unintended matches.** Patterns that match very common functional groups (like any carboxylic acid) should be combined with additional structural requirements to increase specificity.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Consider using molecular descriptors or cheminformatics software to aid in pattern development.** Tools like RDKit can help visualize the substructures matched by SMARTS patterns, making it easier to refine them accurately.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance**

Upon examining the current rules and their associated metrics, we can observe several trends when compared to the previous reference metrics. Focusing on **confidence** and **lift**, the key findings are as follows:

1. **Confidence**

   - **Previous Train Confidence**: 63.52% and 53.96%
   - **Current Train Confidences**:
     - Rule 1: 74.44%
     - Rule 2: 70.31%
     - Rule 3: 72.38%
     - Rule 4: 46.19%
     - **Overall Current Train Confidence**: 59.68%

   The first three current rules demonstrate higher confidence levels than the previous iterations, indicating that a higher proportion of records meeting the rule conditions result in the predicted outcome (high yield). This suggests that these rules are more reliable in predicting the desired outcome.

   However, Rule 4 has a significantly lower confidence of 46.19%, which is below both previous confidence metrics. This lower confidence indicates that this rule is less dependable, and a considerable portion of records meeting its conditions do not result in a high yield.

2. **Lift**

   - **Previous Train Lift**: 1.2048 and 1.0559
   - **Current Train Lifts**:
     - Rule 1: 1.4997
     - Rule 2: 1.4033
     - Rule 3: 1.4661
     - Rule 4: 0.9120
     - **Overall Current Train Lift**: 1.2005

   The lift values for the first three current rules are substantially higher than the previous metrics, indicating that these rules are more effective at identifying true associations beyond what would be expected by chance. A lift greater than 1 signifies that the presence of the rule conditions increases the probability of the predicted outcome.

   In contrast, Rule 4 has a lift less than 1 (0.9120), suggesting that the rule conditions are associated with a decrease in the likelihood of achieving a high yield. This implies that Rule 4 may not be beneficial and could potentially mislead the prediction process.

3. **Support**

   - **Previous Train Supports**: 16.67% and 18.45%
   - **Current Train Supports**:
     - Rule 1: 4.76%
     - Rule 2: 3.57%
     - Rule 3: 8.19%
     - Rule 4: 13.57%
     - **Overall Current Train Support**: 6.48%

   The current rules have lower support values compared to the previous metrics, indicating they cover a smaller portion of the dataset. While high confidence and lift are desirable, the low support suggests that these rules may not be applicable to a large number of cases, potentially limiting their practical utility.

4. **Leverage**

   - **Previous Train Leverages**: 0.0289 and -0.0041
   - **Current Train Leverages**:
     - Rule 1: 0.0163
     - Rule 2: 0.0065
     - Rule 3: 0.0128
     - Rule 4: -0.0039
     - **Overall Current Train Leverage**: 0.0021

   Positive leverage values for Rules 1 to 3 indicate a stronger association than would be expected by chance, reinforcing their potential usefulness. The negative leverage for Rule 4 aligns with its lift being less than 1, further suggesting that it may not contribute positively to the predictive model.

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

Considering the mixed performance of the current rules, it appears that the model has not yet reached a local minimum:

- **Strengths**:
  - **Higher Confidence and Lift**: The improved confidence and lift values for the first three rules indicate progress in identifying strong associations.
  - **Positive Leverage**: The positive leverage for these rules supports their validity.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - **Low Support**: The reduced support suggests that the rules are too narrow, capturing only a small subset of the data.
  - **Underperforming Rule**: Rule 4's poor metrics negatively impact the overall performance, indicating a need for refinement.

Given these factors, additional iterations could help balance the trade-offs between confidence, lift, and support, striving to develop rules that are both accurate and widely applicable.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Enhance Rule Coverage (Increase Support)**

   - **Generalize Rule Conditions**: Review the specificity of the rule conditions. Broadening criteria slightly could increase support while maintaining acceptable confidence and lift levels.
   - **Incorporate Additional Relevant Features**: Identify other features or descriptors that are common among high-yield cases to expand rule applicability.

2. **Refine Underperforming Rules**

   - **Reevaluate Rule 4**: Given its low confidence and lift, consider modifying or removing this rule. Investigate whether altering its conditions could improve performance (e.g., adjusting the chain length or considering branching in aliphatic chains).
   - **Analyze Negative Impact**: Determine if any other rules similarly detract from overall performance and address them accordingly.

3. **Balance Specificity and Generality**

   - **Avoid Overfitting**: Extremely specific rules may capture noise rather than meaningful patterns. Strive for rules that are general enough to apply to unseen data but specific enough to maintain predictive power.
   - **Use Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques to assess how well the rules generalize to new data, helping to prevent overfitting.

4. **Combine Similar Rules**

   - **Merge Overlapping Rules**: Identify rules with overlapping conditions or outcomes and consider combining them to improve support without sacrificing confidence.
   - **Hierarchical Rule Structuring**: Organize rules hierarchically, with broader rules at higher levels and more specific ones nested underneath, to capture patterns at different granularities.

5. **Leverage Domain Expertise**

   - **Consult Chemical Principles**: Use knowledge of chemical behavior to inform rule adjustments. For example, consider the effects of sterics, electronics, and chelation on catalyst performance.
   - **Functional Group Effects**: Analyze how different functional groups influence yield and adjust rules to accurately reflect these relationships.

6. **Iterative Refinement**

   - **Monitor Metrics Over Iterations**: Keep track of how metrics change with each iteration to identify trends and diminishing returns.
   - **Set Convergence Criteria**: Define thresholds for metrics to determine when sufficient optimization has been achieved (e.g., minimum confidence and support levels).

7. **Incorporate Test Data Evaluation**

   - **Validate with Test Data**: Ensure that improvements in training metrics translate to test data. A rule performing well on training data but poorly on test data may not generalize effectively.
   - **Adjust Rules Based on Test Performance**: Use insights from test data to refine rules, focusing on those that consistently perform well across datasets.

8. **Explore New Rule Generation Techniques**

   - **Algorithmic Rule Discovery**: Utilize machine learning algorithms capable of generating and evaluating a large number of potential rules, such as association rule mining or decision tree algorithms.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create new features by combining or transforming existing ones, potentially revealing stronger associations.

**Conclusion**

While the current rules show promise, particularly with higher confidence and lift in some areas, there is clear room for improvement. The goal should be to develop rules that not only predict high yields accurately (high confidence and lift) but also apply to a significant portion of the dataset (higher support). 

By focusing on increasing support through generalization, refining or removing underperforming rules, and leveraging domain knowledge, the performance of the rules can be enhanced. 

Additional iterations are warranted, with careful monitoring of how changes affect all metrics. Balancing the interplay between support, confidence, and lift will be crucial in avoiding overfitting and ensuring that the rules are both reliable and broadly applicable.

**Next Steps**

- **Implement the Recommended Adjustments**: Begin refining the rules based on the suggestions provided.
- **Re-Evaluate Metrics After Adjustments**: After making changes, recalculate the metrics to assess improvements.
- **Determine if a Local Minimum Has Been Reached**: If subsequent iterations yield minimal metric improvements, it may indicate that a local minimum has been approached.
- **Document Changes and Rationale**: Keep detailed records of rule modifications and the reasoning behind them to inform future iterations and potential collaborations.

By systematically applying these recommendations, the rules can be optimized to better serve the goals of the research program and enhance the predictive modeling of catalytic performance.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules**

   The current iteration shows a significant decline in predictive performance compared to previous iterations. Earlier validation accuracies were consistently high, around **0.76**, with test accuracies of **0.75** and **0.625**. In contrast, the latest 5-fold validation accuracy has dropped to **0.5143**. This notable decrease suggests that the current set of rules is **not effective enough** in capturing the key features that determine the loading of modifiers on the catalyst.

2. **Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

   The consistent high accuracies in previous iterations followed by a sharp decline indicate potential issues with **underfitting**. The current rules may be too generalized or lack the specificity needed to model the complex relationships in the dataset. This underfitting results in the model failing to capture important variations in the data, leading to poorer performance on both training and validation sets.

3. **Analysis of Discrepancies via SHAP Values**

   The SHAP analysis provides insights into how each rule influences the model's predictions. By examining instances where the model's predictions do not align with experimental values, we can identify problematic rules.

   - **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

     - **Molecule: C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**

       - Predicted: High loading
       - Experimental: Low loading
       - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
         - **Rule 2**: SHAP value of **0.0634**
         - **Rule 8**: SHAP value of **0.0230**
         - **Rule 11**: SHAP value of **0.0102**

     - **Molecule: C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN**

       - Predicted: High loading
       - Experimental: Low loading
       - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
         - **Rule 2**: SHAP value of **0.0634**
         - **Rule 8**: SHAP value of **0.0230**
         - **Rule 11**: SHAP value of **0.0102**

   - **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

     - **Molecule: C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**

       - Predicted: Low loading
       - Experimental: High loading
       - **Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
         - **Rule 2**: SHAP value of **-0.1924**
         - **Rule 3**: SHAP value of **-0.0118**

     - **Molecule: C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N**

       - Predicted: Low loading
       - Experimental: High loading
       - **Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
         - **Rule 2**: SHAP value of **-0.1924**
         - **Rule 3**: SHAP value of **-0.0118**

   The discrepancies highlight that **Rule 2** is contributing significantly to incorrect predictions—both overestimations and underestimations—depending on the molecule.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Decline**

   The decline in accuracy from **0.76** to **0.5143** suggests that modifications made to the rules in the current iteration have negatively impacted the model's predictive ability. This decline may indicate that the rules are either too broad, causing misclassifications, or too narrow, failing to capture essential features across different molecules.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis**

   The SHAP analysis points toward specific rules that disproportionately influence the model's incorrect predictions:

   - **Rule 2**: Shows both high positive and negative SHAP values in cases of misclassification, indicating inconsistency in its application.
   - **Rule 8** and **Rule 11**: Contribute to overestimations when the experimental value is low.
   - **Rule 3**: Contributes to underestimations when the experimental value is high.

   These insights suggest that certain rules may be too generalized or not accurately capturing the nuances of molecular interactions affecting catalyst loading.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule 2**

   - **Issue Identified**: **Rule 2** is intended to classify modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position as high yield, but it contributes to both overestimations and underestimations.
   - **Suggested Actions**:
     - **Narrow Down Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Specify which electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, cyano) consistently result in high yield and exclude others that may not have the same effect.
     - **Consider Position Effects**: Evaluate whether substituents at positions other than para (ortho, meta) influence the yield similarly.
     - **Incorporate Additional Functional Groups**: Examine the effect of other groups on the aromatic ring that may interact synergistically or antagonistically with electron-withdrawing groups.

2. **Adjust Rule 3**

   - **Issue Identified**: **Rule 3** assumes all heterocyclic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms result in high yield, but this is not consistently observed.
   - **Suggested Actions**:
     - **Specify Heterocycles**: Identify which heterocycles (e.g., pyridine vs. pyrrole) are effective and adjust the rule accordingly.
     - **Assess Nitrogen Position**: Consider the position of nitrogen atoms within the ring and their availability for coordination.
     - **Include Steric Factors**: Evaluate if bulky substituents on the heterocycle hinder coordination.

3. **Review Rule 8**

   - **Issue Identified**: **Rule 8** states that modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms result in low yield, but positive SHAP values indicate overestimations.
   - **Suggested Actions**:
     - **Differentiate Fluorination Patterns**: Distinguish between perfluoroalkyl chains and molecules where fluorine is adjacent to functional groups that enhance coordination.
     - **Consider Electron-Withdrawing Effects**: While fluorine is electron-withdrawing, in some contexts, this may increase acidity and improve metal coordination.
     - **Examine Counterexamples**: Identify molecules where fluorination does not lead to low yield and adjust the rule to accommodate these cases.

4. **Reevaluate Rule 11**

   - **Issue Identified**: **Rule 11** suggests that bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group result in low yield, but the rule sometimes contributes to overestimations.
   - **Suggested Actions**:
     - **Define Bulky Substituents**: Clearly specify what constitutes a bulky group (e.g., tert-butyl vs. methyl groups).
     - **Consider Spatial Arrangement**: Account for the three-dimensional orientation of substituents that may reduce steric hindrance despite bulkiness.
     - **Include Functional Group Interactions**: Evaluate whether the bulky groups participate in additional interactions that facilitate coordination.

5. **Improve Generalization**

   - **Issue Identified**: The current rules may be too simplistic or generalized, leading to underfitting.
   - **Suggested Actions**:
     - **Incorporate Quantitative Descriptors**: Use molecular descriptors such as electronic parameters (Hammett constants), steric parameters (Taft steric constants), and coordination modes.
     - **Implement Machine Learning Features**: Combine rule-based features with data-driven features extracted from molecular structures.
     - **Expand Rule Set**: Develop additional rules that capture more subtle effects, such as secondary coordination, hydrogen bonding, and π-interactions.

6. **Address Overfitting**

   - **Issue Identified**: The rules may inadvertently be tailored to specific molecules in the training set, limiting generalizability.
   - **Suggested Actions**:
     - **Cross-Validate Rules**: Test the rules on unseen data to ensure they generalize well beyond the training set.
     - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: Remove or modify rules that are too specific and do not contribute to improved accuracy on validation sets.

7. **Iterative Rule Refinement**

   - **Use SHAP Insights**: Continuously use SHAP analysis to identify and refine rules that contribute most to prediction errors.
   - **Set Thresholds for Rule Impact**: Prioritize adjustments to rules with the highest absolute SHAP values in incorrect predictions.
   - **Monitor Performance Metrics**: After each iteration of rule adjustments, evaluate the impact on validation accuracy to ensure improvements.

8. **Enhance the Dataset**

   - **Increase Diversity**: Incorporate more diverse molecules to capture a broader range of chemical behaviors.
   - **Balance the Dataset**: Ensure equal representation of high and low yield modifiers to prevent bias.

9. **Collaborate with Domain Experts**

   - **Chemical Intuition**: Consult with chemists to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules and their adjustments.
   - **Literature Review**: Stay updated with recent studies to incorporate new findings into the rule set.

---

**Conclusion**

The current decline in model performance highlights the need for careful refinement of the existing rules. By focusing on rules like **Rule 2**, **Rule 3**, **Rule 8**, and **Rule 11**, which are identified by SHAP analysis as contributing to mispredictions, we can adjust and improve their definitions to better capture the underlying chemistry. Incorporating more specific criteria, leveraging quantitative descriptors, and ensuring that the rules are both chemically sound and data-driven will enhance the model's accuracy and reliability.

**Next Steps**

- **Modify the Identified Rules**: Implement the suggested adjustments for the problematic rules.
- **Re-evaluate the Model**: Run the model with the updated rules and compare performance metrics.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Use SHAP analysis in each iteration to guide further refinements.

By adopting a systematic approach to rule refinement and leveraging insights from both data and chemical theory, we can improve the model's predictive power and contribute valuable knowledge to the research program.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has shown a decline in predictive performance compared to previous iterations. The latest 5-fold validation accuracy has dropped to **51.43%**, a significant decrease from previous accuracies around **76%**. This decline indicates that the current rules are not capturing the key molecular features influencing the catalytic activity effectively.

**Key Issues Identified:**

1. **Underperforming Rules:**
   - **Rule 2:** Intended to identify modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position leading to high yield, but SHAP analysis shows inconsistent contributions, causing both overestimations and underestimations.
   - **Rule 3:** Aimed at modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms, but does not consistently predict high yields.
   - **Rule 8:** Associates modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms with low yield, but contributes to overestimations in some cases.
   - **Rule 11:** Suggests that bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylate result in low yield, yet sometimes leads to overestimations.

2. **Low Support and Specificity:**
   - The rules have low support, covering a small portion of the dataset, limiting their practical utility.
   - Overgeneralization or oversimplification of rules leads to underfitting, failing to capture complex molecular interactions.

3. **Lack of Accurate SMARTS Patterns:**
   - Some SMARTS patterns are too general or incorrect, causing misclassification.
   - The patterns need refinement to increase specificity and accurately represent the chemical structures described in the rules.

**Directions and Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns:**

   - **Rule 1 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Alpha Amino or Thiol Groups):**
     - Update the SMARTS pattern to specifically match aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or thiol group on the alpha carbon.
     - Suggested SMARTS: `'[NX3H2,SX2H][CX4H]C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`

   - **Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups at Para Position):**
     - Create specific SMARTS patterns for each electron-withdrawing group.
     - Examples:
       - Nitro group: `'c1ccc(cc1)[NX3](=O)=O'`
       - Halomethyl group: `'c1ccc(cc1)CBr'`
       - Amino group: `'c1ccc(cc1)N'`
     - Ensure the electron-withdrawing group is at the para position relative to the carboxylate.

   - **Rule 3 (Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids with Coordinating Nitrogen Atoms):**
     - Specify heterocycles and positions where nitrogen atoms can coordinate.
     - Examples:
       - Pyridine carboxylic acids: `'n1cccc1C(=O)[O,H]'`
       - Pyrazole carboxylic acids: `'c1cn[nH]c1C(=O)[O,H]'`

   - **Rule 4 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Long Unbranched Hydrocarbon Chains):**
     - Adjust the pattern to capture chains of five or more carbons.
     - Suggested SMARTS: `'C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2]{4,}'`

   - **Rule 5 (Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylate):**
     - Use recursive SMARTS to account for varying numbers of hydroxyl groups.
     - Suggested SMARTS: `'C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH](O)[CH](O)[CH](O)'`

   - **Rule 6 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups at Para Position):**
     - Refine patterns to specifically match electron-donating groups.
     - Examples:
       - Methyl group: `'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)[O,H])C'`
       - Methoxy group: `'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)[O,H])OC'`
       - Hydroxyl group: `'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)[O,H])O'`

2. **Reevaluate and Adjust Underperforming Rules:**

   - **Rule 2:**
     - Narrow down the electron-withdrawing groups to those consistently resulting in high yield.
     - Consider the influence of substituents in other positions (ortho, meta).
     - Exclude groups that do not enhance yield despite being electron-withdrawing.

   - **Rule 3:**
     - Specify which heterocycles are effective.
     - Assess the positional availability of nitrogen atoms for coordination.
     - Incorporate steric factors that may hinder coordination.

   - **Rule 8:**
     - Differentiate between types of fluorination.
     - Consider the effect of fluorine on acidity and coordination behavior.
     - Adjust the rule to account for exceptions.

   - **Rule 11:**
     - Clearly define what constitutes a bulky substituent.
     - Account for stereochemistry and spatial orientation.
     - Evaluate the possibility of beneficial interactions despite bulkiness.

3. **Increase Rule Specificity Without Overfitting:**

   - **Balance Generality and Specificity:**
     - Ensure rules are not too broad to cause misclassifications.
     - Avoid overfitting by not making rules excessively narrow.

   - **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors:**
     - Use electronic parameters (e.g., Hammett constants) to quantify substituent effects.
     - Consider steric factors and coordination modes in rule definitions.

4. **Validate and Test Updated Rules:**

   - **Individual Rule Testing:**
     - Test each updated SMARTS pattern against known compounds.
     - Validate that the patterns correctly match intended molecules and exclude others.

   - **Cross-Validation:**
     - Use cross-validation techniques to assess the generalizability of the rules.
     - Ensure that improvements in training accuracy translate to validation and test sets.

5. **Leverage Computational Tools:**

   - **Use Cheminformatics Software:**
     - Utilize RDKit or similar tools to visualize and debug SMARTS patterns.
     - Employ molecular modeling to assess the potential coordination of modifiers.

   - **Iterative Refinement:**
     - Continually refine rules based on performance metrics and SHAP analysis.
     - Monitor changes in accuracy, support, confidence, and lift with each iteration.

6. **Consult Chemical Expertise:**

   - **Domain Knowledge Integration:**
     - Work with chemists to ensure rules are chemically sound.
     - Incorporate insights on coordination chemistry, steric effects, and electronic factors.

   - **Literature Review:**
     - Update rules based on recent findings and established chemical principles.
     - Identify patterns observed in successful catalysts from published studies.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is considerable potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The key is to refine the rules to be specific enough to capture the critical chemical features influencing catalyst performance while maintaining generality to apply across diverse molecules. By:

- **Adjusting SMARTS patterns for precision.**
- **Reevaluating and refining underperforming rules based on SHAP analysis insights.**
- **Balancing rule specificity to avoid underfitting and overfitting.**
- **Validating rules through rigorous testing and cross-validation.**

We can enhance the model's predictive power and reliability. The use of domain expertise and computational tools will support the development of robust, chemically meaningful rules.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or thiol group on the alpha carbon** result in a **high yield**. The proximal amino or thiol group can effectively chelate the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Examples include:
   - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) – amino group at the α-position.
   - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) – amino group at the α-position.
   - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** – thiol group at the α-position.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro**, **halomethyl**, or **amino** groups, result in a **high yield**. These groups increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – nitro group at the para position.
   - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** – bromomethyl group at the para position.
   - **4-aminobenzoic acid** – amino group at the para position.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metals** result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms provide additional coordination sites, strengthening metal-ligand interactions. Examples include:
   - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) – pyridine nitrogen coordinates with metal.
   - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** – pyrazole ring contains coordinating nitrogen atoms.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long unbranched hydrocarbon chains (five or more carbons)** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate-catalyst interactions without hindering metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **Octanoic acid** – eight-carbon saturated fatty acid.
   - **5-aminopentanoic acid** – five-carbon chain with an amino group.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. Hydroxyl groups can chelate the metal center, increasing catalyst stability. Examples include:
   - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) – several hydroxyl groups near carboxylate.
   - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** – ketone and hydroxyl functionalities adjacent to carboxylate.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl**, **methoxy**, or **hydroxyl** groups, result in a **low yield**. These groups decrease carboxylate acidity, weakening metal coordination. Examples include:
   - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – methyl group at the para position.
   - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** – para-hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **flexible chains containing multiple ether linkages**, such as **polyether carboxylic acids**, result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and size of ether chains reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors. Example:
   - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** – triethylene glycol chain with terminal carboxylate.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **multiple fluorine atoms on the carbon chain** result in a **low yield**. Fluorine's strong electronegativity lowers the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination. Example:
   - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** – heavily fluorinated pentanoic acid.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **amino or hydroxyl groups located three or more carbons away from the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating with the metal center. Examples include:
   - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** – amino group four carbons away from carboxylate.
   - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – amino group five carbons away.
   - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – hydroxyl group four carbons away.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the para position** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or alter electronic distribution, hindering metal coordination. Examples include:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** – formyl group at the para position.
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** – formyl group near carboxylate.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance interferes with effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center. Example:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – directly connected aromatic rings create steric hindrance.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Without effective chelation sites, metal coordination is weaker. Example:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine) – lacks functional groups for chelation.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **thiol groups on an aromatic ring adjacent to the carboxylate** result in a **low yield**. Aromatic thiol groups may not coordinate effectively due to delocalization of electron density. Example:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** – thiol group on aromatic ring near carboxylate.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that have **amide or acetamido groups distant from the carboxylate** result in a **low yield**. The separation reduces the likelihood of chelation with the metal center. Example:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** – acetamido group distant from carboxylate.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with extended conjugation and ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. Ketone groups can participate in chelation, and conjugation stabilizes the coordination complex. Example:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** – ketone and lactone groups adjacent to carboxylate.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  Rule 1 is clear and allows for the straightforward determination of high yield modifiers based on the structural feature of being alpha-amino acids with carboxylic acid side chains. The rule provides good physical-chemical insight by explaining that the proximity of amino and carboxylate groups enhances metal chelation. It considers combinations of sub-structures (alpha-amino acids with additional carboxylate groups) rather than a single functional group. The rule is supported by at least two data points—**(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**—which both result in high yield. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**:

  Rule 2 is clear, specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in a high yield. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining that electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring with para substituents) and is supported by data points such as **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, both yielding high results. The balance between rule complexity and data coverage is satisfactory.

- **Comment 3**:

  Rule 3 clearly identifies that heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms result in high yield due to additional coordination sites provided by nitrogen atoms. It offers sound physical-chemical insight. The rule combines heterocyclic structures with carboxylate groups, adding complexity. Supported by data points like **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, which both show high yield, the rule has acceptable coverage and balances complexity and coverage well.

- **Comment 4**:

  Rule 4 is clear in stating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxylate result in high yield. The physical-chemical insight is strong, highlighting the role of proximal functional groups in metal chelation. The rule considers combinations of functional groups. Data points such as **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** and **5-aminopentanoic acid** support the rule with high yields, ensuring good coverage and a balanced approach.

- **Comment 5**:

  Rule 5 provides clarity by specifying that long, unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids (six or more carbons) without interfering functional groups result in high yield. It offers insight suggesting that hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate-catalyst interactions. While it focuses on a single structural feature, the length of the carbon chain adds complexity. Supported by **octanoic acid** yielding a high result, the rule has limited coverage but maintains a reasonable balance between simplicity and effectiveness.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 is clear, indicating that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate lead to high yield. The rule provides physical-chemical insight into how multiple coordination points increase catalyst stability. It incorporates combinations of sub-structures (hydroxyl groups and carboxylates). **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** supports the rule with a high yield. Although coverage is limited, the rule's complexity is balanced.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position result in low yield. The rule offers adequate insight by explaining that electron-donating groups decrease carboxylate acidity and weaken metal coordination. It considers combinations of sub-structures. Supported by data points like **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, which yield low results, the rule has good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 8**:

  Rule 8 provides clarity by identifying that modifiers with functional groups located more than three carbons away from the carboxylate result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight is sufficient, noting the reduced effectiveness of distal functional groups in metal coordination. The rule involves spatial considerations of functional groups, adding complexity. Data points such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** support the rule, ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 9**:

  Rule 9 clearly states that extensively fluorinated modifiers result in low yield due to electron-withdrawing effects reducing carboxylate basicity. The physical-chemical insight is sound. While focusing on a specific feature (fluorination), the extensive nature adds complexity. **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** supports the rule with a low yield. Coverage is limited but acceptable given the specificity.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 is clear in indicating that modifiers with flexible polyether chains attached to the carboxylate result in low yield, citing entropic factors. The rule provides physical-chemical insight into how flexibility reduces effective coordination. It considers the combination of polyether chains with carboxylates. Supported by **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** yielding a low result, the rule has limited coverage but maintains an appropriate balance.

- **Comment 11**:

  Rule 11 clearly specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups at the ortho or para position result in low yield. It offers insight into potential side reactions and hindrance of metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, both showing low yields. Coverage and balance are satisfactory.

- **Comment 12**:

  Rule 12 clearly denotes that bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group lead to low yield due to steric hindrance. The physical-chemical insight is adequate. The rule focuses on steric effects, adding complexity. **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** supports the rule with a low yield. Coverage is limited but acceptable given the specificity.

- **Comment 13**:

  Rule 13 specifies that amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups result in low yield. The rule is clear and provides insight into weaker metal coordination due to the absence of effective chelation sites. It considers combinations of structural features. **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** supports the rule with a low yield. Coverage is limited but the rule remains relevant.

- **Comment 14**:

  Rule 14 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with extended conjugation and ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylate result in high yield. The rule provides good physical-chemical insight, emphasizing the role of ketone groups in chelation and the stabilization from conjugation. It combines multiple sub-structures, adding complexity. Supported by **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, which yields a high result, the rule has limited coverage but balances complexity effectively.

- **Comment 15**:

  Rule 15 is clear in indicating that modifiers with amide or acetamido groups distant from the carboxylate result in low yield due to reduced chelation. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight. The rule considers spatial arrangement of functional groups, adding complexity. **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** supports the rule with a low yield. Coverage is limited but acceptable.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **alpha-amino acids with carboxylic acid side chains**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The presence of both amino and carboxylate groups adjacent to each other enhances metal chelation.

   - Examples:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, like **nitro**, **bromomethyl**, or **amino** groups, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination.

   - Examples:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms**, capable of coordinating with metals, result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms provide additional coordination sites, strengthening metal-ligand interactions.

   - Examples:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxylate**, result in a **high yield**. Proximal functional groups facilitate chelation with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long, unbranched hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons)** and no interfering functional groups result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chain may enhance substrate-catalyst interactions.

   - Example:
     - **Octanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate**, capable of forming strong chelates, result in a **high yield**. Multiple coordination points increase catalyst stability.

   - Example:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl**, **methoxy**, or **hydroxyl** groups, result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease carboxylate acidity, weakening metal coordination.

   - Examples:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **functional groups (amino, hydroxyl) located more than three carbons away from the carboxylate** result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **extensive fluorination on the carbon chain** result in a **low yield**. Fluorine atoms withdraw electron density, reducing basicity of the carboxylate oxygen and weakening metal coordination.

   - Example:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **flexible polyether chains attached to the carboxylate**, such as **polyether carboxylic acids**, result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and size of ether chains reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors.

    - Example:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the ortho or para position** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or hinder metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance interferes with effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center.

    - Example:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Without effective chelation sites, metal coordination is weaker.

    - Example:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with extended conjugation and ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. Ketone groups can participate in chelation, and conjugation stabilizes the coordination complex.

    - Example:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **amide or acetamido groups distant from the carboxylate** result in a **low yield**. The separation reduces the likelihood of chelation with the metal center.

    - Example:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 1** - The SMARTS pattern for alpha-amino acids with carboxylic acid side chains (`amino_acid_backbone = '[NX3][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) only captures the standard amino acid backbone but does not account for additional carboxylic acid groups in the side chains. To accurately reflect the rule, the pattern should be modified to include side chains with carboxylic acid groups. Consider adding a pattern that searches for an additional carboxylic acid group connected to the alpha carbon's side chain, for example:
  - `'[NX3][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` (where the second pattern checks for a carboxylic acid group connected to the side chain).

- **Suggestion 2**: **Rule 2** - The pattern for detecting electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position on an aromatic ring (`'c1cc([F,Cl,Br,I,N(=O)=O])ccc1'`) excludes amino groups, which are considered EWGs in this context. The pattern should be updated to include amino groups:
  - `'c1cc([F,Cl,Br,I,N(=O)=O,NH2])ccc1'`.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Rule 2 and Rule 7** - The current SMARTS patterns may not accurately specify substituents at the para position. The pattern `'c1cc([substituent])ccc1'` matches mono-substituted benzenes but does not ensure the substituent is specifically at the para position relative to the carboxylate group. To fix this, the patterns should explicitly define the carboxylic acid and the substituent's positions:
  - For para-substitution: `'c1cc([substituent])cc[c]1C(=O)O'`.
  - This ensures that the substituent and carboxylate are para to each other.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Rule 4** - The patterns for amino or thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxylate (`'[CX4][CX4][CX4][NX3;H2,H1]'` and `'[CX4][CX4][CX4][SX2H]'`) may not capture all variations due to fixed chain lengths and linear structures. Use variable-length patterns with distance constraints:
  - `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]~[CX4]~[CX4]~[NX3;H2,H1]'`.
  - This allows for branching and ensures that the amino or thiol group is within three bonds of the carboxylate.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Rule 5** - The exclusion pattern `'[OH,NH2,NH1,SH]'` might not effectively exclude all interfering functional groups, especially if they're not directly connected to the chain. Use a more comprehensive pattern to exclude molecules containing any hydroxyl, amino, or thiol groups anywhere in the molecule:
  - Exclude patterns: `['[OX2H]', '[NX3;H2,H1]', '[SX2H]']`.
  - Additionally, ensure the hydrocarbon chain is unbranched and at least six carbons long:
    - Pattern: `'[CH3][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Rule 6** - The current pattern searches for at least two hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate but might not specify adjacency properly. Modify the pattern to ensure hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons next to the carboxylate:
  - Pattern: `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][OX2H][CX4][OX2H]'`.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Rule 9** - The threshold of five fluorine atoms (`fluorine_atom: 5`) may not sufficiently capture "extensive fluorination." Adjust the count threshold to a higher number or define a pattern that matches perfluorinated carbon chains:
  - Increase threshold to at least seven fluorine atoms.
  - Pattern for perfluoroalkyl chain: `'[CX4](F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)'`.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Rule 13** - The exclusion patterns may not eliminate all modifiers with additional coordinating groups. Enhance the exclude patterns to include other potential coordinating groups like carboxylic acids and ketones:
  - Exclude patterns: `['[OX2H]', '[NX3;H2,H1]', '[SX2H]', '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0]']`.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Rule 14** - The pattern `'[c][CX3](=O)[c]'` may not sufficiently ensure extended conjugation or position of the ketone group adjacent to the carboxylate. Refine the pattern to capture extended conjugation and adjacency:
  - Pattern: `'c1ccc([CX3](=O)c2ccccc2)cc1C(=O)O'`.
  - Alternatively, use recursive SMARTS to ensure conjugation.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Rule 15** - The pattern `'[CX4]~[CX4]~[CX4][CX3](=O)[NX3]'` might not cover all cases where amide groups are distant from the carboxylate. Use a variable-length linker with a minimum distance:
  - Pattern: `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1].{3,}.[CX3](=O)[NX3]'`.
  - This ensures at least three atoms separate the carboxylate and amide group.

- **Suggestion 11**: **General Improvement** - Use more precise SMARTS syntax and consider molecule stereochemistry where relevant. For example, include chiral centers if they are important for the rules, and ensure that the patterns account for different possible ring sizes and substitutions.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Testing** - Implement unit tests with example molecules for each rule. This will help validate that the SMARTS patterns correctly identify molecules that should match each rule and exclude those that should not.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Descriptions into Quantifiable Features**  
  Convert the current qualitative rules into precise, quantifiable features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "electron-withdrawing groups at the para position," specify the presence of specific functional groups using SMARTS patterns (e.g., `[NX3]=[OX1]` for nitro groups). This allows for automated feature extraction and numerical analysis.

- **Advice 2**: **Implement SMARTS Patterns for Functional Group Identification**  
  Develop a set of SMARTS patterns corresponding to key functional groups mentioned in the rules (e.g., amino, carboxylate, thiol, aldehyde groups). This facilitates the systematic detection of these groups in the modifiers and enables the creation of binary feature vectors representing their presence or absence.

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify Electronic Effects Using Calculated Descriptors**  
  Incorporate calculated electronic descriptors such as Hammett sigma constants, partial charges, or pKa values of the functional groups. These quantitative measures can replace vague terms like "electron-withdrawing" or "electron-donating," providing a numerical basis for predicting yield outcomes.

- **Advice 4**: **Define Steric Factors Using Molecular Descriptors**  
  Quantify steric hindrance by calculating molecular descriptors such as the Sterimol parameters or using the Van der Waals volumes of substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group. This addresses rules related to bulky substituents and their impact on metal coordination.

- **Advice 5**: **Consolidate Redundant and Overlapping Rules**  
  Review and streamline the current rules to reduce redundancy. For instance, rules regarding amino acids with coordinating side chains can be combined, specifying the distance of coordinating groups from the carboxylate (e.g., within three bonds). Simplifying the rules aids in consistent feature extraction.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Topological and Geometric Descriptors**  
  Utilize topological descriptors like the number of rotatable bonds, molecular flexibility indices, or the presence of ring systems. These descriptors can capture the effects of molecular size and flexibility mentioned in the rules, such as the influence of polyether chains on coordination.

- **Advice 7**: **Calculate and Use Physicochemical Properties**  
  Include properties like LogP (partition coefficient), TPSA (topological polar surface area), and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor counts. These properties can reflect the hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of modifiers, correlating with rules about hydrophobic chains enhancing substrate-catalyst interactions.

- **Advice 8**: **Develop a Numerical Scoring System for Coordination Ability**  
  Assign numerical scores to modifiers based on their metal chelation potential. Factors can include the number and type of coordinating atoms (e.g., N, O, S), their distance from the carboxylate group, and the overall geometry. This scoring system can predict the strength of metal-ligand interactions.

- **Advice 9**: **Utilize Machine Learning for Pattern Recognition**  
  Employ machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and identify patterns that may not be apparent from manual rule creation. Techniques like decision trees or random forests can help generate new rules based on feature importance and interactions between descriptors.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Rules with Cross-Validation**  
  Test the revised rules against the existing dataset using statistical methods like cross-validation. Analyze misclassifications to refine the rules further. Continuous validation ensures that the rules are predictive and generalizable to new modifiers.

- **Advice 11**: **Include Negative Examples in Rule Formulation**  
  Ensure that the rules account for modifiers leading to low yields by explicitly incorporating features that negatively affect the reaction. This improves the specificity of the rules and reduces false positives in high-yield predictions.

- **Advice 12**: **Automate Feature Extraction and Rule Application**  
  Develop scripts or software tools that can automatically process SMILES strings, extract the defined features, and apply the rules to predict yields. Automation enhances reproducibility and efficiency in analyzing large datasets.

- **Advice 13**: **Create Hierarchical Rules to Capture Complex Interactions**  
  Structure the rules hierarchically to account for modifiers that meet multiple criteria. For example, a modifier may have both electron-withdrawing groups and steric hindrance. Hierarchical rules can prioritize features based on their impact on yield.

- **Advice 14**: **Collaborate with Computational Chemists for Advanced Descriptors**  
  Work with computational chemistry experts to calculate advanced descriptors like molecular orbitals, electrostatic potentials, or interaction energies with metal ions. These can provide deeper insights into the factors influencing the reaction yield.

- **Advice 15**: **Document and Standardize the Rule-Generating Process**  
  Maintain clear documentation of how rules are derived, including definitions of all descriptors and thresholds used. Standardization ensures consistency in rule application and facilitates updates as new data become available.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **alpha-amino acids with side chains containing carboxylic acid groups**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The presence of both amino and additional carboxylate groups within close proximity enhances chelation with the metal center, facilitating effective catalyst formation.

   - Examples:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro**, **bromomethyl**, or **amino** groups, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination by stabilizing the negative charge on the oxygen.

   - Examples:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl**, **methoxy**, or **hydroxyl** groups, result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, weakening metal coordination due to destabilization of the negative charge.

   - Examples:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
     - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, or thiol) within three carbons of the carboxylate group** result in a **high yield**. Proximal functional groups enhance chelation with the metal center, forming stable bidentate or tridentate ligands.

   - Examples:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, or amide) more than three carbons away from the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in chelating the metal center due to increased flexibility and decreased orbital overlap.

   - Examples:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long, unbranched hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons)** and **no interfering functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may facilitate better interaction with the organic substrate and the catalyst framework.

   - Examples:
     - **Octanoic acid**
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (due to optimal chain length and additional coordination from hydroxyl group)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring**, capable of coordinating with metals, result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms provide additional Lewis basic sites, strengthening metal-ligand interactions through chelation.

   - Examples:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the ortho or para position** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions, such as condensation or oxidation, and may hinder metal coordination due to steric or electronic effects.

   - Examples:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **extensive fluorination on the carbon chain** result in a **low yield**. Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density, reducing the basicity and coordinating ability of the carboxylate oxygen, thus weakening metal coordination.

   - Example:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **large, flexible polyether chains attached to the carboxylate group**, such as **polyether carboxylic acids**, result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk of ether chains reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance interferes with the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate effectively with the metal center.

    - Examples:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan) *(Note: Exception observed; consider the potential for indole nitrogen to coordinate)*

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with adjacent ketone or carbonyl groups**, capable of forming chelates, result in a **high yield**. Carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate enhance coordination through the formation of stable six-membered chelate rings.

    - Examples:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate**, such as in **sugar acids**, result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, forming strong chelates with the metal center.

    - Example:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with pendant aromatic rings containing electron-withdrawing substituents**, result in a **high yield**. The aromatic ring can participate in π-interactions, and electron-withdrawing groups enhance overall coordination ability.

    - Example:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **functional groups that can act as both hydrogen bond donors and acceptors (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) within a rigid framework**, result in a **high yield**. Such groups enhance metal coordination through multiple non-covalent interactions.

    - Example:
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

**Start of Advice**
- **Advice 1**: Simplify the rules by focusing on quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly extracted from SMILES representations. For example, specify the count of carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, and other functional groups in the molecule. This allows for the creation of numerical features based on functional group counts.

- **Advice 2**: Reframe rules to focus on the presence or absence of specific substituents at defined positions. For instance, instead of stating "electron-withdrawing groups at the para position," specify "modifiers with nitro or halogen substituents at the para position of an aromatic ring." This makes the rule precise and easier to encode numerically using position-specific descriptors.

- **Advice 3**: Consolidate rules dealing with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups into a single rule that uses quantifiable electronic parameters, such as Hammett sigma constants or inductive/resonance effects, which can be assigned numerical values for different substituents.

- **Advice 4**: Incorporate molecular properties that can be calculated computationally, such as molecular weight, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor counts. These properties are numerical and can be easily included in a feature matrix.

- **Advice 5**: Use binary descriptors to represent the presence of structural features, such as ring systems (aromatic vs. aliphatic), heteroatoms (nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur), and specific functional groups (amide, ester, thiol). For example, "Modifier contains a pyridine ring (Yes/No)."

- **Advice 6**: Update rules to define clear thresholds for chain lengths or distances between functional groups. Instead of qualitative terms like "medium-length hydrocarbon chains," specify the exact carbon chain length (e.g., "Modifiers with unbranched hydrocarbon chains of 6–8 carbons result in a high yield").

- **Advice 7**: Replace ambiguous terms like "bulky substituents" with quantifiable steric parameters, such as the Taft steric parameter (Es) or by calculating the van der Waals volume of the substituent. This allows for numerical representation of steric effects.

- **Advice 8**: Introduce rules based on the chelation ability quantified by calculating the number of potential chelating sites within a certain distance from the carboxylic acid group. For example, "Modifiers with two or more heteroatoms within three bonds of the carboxylate group result in a high yield."

- **Advice 9**: Use cheminformatics tools to extract numerical descriptors related to electronic properties, such as partial charges on atoms, HOMO-LUMO gaps, or electrostatic potentials, which can influence metal coordination.

- **Advice 10**: Reevaluate the existing rules for overlap and redundancy, and merge similar rules to create a more streamlined set. This can help in reducing complexity and improving the statistical significance of each rule when translated into numerical features.

Rule Generator Message:
After analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical properties of the modifiers, here are the rules that describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the yield of the reaction:

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with carboxylic acid side chains**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The presence of multiple carboxylate groups adjacent to an amino group enhances coordination with the metal center through bidentate chelation.

   - Examples:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro** or **bromomethyl** groups, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination by stabilizing the negative charge.

   - Examples:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position** result in a **high yield**. The amino group can act as an additional coordination site, forming stronger complexes with the metal center.

   - Example:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring** result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

   - Examples:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, or thiol) within three carbons of the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. These functional groups enhance chelation with the metal center by forming stable bidentate ligands.

   - Examples:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with adjacent hydroxyl or carbonyl groups capable of chelation** result in a **high yield**. The adjacent functional groups facilitate the formation of stable chelate rings with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the ortho or para position** result in a **low yield**. The aldehyde groups may participate in side reactions or hinder metal coordination due to steric effects.

   - Examples:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups (more than three carbons away from the carboxylate)** result in a **low yield**. The increased flexibility and distance reduce effective chelation with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position** (excluding amino groups) result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, weakening coordination with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with bulky, sterically hindering groups adjacent to the carboxylate and lack additional coordinating sites** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance interferes with effective metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

    - Example:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long polyether chains attached to the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk of the ether chains reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length (6-8 carbons) unbranched hydrocarbon chains without interfering functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with the catalyst framework.

    - Example:
      - **Octanoic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky side chains lacking additional coordinating groups**, such as aromatic rings without coordinating heteroatoms, result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids** result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups form strong bonds with metals, enhancing catalyst stability.

    - Example:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position yield high results, with 4-aminobenzoic acid (entry 4) supporting this. This meets the **Clarity** criterion. The property insight is sound, as the amino group provides an additional coordination site (**Property Insight**). However, the rule is supported by only one data point, which is minimal for the **Coverage** criterion. The rule does consider combined substructures (**Complexity**).

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in its description of heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms resulting in high yield. Supported by entries 8, 16, and 22, all showing high yield, it satisfies the **Clarity** and **Coverage** criteria. The property insight about nitrogen atoms enhancing metal-ligand interactions is solid (**Property Insight**). It considers complex substructures (**Complexity**).

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal functional groups within three carbons result in high yield, which is clear (**Clarity**). Supported by entries 3 and 18, it meets the **Coverage** criterion. The property insight concerning chelation through proximal groups is reasonable (**Property Insight**). The rule involves combinations of functional groups (**Complexity**).

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in stating that carboxylic acids with adjacent hydroxyl or carbonyl groups capable of chelation lead to high yield. Supported by entries 9 and 17 (both high yield), it meets the **Clarity** and **Coverage** criteria. The property insight about chelate ring formation is appropriate (**Property Insight**), and complex substructures are considered (**Complexity**).

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups at ortho or para positions result in low yield, supported by entries 20 and 19 (both low yield), satisfying the **Clarity** and **Coverage** criteria. The property insight about side reactions or steric hindrance is valid (**Property Insight**), and the rule considers combinations of substructures (**Complexity**).

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear in that aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups lead to low yield, supported by entries 31, 34, and 29 (all low yield), satisfying the **Clarity** and **Coverage** criteria. The property insight regarding reduced chelation due to increased distance is acceptable (**Property Insight**). It involves combinations of substructures (**Complexity**).

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position (excluding amino groups) result in low yield, which is clear (**Clarity**). Supported by entries 23 and 30 (both low yield), it meets the **Coverage** criterion. The property insight about decreased acidity weakening metal coordination is valid (**Property Insight**). The rule considers combined substructures (**Complexity**).

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly states that carboxylic acids with bulky, sterically hindering groups adjacent to the carboxylate and lacking additional coordinating sites lead to low yield. Supported by entries 13 and 12 (both low yield), it meets the **Clarity** and **Coverage** criteria. The property insight regarding steric hindrance interfering with coordination is sound (**Property Insight**). It involves complex substructures (**Complexity**).

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear in stating that carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield, supported by entry 14 (low yield). While the property insight about electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms is valid (**Property Insight**), the rule is supported by only one data point, which is minimal for the **Coverage** criterion. The rule considers specific substructures (**Complexity**).

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 specifies that modifiers with long polyether chains attached to the carboxylate group result in low yield, which is clear (**Clarity**). Supported by entry 11 (low yield), the **Coverage** is minimal. The property insight about steric hindrance and entropic factors is acceptable (**Property Insight**). The rule involves complex substructures (**Complexity**).

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length unbranched hydrocarbon chains result in high yield, exemplified by octanoic acid (entry 5, high yield). The rule is clear (**Clarity**), but only supported by one data point (**Coverage** is minimal). The property insight is speculative (**Property Insight**). It considers specific substructures (**Complexity**).

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 suggests that amino acids with bulky side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yield. While phenylalanine (entry 13, low yield) supports this, tryptophan (entry 15) contradicts it by showing a high yield, violating the **Clarity** criterion and bringing into question the rule's validity. The property insight about steric hindrance is insufficient to explain the exception (**Property Insight**). The rule's complexity is acceptable, but inconsistent data undermines its **Coverage**.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 claims that thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids result in high yield, but 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (entry 10) shows a low yield, directly contradicting the rule and violating the **Clarity** criterion. The property insight about strong metal-thiol bonds does not align with the observed data (**Property Insight**). The rule lacks supportive data points (**Coverage**) and may oversimplify the effect of thiol groups (**Complexity**).

**End of Comments**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Re-evaluate Rule 14 to reflect contradictory data.** In Rule 14, the assertion is that amino acids with bulky side chains lacking additional coordinating groups result in a low yield due to steric hindrance. However, the example of **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan, entry 15) shows a **high yield**, contradicting the rule. To improve accuracy, adjust the rule to account for exceptions where bulky side chains contain heteroatoms (like nitrogen in the indole ring) that can participate in coordination with the metal center. Consider revising the rule as:

  - **Revised Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms** result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and lack of additional coordination sites.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Advice 2**: **Correct Rule 15 based on dataset evidence.** Rule 15 states that thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids result in a high yield due to strong metal-thiol bonds. However, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (entry 10) shows a **low yield**, which contradicts the rule. This suggests that thiol groups may not enhance yield in this context, possibly due to thiol oxidation or catalyst poisoning. Re-express the rule or remove it if not supported by data. An alternative could be:

  - **Revised Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids** result in a **low yield**. Thiol groups may lead to catalyst deactivation or side reactions that reduce effectiveness.

    - Example:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Advice 3**: **Increase supporting data for rules with limited examples.** Rules like **Rule 3** (aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position resulting in high yield) are supported by a single data point (**4-aminobenzoic acid**). To strengthen these rules, incorporate additional data points or combine similar rules to enhance validity. For instance, search for other modifiers in the dataset or literature with similar structures to confirm the rule's applicability.

- **Advice 4**: **Clarify ambiguous terms in rules for better precision.** Phrases like "interfering functional groups" in **Rule 13** and "bulky, sterically hindering groups" in **Rule 10** can be subjective. Provide specific definitions or examples of what constitutes interfering functional groups or specify a steric parameter (like molecular volume or specific substituents) to improve clarity.

  - For example, **Rule 13** could be revised to:

    - **Revised Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length (6-8 carbons) unbranched hydrocarbon chains and **no additional polar or coordinating functional groups** result in a **high yield**.

- **Advice 5**: **Consolidate overlapping rules to improve coherence.** Some rules may overlap or can be merged for simplicity. For instance, **Rule 2** and **Rule 3** both deal with aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents at the para position affecting yield but focus on different substituents (electron-withdrawing vs. amino groups). Consider combining them into a broader rule that encompasses substituents enhancing metal coordination, specifying exceptions as needed.

- **Advice 6**: **Adjust rules based on exceptions and dataset contradictions.** Address any inconsistencies by refining the rules. For example, modify **Rule 14** to account for exceptions like tryptophan and specify conditions under which bulky side chains negatively affect yield. Similarly, update **Rule 15** based on the observed low yield with thiol-containing modifiers.

- **Advice 7**: **Ensure each rule is supported by multiple data points.** For stronger reliability, aim for at least two to three supporting examples per rule. If a rule lacks sufficient data, consider merging it with another rule or collecting additional data to validate it.

- **Advice 8**: **Reassess property insights where data does not align.** If the proposed chemical rationale (property insight) does not match the experimental outcomes, revisit the underlying assumptions. For instance, re-evaluate the assumption in **Rule 15** that thiol groups enhance catalyst stability when data suggests otherwise.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate additional rules to cover unexplained data points.** Identify modifiers in the dataset that do not fit existing rules and develop new rules or expand current ones to explain their yields. For example, address why **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) yields high results despite a bulky side chain.

- **Advice 10**: **Review and verify dataset entries for accuracy.** Ensure that all data points are correctly classified in terms of yield and molecular structure. Any errors in the dataset could mislead rule generation and validation. Confirm that SMILES representations, names, and yield classifications are accurate.

Current rules:
After analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical properties of the modifiers, here are the rules that describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the yield of the reaction:

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with carboxylic acid side chains**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The presence of multiple carboxylate groups adjacent to an amino group enhances coordination with the metal center through bidentate chelation.

   - Examples:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro** or **bromomethyl** groups, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination by stabilizing the negative charge.

   - Examples:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position** result in a **high yield**. The amino group can act as an additional coordination site, forming stronger complexes with the metal center.

   - Example:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring** result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

   - Examples:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, or thiol) within three carbons of the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. These functional groups enhance chelation with the metal center by forming stable bidentate ligands.

   - Examples:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with adjacent hydroxyl or carbonyl groups capable of chelation** result in a **high yield**. The adjacent functional groups facilitate the formation of stable chelate rings with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the ortho or para position** result in a **low yield**. The aldehyde groups may participate in side reactions or hinder metal coordination due to steric effects.

   - Examples:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups (more than three carbons away from the carboxylate)** result in a **low yield**. The increased flexibility and distance reduce effective chelation with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position** (excluding amino groups) result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, weakening coordination with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with bulky, sterically hindering groups adjacent to the carboxylate and lack additional coordinating sites** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance interferes with effective metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

    - Example:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long polyether chains attached to the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk of the ether chains reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length (6-8 carbons) unbranched hydrocarbon chains without interfering functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with the catalyst framework.

    - Example:
      - **Octanoic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky side chains lacking additional coordinating groups**, such as aromatic rings without coordinating heteroatoms, result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids** result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups form strong bonds with metals, enhancing catalyst stability.

    - Example:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Expand SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing groups in Rule 2**. The current code only checks for nitro groups (`[NX3](=O)=O`) as electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. However, the rule mentions other groups like bromomethyl. Update the code to include additional electron-withdrawing groups such as halogens (`[F,Cl,Br,I]`), cyano (`[C#N]`), trifluoromethyl (`[CX4](F)(F)F`), and sulfonyl groups. Also, ensure that these groups are specifically at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid on an aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Refine the definition of electron-donating groups in Rule 9**. The current code only checks for hydroxyl groups (`[OX2H]`) as electron-donating groups. The rule specifies electron-donating groups excluding amino groups. Expand the SMARTS patterns to include other electron-donating groups like methoxy (`[OX2][CH3]`), alkyl groups (`[CX4H3]`), and alkoxyl groups. Also, ensure that these groups are at the para position of the aromatic carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Improve distance calculations in Rules 5 and 8**. The code currently calculates the shortest path between the first atom of each matching substructure, which may not accurately represent the actual distance between functional groups. Modify the code to calculate the shortest path between any atom of the carboxylic acid group and any atom of the functional group (amino, hydroxyl, or thiol). This provides a more accurate assessment of the proximity between groups.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Enhance adjacency checks in Rule 6**. The current code checks if the carboxylic acid is adjacent to a hydroxyl or ketone group by verifying a path length of 1 bond between the first atoms of the matching substructures. Update the code to check for direct bonds between the functional groups or through common atoms to ensure true adjacency.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Specify bulky groups explicitly for Rule 10**. The code only considers tert-butyl groups as bulky groups adjacent to the carboxylate. Expand the SMARTS patterns to include other bulky substituents like isopropyl (`[CX4]([CH3])[CH3]`), tert-butyl (`[CX4]([CH3])([CH3])[CH3]`), phenyl (`[c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1`), and other large substituents. Also, ensure that these bulky groups are directly adjacent to the carboxylate group.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Correct perfluorinated chain detection in Rule 11**. The current code checks for a trifluoromethyl group (`[CX4]([F])([F])[F]`), which may not capture perfluorinated alkyl chains effectively. Update the SMARTS pattern to detect longer perfluorinated chains, such as `[CX4](F)(F)[CX2](F)[CX2](F)`, to match perfluorinated alkyl chains more accurately.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Refine the identification of long polyether chains in Rule 12**. The code uses the pattern `OCCOCCO` to detect polyether chains, which may not capture variations in chain length or branching. Modify the SMARTS pattern to match ethylene glycol repeats, such as `(OCC)n`, with `n` greater than a certain value, using recursive SMARTS or by counting occurrences.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Improve chain length assessment in Rule 13**. The code checks for any occurrence of an unbranched chain of 6 carbons (`[C][C][C][C][C][C]`), regardless of its connection to the carboxylic acid. Modify the code to ensure that the unbranched hydrocarbon chain is directly connected to the carboxylic acid group and that it is the main chain of the molecule.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Clarify bulky side chains in Rule 14**. The current code checks for phenyl and pyridine rings but may miss other bulky side chains like indole, naphthalene, or tert-butyl groups. Expand the SMARTS patterns to include these groups and ensure that they are connected to the amino acid backbone without additional coordinating heteroatoms.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Ensure correct matching of thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids in Rule 15**. The code should verify that both the thiol group and the carboxylic acid are attached to the same aromatic ring. Update the SMARTS pattern to reflect this specific connectivity, such as `[c][SX2H]` and `[c][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` on the same ring system.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Use more precise SMARTS patterns for functional groups**. Review and update the SMARTS definitions to accurately represent functional groups, taking into account resonance structures, tautomerization, and aromaticity. This ensures that substructure searches match the intended functional groups in various chemical contexts.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Add logging or verbose output for debugging**. Implement logging statements in the code to output detailed information about which rules are applied to each molecule and why certain molecules do not match specific rules. This assists in troubleshooting and verifying the correctness of the transformations.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Handle stereochemistry explicitly if relevant**. Some rules might be affected by the stereochemistry of the molecules (e.g., coordination through specific stereocenters). Ensure that the code accounts for stereochemistry where applicable.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Validate code with test cases**. Create a set of test molecules with known outcomes for each rule to validate that the code correctly identifies matches and non-matches. This helps in verifying that the code changes lead to the desired improvements.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Refactor code for clarity and maintainability**. Organize the code by separating rule definitions, SMARTS patterns, and processing logic. This makes the code easier to understand, update, and debug, facilitating future enhancements.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

After carefully analyzing the current rule metrics and comparing them with the reference metrics from previous iterations, we can observe several key points regarding the performance of the current rules, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**.

---

### **Comparison with Previous Metrics**

#### **1. Confidence**

- **Previous Mean Train Confidence**: 
  - \( \frac{0.6352 + 0.5396}{2} \approx 0.5874 \)
- **Current Train Confidence**: 
  - **Iteration Results**:
    - Rule 1: 0.7444
    - Rule 2: 0.7031
    - Rule 3: 0.7238
    - Rule 4: 0.4619
    - Rule 5: 0.5968
  - **Overall Current Mean** (from summary): 0.6576

**Observation**: The current average train confidence of **0.6576** represents an improvement over the previous mean confidence of **0.5874**. Rules 1, 2, and 3, in particular, exhibit high confidence values exceeding 0.7, indicating that the conditions specified in these rules are strong predictors of the desired outcome (high yield). Rule 4, however, shows a lower confidence of 0.4619.

#### **2. Lift**

- **Previous Mean Train Lift**:
  - \( \frac{1.2048 + 1.0559}{2} \approx 1.1304 \)
- **Current Train Lift**:
  - **Iteration Results**:
    - Rule 1: 1.4997
    - Rule 2: 1.4033
    - Rule 3: 1.4661
    - Rule 4: 0.9120
    - Rule 5: 1.2005
  - **Overall Current Mean** (from summary): 1.3161

**Observation**: The current average train lift of **1.3161** is higher than the previous mean lift of **1.1304**, indicating that the current rules are more effective at identifying associations that are not merely due to chance. High lift values (greater than 1) for Rules 1, 2, 3, and 5 suggest that these rules are meaningful and provide valuable insights. Rule 4 has a lift less than 1 (0.9120), implying that the rule condition is not associated with the prediction.

#### **3. Support**

- **Previous Mean Train Support**:
  - \( \frac{0.1667 + 0.1845}{2} \approx 0.1756 \)
- **Current Train Support**:
  - **Iteration Results**:
    - Rule 1: 0.0476
    - Rule 2: 0.0357
    - Rule 3: 0.0819
    - Rule 4: 0.1357
    - Rule 5: 0.0648
  - **Overall Current Mean** (from summary): 0.0800

**Observation**: The current train support is lower than the previous mean support. While higher support is generally desirable as it indicates the rule applies to a larger portion of the data, the increased confidence and lift values suggest that the current rules, though covering fewer instances, are more precise.

#### **4. Leverage**

- **Previous Mean Train Leverage**:
  - \( \frac{0.0289 + (-0.0041)}{2} \approx 0.0124 \)
- **Current Train Leverage**:
  - **Iteration Results**:
    - Rule 1: 0.0163
    - Rule 2: 0.0065
    - Rule 3: 0.0128
    - Rule 4: \(-0.0039\)
    - Rule 5: 0.0021
  - **Overall Current Mean** (from summary): 0.0060

**Observation**: The current leverage values are positive for most rules, indicating stronger associations than expected by chance. Rule 4 has a negative leverage, suggesting a weaker association.

---

### **Assessment of Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency**

The improvements in **confidence** and **lift** compared to previous iterations suggest progress towards optimizing the rules. However, the diminishing returns in metric improvements and the presence of some rules with lower performance (e.g., Rule 4) may indicate that we are approaching a local minimum.

- **Local Minimum**: The current metrics show significant improvement over the previous baseline, but the marginal gains from the last few iterations are decreasing. This plateau suggests that the current set of rules might be near a local optimum in the current solution space.

- **Iterations**: Considering the reduced rate of improvement and the consistency of high-performing rules (e.g., Rules 1, 2, and 3), it might be appropriate to consider that enough iterations have been conducted. Further iterations may result in overfitting or negligible metric enhancements.

---

### **Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

Based on the detailed analysis of the metrics and the rules, here are suggestions for refining and improving the current set of rules:

#### **1. Focus on High-Performing Rules**

- **Retain and Emphasize Rules with High Confidence and Lift**:
  - **Rules 1, 2, and 3** have high confidence (over 0.7) and high lift (over 1.4), indicating strong and reliable associations.
  - These rules should be prioritized as key findings in the research program.

#### **2. Re-evaluate Low-Performing Rules**

- **Rule 4**:
  - **Metrics**: Confidence of 0.4619 and a lift of 0.9120 (less than 1), with negative leverage.
  - **Action**: Reconsider or revise Rule 4. The low confidence and lift indicate that the rule may not reliably predict high yields. Investigate whether the heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring consistently result in high yields or if specific subclasses perform differently.

#### **3. Increase Support without Compromising Confidence**

- **Expand Rule Applicability**:
  - Look for ways to generalize high-performing rules slightly to encompass more data points without significantly reducing confidence and lift.
  - **Example**: If Rule 3 applies to para-substituted amino groups, consider if meta-substituted amino groups also contribute to high yields.

#### **4. Analyze Exceptions and Outliers**

- Investigate any data points that do not conform to the high-performing rules.
  - Determine if there are specific modifiers that defy the trends. This could reveal additional factors affecting yield.

#### **5. Refine Rule Definitions**

- **Incorporate Additional Chemical Insights**:
  - Consider adding more nuanced chemical properties to the rules, such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, or specific functional group interactions.
  - **Example**: For Rule 5, specify the optimal distance between functional groups and the carboxylate for effective chelation.

#### **6. Remove or Merge Redundant Rules**

- Identify rules that overlap significantly or do not contribute uniquely to the predictive power.
  - **Example**: If Rule 14 (modifiers with bulky non-coordinating side chains leading to low yield) overlaps with Rule 10, consider merging them for clarity.

#### **7. Validate Rules with Test Data**

- Although test metrics are not provided in the current iteration, it's crucial to verify that the rules perform well on unseen data to ensure generalizability.
  - Consider conducting cross-validation or testing on a separate dataset.

#### **8. Consider Negative Associations**

- **Leverage Negative Associations**:
  - Rules predicting low yield (e.g., Rules 7, 8, 9, 10, and 14) should be assessed for their ability to reliably exclude ineffective modifiers.
  - Ensure that these rules have sufficient confidence and lift (even if indicating a negative outcome) to be useful.

---

### **Conclusion**

The current set of rules shows an overall improvement in confidence and lift compared to previous iterations, indicating progress in capturing the underlying relationships in the dataset. However, there is room for refinement:

- **Enhance High-Performing Rules**: Focus on rules with high confidence and lift to strengthen the predictive model.
- **Revise or Eliminate Low-Performing Rules**: Address rules with low confidence or lift below 1, as they may not contribute positively.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be optimized further, potentially moving beyond the local minimum and achieving better predictive performance.

---

**Next Steps**:

- Apply the suggested improvements to the rules.
- Recalculate the metrics to assess the impact of the changes.
- Continue iterating until the metrics stabilize without significant improvement, indicating that an optimal set of rules has been reached.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Validation and Training Accuracies:**

The recent 5-fold cross-validation accuracy of **54.29%** indicates that our classification model's performance is only slightly better than random chance (which would be 50% for a binary classification). This is a noticeable decline compared to previous iterations, where validation accuracies were consistently around **76%**, and test accuracies were **75%** or **62.5%**. The accuracies during the current iteration have fluctuated as follows:

- **First Iteration:** 74.29%
- **Second Iteration:** 65.71%
- **Third Iteration:** 68.57%
- **Fourth Iteration:** 48.57%
- **Fifth Iteration:** 51.43%
- **Current Iteration:** **54.29%**

This downward trend and inconsistency suggest that the current set of rules may not be capturing the essential features necessary for accurate predictions, indicating potential issues with our model's effectiveness.

**SHAP Value Analysis:**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into how each rule (feature) contributes to the model's predictions for each molecule. By examining the SHAP values in cases where the model's predictions do not match the experimental values, we can identify which rules may be contributing to incorrect predictions.

- **Cases of Overestimation (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**
  - **Rule 8** frequently exhibits high positive SHAP values in these cases. This suggests that Rule 8 is significantly contributing to overestimating the loading.
  - **Rule 7** also shows positive SHAP values, indicating it may be influencing the model toward predicting higher loadings where it should not.

- **Cases of Underestimation (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**
  - **Rule 1** often has high negative SHAP values in these instances, suggesting that it is contributing to underestimating the loading.
  - **Rule 5** sometimes shows negative SHAP values, indicating it may be suppressing the prediction of higher loadings in certain molecules.

**Assessment of Current Rules’ Effectiveness:**

The decline in validation accuracy and the patterns observed in the SHAP analysis suggest that the current rules are not sufficiently effective. Some rules may be too broadly defined, too restrictive, or not accurately reflecting the underlying chemistry that influences catalyst loading. The model may be overemphasizing certain features while neglecting others, leading to poor generalization.

**Overfitting/Underfitting Considerations:**

Given the fluctuating accuracies and low performance relative to earlier iterations, the model may be experiencing:

- **Underfitting:** The current rules may be too simplistic or not comprehensive enough to capture the complexity of the data, causing the model to perform poorly on both training and validation sets.
- **Possible Overfitting in Adjustments:** Adjustments made in previous iterations may have inadvertently overfitted the model to specific data points, reducing its ability to generalize.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

The lack of consistent improvement in accuracy metrics suggests that the current approach to refining the rules is not effectively enhancing the model's predictive capabilities. This plateau or decline in performance indicates that we may have reached a local minimum where additional minor adjustments are unlikely to yield significant improvements.

**Insights from SHAP Analysis for Rule Improvement:**

- **Rule 8 Issues:**
  - **Observation:** Rule 8 has high positive SHAP values in overestimated cases.
  - **Interpretation:** Rule 8 may be too broadly defined, causing the model to overpredict high loading for modifiers where it is not warranted.

- **Rule 1 Issues:**
  - **Observation:** Rule 1 has high negative SHAP values in underestimated cases.
  - **Interpretation:** Rule 1 might be too restrictive or missing critical functional groups, leading to underprediction of loading for certain modifiers.

- **Rule 5 Concerns:**
  - **Observation:** Negative SHAP values in some underestimated cases.
  - **Interpretation:** Rule 5 may need refinement to better capture the nuances of how proximal functional groups affect loading.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Rule 8:**

   - **Current Definition:** Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups (more than three carbons away from the carboxylate) result in low yield.
   - **Issue:** Rule 8 may be too general, causing overestimation in molecules where the distal functional groups do not significantly impact the loading.
   - **Suggestion:** Narrow the scope of Rule 8 by specifying which distal functional groups lead to low yield. Consider adding exceptions or additional criteria, such as the presence of interfering functional groups or steric hindrance that specifically contribute to low loading.

2. **Adjust Rule 1:**

   - **Current Definition:** Modifiers that are amino acids with carboxylic acid side chains result in high yield.
   - **Issue:** Rule 1 may be too narrow, excluding similar compounds that also contribute to high loading, or too broad, including molecules that do not enhance loading.
   - **Suggestion:** Expand Rule 1 to include other amino acids or derivatives that have similar chelating abilities. Incorporate additional functional groups that can enhance metal coordination, such as hydroxyl or thiol groups adjacent to the amino group.

3. **Review Rule 5:**

   - **Current Definition:** Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, or thiol) within three carbons of the carboxylate result in high yield.
   - **Issue:** The definition of "within three carbons" may not adequately capture the effect of these functional groups on loading.
   - **Suggestion:** Reassess the distance criterion and consider the strength of the functional group's coordinating ability. Adjust the rule to account for the nature and position of the functional group, possibly including resonance effects or specific structural configurations that enhance chelation.

4. **Reevaluate Rule 7:**

   - **Current Definition:** Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups at the ortho or para position result in low yield.
   - **Issue:** High positive SHAP values in overestimations suggest that Rule 7 may not be accurately predicting low yield in some cases.
   - **Suggestion:** Investigate whether all aldehyde-containing aromatic carboxylic acids indeed result in low yield or if exceptions exist. Modify the rule to include additional factors that may influence the outcome, such as electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects of other substituents.

5. **Enhance Rule Specificity:**

   - Introduce more specific structural criteria in the rules, such as ring size, degree of saturation, or presence of heteroatoms, to better distinguish between modifiers that lead to high or low yield.
   - Incorporate quantitative descriptors, like pKa values or steric parameters, to provide a more nuanced understanding of how modifiers interact with the catalyst.

6. **Address Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   - **Overfitting:** Simplify overly complex rules that may be too closely tailored to the training data.
   - **Underfitting:** Add new rules or modify existing ones to capture important patterns not currently represented, ensuring that the model can generalize to unseen data.

7. **Incorporate Additional Data:**

   - Use experimental data to identify patterns or exceptions that can inform rule refinement.
   - Validate the revised rules with a separate dataset to assess their predictive power.

8. **Iterative Testing and Validation:**

   - After modifying the rules, re-evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation to ensure that changes lead to actual improvements.
   - Monitor both accuracy metrics and SHAP value distributions to detect any new issues arising from the adjustments.

**Conclusion:**

The current decline in model accuracy and the insights from the SHAP analysis indicate a need for significant refinement of the existing rules. By focusing on rules associated with mispredictions—such as refining Rule 8 to prevent overestimations and adjusting Rule 1 to prevent underestimations—we can enhance the model's predictive capabilities. It is crucial to balance the specificity and generality of the rules to improve the model's performance while avoiding overfitting or underfitting. Through careful analysis and iterative refinement, we can develop a more effective set of rules that better represent the complex relationship between molecular modifiers and catalyst loading.

**Summary of Discussions and Suggestions for Improvement**

**1. Overview of Current Rule Performance**

- **Metrics Analysis**: The current rules exhibit an average train confidence of **65.76%** and an average train lift of **1.3161**. While these values represent an improvement over previous iterations, there are inconsistencies among individual rules. **Rules 1, 2, and 3** show high confidence and lift values, indicating strong predictive power. In contrast, **Rule 4** has lower performance metrics, suggesting it may not be as effective.

- **Validation Accuracy**: The 5-fold cross-validation accuracy has declined to **54.29%**, which is only slightly better than random chance for binary classification. This is a significant drop from previous accuracies of around **74-76%**, indicating issues with the current set of rules.

- **SHAP Analysis**: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions. In cases where the model's predictions do not match experimental values, certain rules (e.g., **Rule 8**) are contributing to overestimations, while others (e.g., **Rule 1**) are contributing to underestimations.

**2. Observations from Metrics and SHAP Analysis**

- **High-Performing Rules**: Rules with high confidence and lift (e.g., **Rules 1, 2, and 3**) are strong predictors of high yield and should be prioritized.

- **Low-Performing Rules**: Rules with low confidence or lift less than 1 (e.g., **Rule 4**) may not be reliable and need reevaluation or refinement.

- **Underfitting Concerns**: The decline in validation accuracy suggests that the model may be underfitting due to oversimplification or inadequate representation of the underlying chemical relationships.

- **Rule Contributions**: Misaligned SHAP values indicate that some rules may be either too broad or too narrow, leading to incorrect predictions.

**3. Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**

**Refinements and Adjustments:**

- **Expand Electron-Withdrawing Groups in Rule 2**:
  - **Issue**: Currently only nitro groups are considered.
  - **Action**: Update SMARTS patterns to include additional electron-withdrawing groups such as halogens (`[F,Cl,Br,I]`), cyano (`[C#N]`), trifluoromethyl (`[CX4](F)(F)F`), and sulfonyl (`[SX4](=O)(=O)[OX2H0]`) groups at the para position.

- **Refine Electron-Donating Groups in Rule 9**:
  - **Issue**: Only hydroxyl groups are considered.
  - **Action**: Incorporate other electron-donating groups like methoxy (`[OX2][CH3]`), alkyl groups (`[CX4H3]`), and alkoxyl groups. Ensure these are at the para position on the aromatic ring.

- **Improve Distance Calculations in Rules 5 and 8**:
  - **Issue**: Current method may not accurately represent functional group proximity.
  - **Action**: Calculate the shortest path between any atom in the carboxylic acid group and any atom in the functional group, rather than between the first atoms of each substructure.

- **Enhance Adjacency Checks in Rule 6**:
  - **Issue**: Adjacency may not be accurately determined.
  - **Action**: Check for direct bonding or common atoms between the carboxylic acid and adjacent functional groups (hydroxyl or carbonyl) to ensure true chelation capability.

- **Specify Bulky Groups Explicitly in Rule 10**:
  - **Issue**: Only tert-butyl groups are considered.
  - **Action**: Expand the SMARTS patterns to include other bulky groups such as isopropyl (`[CX4]([CH3])[CH3]`), phenyl (`c1ccccc1`), and napthyl groups, ensuring these are adjacent to the carboxylate.

- **Correct Perfluorinated Chain Detection in Rule 11**:
  - **Issue**: Only trifluoromethyl groups are considered.
  - **Action**: Adjust SMARTS patterns to detect longer perfluorinated chains, e.g., `[*][CX4](F)(F)[CX2](F)[CX2](F)`.

- **Refine Identification of Polyether Chains in Rule 12**:
  - **Issue**: Current pattern may miss variations in chain length.
  - **Action**: Use recursive SMARTS patterns to identify ethylene glycol repeats, e.g., `(OCC)n` where `n > 2`.

- **Improve Chain Length Assessment in Rule 13**:
  - **Issue**: Unbranched chains may not be correctly identified.
  - **Action**: Ensure that the unbranched hydrocarbon chain is directly connected to the carboxylic acid and is the main chain of the molecule.

- **Clarify Bulky Side Chains in Rule 14**:
  - **Issue**: Other bulky side chains may be missed.
  - **Action**: Include groups like indole, naphthalene, and other large substituents in SMARTS patterns, ensuring they lack additional coordinating heteroatoms.

- **Ensure Correct Matching in Rule 15**:
  - **Issue**: Thiol and carboxylic acid may not be on the same aromatic ring.
  - **Action**: Update SMARTS patterns to ensure both functional groups are connected to the same ring system.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- **Use More Precise SMARTS Patterns**:
  - Update SMARTS definitions to accurately represent functional groups, considering aromaticity, resonance, and tautomerization.

- **Add Logging for Debugging**:
  - Implement logging to output which rules are applied to each molecule, aiding in debugging and validation.

- **Validate Rules with Test Cases**:
  - Create a set of test molecules with known outcomes to verify that rules correctly identify matches and non-matches.

- **Refactor Code for Clarity and Maintainability**:
  - Organize code by separating rule definitions, SMARTS patterns, and processing logic for better readability and easier updates.

**4. Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is **significant potential for further optimization** of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Underfitting Issue**: The decline in validation accuracy suggests that the model is underfitting. The rules may not be capturing all relevant patterns due to overly simplistic or inaccurate definitions.

- **Rule Refinement**: By refining the rules to more precisely reflect the underlying chemical principles, we can improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

- **Avoiding Overfitting**: Ensuring that rules are neither too broad nor too narrow, validating them with cross-validation and external test sets, and avoiding tailoring rules to specific data points will help prevent overfitting.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules requires further optimization to improve the predictive performance of the model. By implementing the suggested refinements and ensuring that the rules accurately capture the chemical relationships influencing yield, we can enhance the model's effectiveness without overfitting.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    After analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical properties of the modifiers, here are the rules that describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the yield of the reaction:

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with carboxylic acid side chains**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The presence of multiple carboxylate groups adjacent to an amino group enhances coordination with the metal center through bidentate chelation.

   - Examples:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro** or **bromomethyl** groups, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination by stabilizing the negative charge.

   - Examples:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position** result in a **high yield**. The amino group can act as an additional coordination site, forming stronger complexes with the metal center.

   - Example:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring** result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

   - Examples:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, or thiol) within three carbons of the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. These functional groups enhance chelation with the metal center by forming stable bidentate ligands.

   - Examples:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with adjacent hydroxyl or carbonyl groups capable of chelation** result in a **high yield**. The adjacent functional groups facilitate the formation of stable chelate rings with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the ortho or para position** result in a **low yield**. The aldehyde groups may participate in side reactions or hinder metal coordination due to steric effects.

   - Examples:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups (more than three carbons away from the carboxylate)** result in a **low yield**. The increased flexibility and distance reduce effective chelation with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position** (excluding amino groups) result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, weakening coordination with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with bulky, sterically hindering groups adjacent to the carboxylate and lack additional coordinating sites** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance interferes with effective metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

    - Example:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long polyether chains attached to the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk of the ether chains reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length (6-8 carbons) unbranched hydrocarbon chains without interfering functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with the catalyst framework.

    - Example:
      - **Octanoic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky side chains lacking additional coordinating groups**, such as aromatic rings without coordinating heteroatoms, result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids** result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups form strong bonds with metals, enhancing catalyst stability.

    - Example:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Expand Electron-Withdrawing Groups in Rule 2**

  - **Issue**: Rule 2 currently only includes nitro and bromomethyl groups as electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids.
  - **Action**: Modify the SMARTS pattern in Rule 2 to include additional electron-withdrawing groups such as halogens (`F`, `Cl`, `Br`, `I`), cyano (`CN`), trifluoromethyl (`CF3`), and sulfonyl (`SO2R`) groups. Ensure that these substituents are specifically at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Update the SMARTS pattern to detect these groups at the para position: `c1ccc([C](=O)[O-])c([EWG])c1`, where `[EWG]` represents the electron-withdrawing groups mentioned.
    - Define `[EWG]` as `[F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-],C#N,C(F)(F)F,S(=O)(=O)[O-]`.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Electron-Donating Groups in Rule 9**

  - **Issue**: Rule 9 currently only considers hydroxyl groups as electron-donating substituents at the para position.
  - **Action**: Expand the SMARTS pattern to include other electron-donating groups such as methoxy (`OCH3`), alkyl groups (`CH3`, `CH2CH3`), and alkoxy groups. Exclude amino groups, which are already accounted for in Rule 3.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Update the SMARTS pattern: `c1ccc([C](=O)[O-])c([EDG])c1`, where `[EDG]` represents electron-donating groups.
    - Define `[EDG]` as `[OX2][CH3], [CH3], [CH2][CH3]`.

- **Advice 3**: **Improve Distance Calculations in Rules 5 and 8**

  - **Issue**: Current distance calculations may not accurately assess the proximity of functional groups to the carboxylic acid.
  - **Action**: Calculate the shortest path (in terms of bond count) between any atom in the carboxylic acid group and any atom in the functional group (amino, hydroxyl, or thiol). This provides a more accurate measure of functional group proximity.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit) to compute the shortest path between groups.
    - Update the code to identify all atoms in each functional group and compute distances accordingly.
    - Define proximity thresholds (e.g., within three bonds) to classify as proximal or distal.

- **Advice 4**: **Enhance Adjacency Checks in Rule 6**

  - **Issue**: Adjacency between the carboxylic acid and chelating groups may not be accurately captured.
  - **Action**: Ensure that the hydroxyl or carbonyl groups capable of chelation are directly bonded to the same carbon as the carboxylic acid group or are part of a conjugated system facilitating chelation.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Update SMARTS patterns to detect adjacent hydroxyl or carbonyl groups: `[$([C](=O)[O-]),$([C](O)[O-])]`.
    - Include checks for chelate ring formation potentials (e.g., five- or six-membered rings).

- **Advice 5**: **Specify Bulky Groups Explicitly in Rule 10**

  - **Issue**: Rule 10 currently only considers tert-butyl groups as sterically hindering.
  - **Action**: Expand the SMARTS patterns to include other bulky groups such as isopropyl (`C(C)C`), phenyl (`c1ccccc1`), and naphthyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate group.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Update the SMARTS pattern to detect bulky groups near the carboxylic acid: `[C](C)(C)C`, `[c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1`, etc.
    - Ensure these groups are adjacent by specifying proximity in the SMARTS pattern.

- **Advice 6**: **Correct Perfluorinated Chain Detection in Rule 11**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern may miss longer perfluorinated chains.
  - **Action**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to detect perfluorinated alkyl chains of variable lengths attached to the carboxylic acid.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use a recursive SMARTS pattern: `[C](F)(F)(F)[C](F)(F)[C](F)(F)`, allowing for chain length variability.
    - Implement a pattern that matches any perfluoroalkyl chain: `[CX4](F)(F)(F)-[CX2](F)-[CX2](F)...`.

- **Advice 7**: **Refine Identification of Polyether Chains in Rule 12**

  - **Issue**: The rule may not capture all variations of polyether chains.
  - **Action**: Use recursive SMARTS patterns to identify ethylene glycol repeats of different lengths attached to the carboxylic acid.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use SMARTS like `OCC(OCC)nO`, where `n >= 2`.
    - Implement recursive patterns to match multiple ethylene glycol units: `[OX2][CX4][CX4][OX2][CX4][CX4]...`.

- **Advice 8**: **Improve Chain Length Assessment in Rule 13**

  - **Issue**: Unbranched hydrocarbon chains may not be correctly identified as medium-length (6-8 carbons).
  - **Action**: Ensure the SMARTS pattern accurately identifies unbranched alkyl chains of the specified length directly attached to the carboxylic acid.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use SMARTS patterns like `[C][C][C][C][C][C][C](=O)[O-]` for a seven-carbon chain.
    - Adjust the pattern to match chains of 6-8 carbons: `[C]{$(CCCCCC),$(CCCCCCC),$(CCCCCCCC)}(=O)[O-]`.

- **Advice 9**: **Clarify Bulky Side Chains in Rule 14**

  - **Issue**: Other bulky side chains lacking coordinating groups may be overlooked.
  - **Action**: Update SMARTS patterns to include bulky aromatic systems like indole (`c1cc2c([nH]c2cc1)`) and naphthyl groups, ensuring they lack additional heteroatoms for coordination.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Include patterns for various bulky groups: `[CH2]-[c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1`, `[CH2]-c1cc2ccccc2[nH]1`.
    - Ensure these groups are connected via aliphatic chains to the carboxylic acid.

- **Advice 10**: **Ensure Correct Matching in Rule 15**

  - **Issue**: The rule may incorrectly match thiol and carboxylic acid groups that are not on the same ring.
  - **Action**: Update the SMARTS pattern to ensure both thiol and carboxylic acid groups are attached to the same aromatic ring system.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use SMARTS like `c1c([SH])ccc([C](=O)[O-])c1` to ensure both groups are on the same ring.
    - Include checks for ring membership in the pattern.

- **Advice 11**: **Use More Precise SMARTS Patterns Across All Rules**

  - **Issue**: Existing SMARTS patterns may not accurately represent functional groups due to aromaticity, resonance, or tautomerization.
  - **Action**: Review and update all SMARTS patterns to precisely define functional groups, taking into account aromaticity and potential resonance structures.
  - **Implementation**:
    - For aromatic rings, use lowercase `c` for carbons in SMARTS.
    - Include explicit hydrogen counts and charges where necessary.
    - Utilize advanced SMARTS features like atom maps for clarity.

- **Advice 12**: **Add Logging for Debugging**

  - **Issue**: Lack of detailed output makes debugging difficult.
  - **Action**: Implement logging in the rule application code to output information about which rules are activated for each molecule.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use a logging library or print statements to record rule matches.
    - Include molecule identifiers and matched substructures in the logs.

- **Advice 13**: **Validate Rules with Test Cases**

  - **Issue**: Rules may not perform as expected without proper validation.
  - **Action**: Create a set of test molecules with known outcomes to verify that each rule correctly identifies matches and non-matches.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Assemble a test dataset covering edge cases for each rule.
    - Apply rules to the test set and compare predictions with known outcomes.
    - Adjust rules based on discrepancies observed during testing.

- **Advice 14**: **Refactor Code for Clarity and Maintainability**

  - **Issue**: Code organization may hinder updates and maintenance.
  - **Action**: Separate rule definitions, SMARTS patterns, and processing logic into distinct sections or modules.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Define a data structure (e.g., a class or dictionary) to hold each rule's information.
    - Organize the code into functions or classes for rule application.
    - Document code thoroughly for future reference.

- **Advice 15**: **Consider Chemical Environment in Rules**

  - **Issue**: Some rules may not account for the broader chemical environment affecting reactivity.
  - **Action**: Incorporate context into rules by considering neighboring atoms or groups that may influence coordination or sterics.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Include additional SMARTS to detect activating or deactivating groups nearby.
    - Analyze the electronic and steric effects in the molecule holistically.

- **Advice 16**: **Review and Update Underperforming Rules**

  - **Issue**: Rules with low confidence or lift may not contribute positively.
  - **Action**: Reevaluate underperforming rules (e.g., Rule 4) to determine if they should be refined or removed.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Analyze the data to see if the rule captures a meaningful pattern.
    - If not, consider removing the rule to simplify the model.

- **Advice 17**: **Avoid Overlapping Rules**

  - **Issue**: Overlapping rules may cause conflicting predictions.
  - **Action**: Ensure that rules are mutually exclusive where possible or prioritize rules to resolve conflicts.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Assign priority levels to rules based on confidence and support.
    - Implement conflict resolution strategies in code.

** End of Advice **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
After analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical properties of the molecular modifiers, here are the refined rules that describe the relationship between the modifiers and the relative high or low yield of the reaction. These rules focus on combinations of functional groups and underlying physico-chemical properties to predict the yield outcome.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids containing both an amino group (-NH₂) and multiple carboxylic acid groups (-COOH)** within a short aliphatic chain result in a **high yield**. The presence of these groups facilitates strong bidentate or multidentate chelation with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)** groups, result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination through stronger ionic interactions.

   - Examples:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) at the para position** result in a **high yield**. The amino group can coordinate with the metal center, providing additional binding sites and stabilizing the catalyst.

   - Example:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms** and a **carboxylic acid group** result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms in the ring act as additional coordination sites with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal functional groups** (such as **amino (-NH₂)**, **hydroxyl (-OH)**, or **thiol (-SH)** groups) **within three carbons** of the carboxylic acid group result in a **high yield**. These groups enhance chelation through additional coordination sites.

   - Examples:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids** result in a **high yield**. The thiol group forms strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

   - Example:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **unsubstituted medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (carbon chain lengths of **6-8 carbons**) without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic alkyl chain may enhance interactions with the catalyst's organic framework.

   - Example:
     - **Octanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)**, **hydroxyl (-OH)**, or **methoxy (-OCH₃)** groups, result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

   - Examples:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxylic acid) result in a **low yield**. The distal position of the functional groups reduces effective chelation with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) groups conjugated to the ring** result in a **low yield**. These carbonyl groups can engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination with the metal.

    - Example:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **long polyether chains** attached to the carboxylic acid group result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance from bulky groups adjacent to the coordination site interferes with effective metal binding.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **peptides or amino acids with additional amide bonds** result in a **low yield**. Amide groups compete with carboxylate groups for metal coordination, reducing overall binding efficiency.

    - Example:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the ortho position** (relative to the carboxyl group) result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can reduce the availability of functional groups for metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider the physico-chemical properties that influence metal coordination and catalyst activity. They aim to predict the yield outcome based on structural features of the modifiers:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - Contain functional groups that enhance metal binding through chelation (e.g., proximal amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups).
  - Have electron-withdrawing groups that increase carboxylate acidity and coordination strength.
  - Feature heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms offering additional coordination sites.
  - Include medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without interfering functional groups, possibly enhancing hydrophobic interactions.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - Possess functional groups that decrease carboxylate acidity (electron-donating groups) or compete with carboxylate coordination (amide, distal functional groups).
  - Have bulky side chains causing steric hindrance.
  - Contain groups that may engage in side reactions or reduce availability for coordination (aldehydes, ketones, ortho-hydroxyls).
  - Feature structural elements that introduce flexibility and entropic penalties (long polyether chains).

These rules provide a framework to predict the yield outcome for new modifiers based on their structural features. By applying these rules, one can infer whether a given SMILES structure is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction.

Current rules:
After analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical properties of the molecular modifiers, here are the refined rules that describe the relationship between the modifiers and the relative high or low yield of the reaction. These rules focus on combinations of functional groups and underlying physico-chemical properties to predict the yield outcome.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids containing both an amino group (-NH₂) and multiple carboxylic acid groups (-COOH)** within a short aliphatic chain result in a **high yield**. The presence of these groups facilitates strong bidentate or multidentate chelation with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)** groups, result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination through stronger ionic interactions.

   - Examples:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) at the para position** result in a **high yield**. The amino group can coordinate with the metal center, providing additional binding sites and stabilizing the catalyst.

   - Example:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms** and a **carboxylic acid group** result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms in the ring act as additional coordination sites with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal functional groups** (such as **amino (-NH₂)**, **hydroxyl (-OH)**, or **thiol (-SH)** groups) **within three carbons** of the carboxylic acid group result in a **high yield**. These groups enhance chelation through additional coordination sites.

   - Examples:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids** result in a **high yield**. The thiol group forms strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

   - Example:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **unsubstituted medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (carbon chain lengths of **6-8 carbons**) without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic alkyl chain may enhance interactions with the catalyst's organic framework.

   - Example:
     - **Octanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)**, **hydroxyl (-OH)**, or **methoxy (-OCH₃)** groups, result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

   - Examples:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxylic acid) result in a **low yield**. The distal position of the functional groups reduces effective chelation with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) groups conjugated to the ring** result in a **low yield**. These carbonyl groups can engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination with the metal.

    - Example:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **long polyether chains** attached to the carboxylic acid group result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance from bulky groups adjacent to the coordination site interferes with effective metal binding.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **peptides or amino acids with additional amide bonds** result in a **low yield**. Amide groups compete with carboxylate groups for metal coordination, reducing overall binding efficiency.

    - Example:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the ortho position** (relative to the carboxyl group) result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can reduce the availability of functional groups for metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider the physico-chemical properties that influence metal coordination and catalyst activity. They aim to predict the yield outcome based on structural features of the modifiers:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - Contain functional groups that enhance metal binding through chelation (e.g., proximal amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups).
  - Have electron-withdrawing groups that increase carboxylate acidity and coordination strength.
  - Feature heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms offering additional coordination sites.
  - Include medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without interfering functional groups, possibly enhancing hydrophobic interactions.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - Possess functional groups that decrease carboxylate acidity (electron-donating groups) or compete with carboxylate coordination (amide, distal functional groups).
  - Have bulky side chains causing steric hindrance.
  - Contain groups that may engage in side reactions or reduce availability for coordination (aldehydes, ketones, ortho-hydroxyls).
  - Feature structural elements that introduce flexibility and entropic penalties (long polyether chains).

These rules provide a framework to predict the yield outcome for new modifiers based on their structural features. By applying these rules, one can infer whether a given SMILES structure is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**
- **Suggestion 1**: For **Rule 1**, the SMARTS pattern for 'multiple_carboxylic_acids' uses a dot `'.'` in `multiple_carboxylic_acids = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1].[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`, which represents disconnected fragments in SMARTS syntax. This means it will look for two separate molecules, each containing a carboxylic acid, rather than two carboxylic acid groups within the same molecule. To fix this, you can modify the pattern to search for two carboxylic acid groups within the same molecule. One way is to use a pattern that counts the occurrences of the carboxylic acid group, such as `[$([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])]`, and ensure it matches at least twice using a recursive SMARTS or by matching patterns that include two such groups connected via aliphatic chains. Alternatively, use `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]...'`, using wildcards or atom counts to bridge the two carboxylic acids in the same molecule.

- **Suggestion 2**: In **Rule 1**, the current SMARTS patterns for the amino group and the carboxylic acids do not ensure that they are part of the same short aliphatic chain, as specified in the natural language rule. To accurately capture the rule, the SMARTS pattern should enforce that the amino group and multiple carboxylic acid groups are connected through a short aliphatic chain (e.g., a chain of 2-5 carbons). You can modify the SMARTS pattern to `[*][CH2][CH(N)[CH2]][CH2][C](=O)O` to reflect an amino acid with an amino group and two carboxylic acids within a short chain.

- **Suggestion 3**: For **Rule 2**, the SMARTS pattern `para_electron_withdrawing_group = '[c][c](=[O,N])[c][c][c][c](=[O,N])[c]'` may not generalize well to all aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. It appears too specific and might miss valid matches. Instead, you could define a variable for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like `[NX3](=O)O`, `[CX3](=O)[OX1-]`, `[F,Cl,Br,I]`, etc., and include it in the pattern. For example, use `c1ccc(cc1)[C,W]:[c]c1ccccc1C(=O)O` where `[C,W]` represents the position of the EWG at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 4**: In **Rule 3**, the pattern `amino_group_para = 'c1ccc(cc1)N'` only checks for an amino group attached anywhere on the aromatic ring and does not specifically enforce that it's at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. To fix this, the SMARTS pattern should specify the relative positions. You can use a pattern like `c1cc(N)ccc1C(=O)O`, which ensures that the amino group is para to the carboxylic acid on the benzene ring.

- **Suggestion 5**: For **Rule 5**, the SMARTS pattern `proximal_functional_group = '[#6][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][#6][#6][OX2H,SH,NH2]'` may not correctly match modifiers containing aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal functional groups within three carbons of the carboxylic acid group. The pattern seems to enforce an exact connectivity rather than any functional group within three carbons. A better approach is to define a SMARTS pattern that captures any chain of up to three carbons connecting the carboxylic acid and the functional group, such as `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][#6]{0,2}[OX2H,SH,NH2]`.

- **Suggestion 6**: For rules involving positional isomerism on aromatic rings (e.g., para, ortho substitutions in **Rules 2**, **3**, **8**, **10**, and **15**), ensure that the SMARTS patterns explicitly define the positions of substituents relative to each other. Use ring templates and numbering in SMARTS to precisely specify the positions. For instance, for para substitutions, you can use `c1cc([Substituent1])ccc1[Substituent2]` with appropriate placement of the substituents.

- **Suggestion 7**: In **Rule 9**, the SMARTS pattern `distal_functional_group = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][#6][#6][#6][#6][OX2H,SH,NH2]'` might only match molecules where the functional group is exactly four carbons away from the carboxylic acid, rather than more than three carbons away as per the rule. To address this, modify the pattern to allow for functional groups located beyond three carbons, such as `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][#6]{3,}[OX2H,SH,NH2]`.

- **Suggestion 8**: For **Rule 10**, the SMARTS pattern `conjugated_carbonyl_aromatic = 'c1ccc(cc1)C=O'` may match any aromatic ring with an aldehyde group but does not ensure that the carbonyl group is conjugated to the ring and that the molecule also contains a carboxylic acid group, as specified in the rule. To fix this, combine this pattern with the carboxylic acid pattern and specify the positions appropriately, such as `c1cc([C]=O)ccc1C(=O)O`.

- **Suggestion 9**: In **Rule 14**, the SMARTS pattern `peptides_with_amide_bonds = '[CX3](=O)[NX3][#6][NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` may not accurately capture peptides or amino acids with additional amide bonds if they contain more complex structures or side chains. Consider expanding the pattern to accommodate amide bonds within peptide chains more generally, perhaps by using recursive SMARTS or matching repeating amide units.

- **Suggestion 10**: For better accuracy and maintainability, consider defining SMARTS patterns for common functional groups (e.g., electron-withdrawing groups, electron-donating groups, proximal/distal functional groups) separately and then incorporating them into the rule patterns using logical operators. This modular approach can help in updating and reusing SMARTS patterns across different rules.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Functional Groups and Structural Features**  
  To facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix, redefine the rules to be based on quantifiable counts of functional groups and structural elements present in the modifiers. For each modifier, calculate the number of specific functional groups (e.g., amino groups, carboxylic acids, hydroxyls, thiols) and structural features (e.g., aromatic rings, aliphatic chains, heteroatoms). This approach allows the rules to be easily translated into numerical data suitable for statistical analysis or machine learning models.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Molecular Descriptors and Physicochemical Properties**  
  Incorporate molecular descriptors and physicochemical properties that can be computed from the SMILES strings of the modifiers. Parameters such as molecular weight, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and counts of specific atom types can be included in the rules. These descriptors can capture the overall electronic and steric effects influencing the yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Implement Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR) Models**  
  Transition from qualitative rules to a quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling approach. Develop mathematical models that relate numerical molecular descriptors to the reaction yield. This method enables the prediction of yields based on computed properties and statistical correlations, providing a more precise and scalable framework for analyzing new modifiers.

- **Advice 4**: **Define Numerical Thresholds for Key Descriptors**  
  For each rule, establish numerical thresholds for relevant descriptors. For example, specify that modifiers with an electron-withdrawing parameter (e.g., Hammett sigma value) above a certain threshold result in high yield, while those below lead to low yield. Similarly, set cut-off values for counts of coordinating groups within a certain molecular distance from the carboxylate group.

- **Advice 5**: **Use Substructure Searches and Fingerprints**  
  Apply substructure searches or chemical fingerprints to identify the presence of specific structural motifs within the modifiers. Convert these motifs into binary features (1 if present, 0 if absent) to represent the modifiers numerically. Chemical fingerprints like MACCS keys or circular fingerprints (e.g., ECFP) can capture the structural information necessary for rule application.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Distance-Based Functional Group Relationships**  
  Quantify the positional relationships between functional groups and key moieties (e.g., distance between amino groups and carboxylic acids). Use cheminformatics tools to calculate intra-molecular distances or connectivity between atoms, allowing for rules that consider the proximity of functional groups in a quantifiable manner.

- **Advice 7**: **Standardize Modifier Structures for Consistent Feature Extraction**  
  Ensure that all SMILES strings are standardized (e.g., tautomers, ionization states) to maintain consistency in feature extraction. This standardization reduces variability due to different representations of the same chemical structure, enabling more reliable numerical analysis.

- **Advice 8**: **Develop a Hierarchical Rule Structure**  
  Organize the rules in a hierarchical manner, starting from general descriptors to more specific ones. This structure can help in systematically capturing the influence of different properties on the yield and simplifies the translation into a numerical framework by assigning weights or scores at each hierarchical level.

- **Advice 9**: **Integrate Electronic and Steric Parameters**  
  Calculate electronic parameters (e.g., partial charges, HOMO-LUMO gaps) and steric parameters (e.g., van der Waals volumes) for the modifiers. Incorporate these quantitative parameters into the rules to more accurately reflect the modifiers' influence on metal coordination and catalytic activity.

- **Advice 10**: **Employ Machine Learning Techniques for Rule Refinement**  
  Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and identify patterns that may not be apparent through manual rule generation. Techniques such as decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines can automatically generate rules based on numerical features extracted from the SMILES strings.

**End of Advice**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
After analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical properties of the molecular modifiers, here are refined rules that describe the relationship between the modifiers and the relative high or low yield of the reaction. These rules focus on combinations of functional groups and underlying physico-chemical properties to predict the yield outcome.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (five carbons or fewer) with an **amino group (-NH₂) or thiol group (-SH) within three carbons** of the carboxylic acid result in a **high yield**. These proximal functional groups enhance metal coordination through chelation.

   - Examples (**High Yield**):
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

   - Non-examples (**Low Yield**):
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **amino acids containing both an amino group (-NH₂) and additional carboxylic acid groups (-COOH)**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. Multiple acidic groups enhance coordination with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromoalkyl groups** at the **para position**, result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination.

   - Examples:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups**, such as an **amino group (-NH₂)** at the **para position**, result in a **high yield**. These groups provide additional sites for metal binding.

   - Example:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **medium to long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (six carbons or more) **without additional functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic alkyl chain may enhance interactions with the catalyst's framework.

   - Example:
     - **Octanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) that do not coordinate to metals**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)**, at the **para position** result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

   - Examples:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) groups conjugated to the ring** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or engage in side reactions.

   - Examples:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance reduces effective metal coordination.

   - Example:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without flexible linkers** result in a **low yield**. The rigid structure may limit effective coordination due to steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxylic acid) result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective for chelation.

    - Examples:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that contain **perfluoroalkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. Strong electron-withdrawing effects decrease the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

    - Example:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that contain **amide bonds or peptide linkages** result in a **low yield**. Amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for metal coordination, reducing binding efficiency.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long flexible polyether chains** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions enabling intramolecular hydrogen bonding** (e.g., **ortho** to the carboxyl group) result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of functional groups for metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider the physico-chemical properties that influence metal coordination and catalyst activity. They aim to predict the yield outcome based on structural features of the modifiers:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - Contain functional groups that enhance metal binding through chelation (e.g., proximal amino, thiol groups).
  - Have electron-withdrawing groups that increase carboxylate acidity and coordination strength.
  - Feature heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms offering additional coordination sites.
  - Include medium to long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without interfering functional groups, potentially enhancing hydrophobic interactions.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - Possess functional groups that decrease carboxylate basicity (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains) or compete with carboxylate coordination (amide bonds).
  - Have bulky or inflexible structures causing steric hindrance.
  - Contain functional groups positioned ineffectively for coordination (distal functional groups).
  - Feature electron-donating groups that do not coordinate with metals, weakening carboxylate coordination.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given SMILES structure is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction based on its structural features.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in its structural description, specifying short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group. It provides sufficient physico-chemical insight, explaining that proximal functional groups enhance metal coordination through chelation. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points, including **5-aminopentanoic acid** and **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (high yield), as well as non-examples like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (low yield), effectively meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly defines amino acids containing both an amino group and additional carboxylic acid groups as high-yield modifiers. The physico-chemical insight is adequate, explaining that multiple acidic groups enhance coordination with the metal center. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two data points: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**, both showing high yield, thus satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in high yield. The physico-chemical insight explains that EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination. The rule addresses combinations of functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two data points: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, both yielding high results.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with a coordinating amino group at the para position result in high yield. The physico-chemical insight is provided, explaining that such groups offer additional sites for metal binding. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. However, the coverage is limited to a single data point: **4-aminobenzoic acid**. Additional examples or data points would strengthen the rule's coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 specifies that medium to long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield, citing **octanoic acid** as an example. The rule is clear and provides physico-chemical insight, suggesting hydrophobic interactions enhance catalyst activity. The complexity is minimal but acceptable. Coverage is limited to one data point, so including more examples would improve the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position result in low yield. The physico-chemical insight is sound, explaining that EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two data points: **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, both associated with low yield.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in defining that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups conjugated to the ring result in low yield. The physico-chemical rationale is provided, attributing the effect to interference with metal coordination or side reactions. The rule considers specific combinations of functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage is sufficient, with at least two data points: **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, both yielding low results.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 specifies that amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance. The rule is clear and provides physico-chemical insight. The complexity is appropriate. However, coverage is limited to one supporting data point (**(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**), and there are exceptions (e.g., **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** shows high yield), indicating a need to refine the rule or consider exceptions.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly states that heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring result in high yield. The physico-chemical insight explains that nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites. The rule considers specific structural combinations, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by multiple data points, including **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, all showing high yield.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without flexible linkers result in low yield due to steric hindrance. The rule is clear and provides physico-chemical insight. Complexity is appropriate, but the coverage is limited to a single data point (**4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**). Including more examples would enhance the rule's validity.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups result in low yield. The physico-chemical rationale is provided, noting that distant functional groups are less effective for chelation. The rule meets the complexity criterion and is supported by multiple data points: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, and **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, all yielding low results.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 indicates that modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects decreasing carboxylate basicity. The rule is clear and provides physico-chemical insight. It considers specific structural features but is supported by only one data point (**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**). Additional data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly states that modifiers containing amide bonds or peptide linkages result in low yield due to competition for metal coordination. The physico-chemical insight is appropriate. The rule considers specific structural features, meeting complexity. It is supported by at least two data points: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, both resulting in low yield.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids with long flexible polyether chains result in low yield due to reduced coordination effectiveness. The rule is clear and provides physico-chemical insight. It meets the complexity criterion. Coverage includes two data points: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**, both showing low yield.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups enabling intramolecular hydrogen bonding result in low yield. The physico-chemical insight explains that intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces functional group availability for metal coordination. The rule meets the complexity criterion and is supported by at least two data points: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, both associated with low yield.

Current rules:
After analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical properties of the molecular modifiers, here are refined rules that describe the relationship between the modifiers and the relative high or low yield of the reaction. These rules focus on combinations of functional groups and underlying physico-chemical properties to predict the yield outcome.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (five carbons or fewer) with an **amino group (-NH₂) or thiol group (-SH) within three carbons** of the carboxylic acid result in a **high yield**. These proximal functional groups enhance metal coordination through chelation.

   - Examples (**High Yield**):
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

   - Non-examples (**Low Yield**):
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **amino acids containing both an amino group (-NH₂) and additional carboxylic acid groups (-COOH)**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. Multiple acidic groups enhance coordination with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromoalkyl groups** at the **para position**, result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination.

   - Examples:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups**, such as an **amino group (-NH₂)** at the **para position**, result in a **high yield**. These groups provide additional sites for metal binding.

   - Example:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **medium to long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (six carbons or more) **without additional functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic alkyl chain may enhance interactions with the catalyst's framework.

   - Example:
     - **Octanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) that do not coordinate to metals**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)**, at the **para position** result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

   - Examples:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) groups conjugated to the ring** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or engage in side reactions.

   - Examples:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance reduces effective metal coordination.

   - Example:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without flexible linkers** result in a **low yield**. The rigid structure may limit effective coordination due to steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxylic acid) result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective for chelation.

    - Examples:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that contain **perfluoroalkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. Strong electron-withdrawing effects decrease the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

    - Example:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that contain **amide bonds or peptide linkages** result in a **low yield**. Amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for metal coordination, reducing binding efficiency.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long flexible polyether chains** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions enabling intramolecular hydrogen bonding** (e.g., **ortho** to the carboxyl group) result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of functional groups for metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider the physico-chemical properties that influence metal coordination and catalyst activity. They aim to predict the yield outcome based on structural features of the modifiers:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - Contain functional groups that enhance metal binding through chelation (e.g., proximal amino, thiol groups).
  - Have electron-withdrawing groups that increase carboxylate acidity and coordination strength.
  - Feature heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms offering additional coordination sites.
  - Include medium to long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without interfering functional groups, potentially enhancing hydrophobic interactions.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - Possess functional groups that decrease carboxylate basicity (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains) or compete with carboxylate coordination (amide bonds).
  - Have bulky or inflexible structures causing steric hindrance.
  - Contain functional groups positioned ineffectively for coordination (distal functional groups).
  - Feature electron-donating groups that do not coordinate with metals, weakening carboxylate coordination.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given SMILES structure is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction based on its structural features.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: *Adjust Carbon Counting in Rule 1*: Modify the carbon counting in Rule 1 to exclude carbons in functional groups like carboxylic acids. Currently, the code counts all carbons, including those in carboxylic acid groups, which can incorrectly exclude molecules that should match the rule. Implement a method to count only the carbons in the aliphatic chain (the backbone), excluding those in functional groups.

- **Suggestion 2**: *Refine Amino and Thiol Group Detection in Rule 1*: Update the SMARTS patterns for the amino and thiol groups to account for implicit hydrogens. The current patterns (`[NX3H2]` for primary amines and `[SX2H]` for thiols) may not match groups where hydrogens are implicit in the SMILES notation. Use patterns like `[N;!$(N=*)]` for amines and `[S;X2;H1]` for thiols to ensure accurate detection.

- **Suggestion 3**: *Accurate Path Length Calculation in Rule 1*: When determining the proximity of amino or thiol groups to the carboxylic acid, ensure that the shortest path calculation considers only relevant atoms (exclude oxygen atoms of the carboxylic acid). Modify the path length calculation to measure the distance along the carbon chain, providing a true representation of proximity.

- **Suggestion 4**: *Improve Detection of Amino Acids with Multiple Carboxylic Acids in Rule 2*: Adjust the code to accurately detect amino acids like aspartic acid and glutamic acid, which have side-chain carboxylic acid groups. Enhance the SMARTS patterns to identify additional carboxylic acid groups attached to the side chains, not just the alpha-carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 5**: *Specific Positioning of Electron-Withdrawing Groups in Rule 3*: Refine the code to detect electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) specifically at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids. Currently, the code checks for EWGs anywhere on the ring. Use SMARTS patterns like `c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H1])cc1[N+](=O)[O-]` for nitro groups or `c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H1])cc1Br` for bromine at the para position.

- **Suggestion 6**: *Precise Detection of Para-Substituted Amino Groups in Rule 4*: Modify the code to detect amino groups specifically at the para position on aromatic rings. The current implementation may detect amino groups at any position. Implement SMARTS patterns such as `c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H1])cc1[NH2]` to match para-amino benzoic acid accurately.

- **Suggestion 7**: *Exclude Functional Groups in Carbon Counting for Rule 5*: Similar to Suggestion 1, adjust the carbon counting in Rule 5 to consider only the length of the aliphatic chain, excluding carbons in functional groups. This will correctly identify medium to long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups.

- **Suggestion 8**: *Broaden Detection of Bulky Hydrophobic Side Chains in Rule 8*: Expand the detection criteria for bulky hydrophobic side chains to include amino acids like leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Use SMARTS patterns that capture branching in side chains or specific alkyl groups, not just aromatic rings.

- **Suggestion 9**: *Accurate Distance Measurement for Distal Functional Groups in Rule 11*: Ensure that the code accurately measures the distance between the carboxylic acid group and other functional groups. Adjust the shortest path calculation to correctly identify functional groups located more than three carbons away, considering the entire molecular structure.

- **Suggestion 10**: *Handle Implicit Hydrogens in SMARTS Patterns*: Revise all SMARTS patterns to account for implicit hydrogens in SMILES strings. Use hydrogen count queries like `[!#1]` to match atoms regardless of whether hydrogens are implicit or explicit. This will improve the accuracy of functional group detection across all rules.

- **Suggestion 11**: *Test and Validate Patterns with Representative Molecules*: For each rule, test the SMARTS patterns against known examples and non-examples provided in the rules section. Validate that the code correctly identifies these molecules, adjusting the patterns as necessary to improve accuracy.

- **Suggestion 12**: *Improve Error Handling for Parsing Molecules*: Incorporate better error handling when parsing SMILES strings to ensure that all valid molecules are processed. This will prevent false negatives due to parsing issues.

- **Suggestion 13**: *Refine the Detection of Electron-Donating Groups in Rule 6*: Update the code to specifically detect electron-donating groups like methyl or methoxy groups at the para position. Use SMARTS patterns such as `c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H1])cc1[CH3]` and `c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H1])cc1OC` to accurately match these substituents.

- **Suggestion 14**: *Enhance Detection of Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding in Rule 15*: Modify the SMARTS patterns to detect hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxylic acid, enabling intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Use patterns like `c1c([OH])ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H1])c1` to match compounds like salicylic acid.

- **Suggestion 15**: *Standardize Molecule Preparation Before Analysis*: Prior to applying the rules, standardize molecules using a process like salt stripping, tautomer normalization, and aromaticity perception. This ensures consistent matching of SMARTS patterns and improves overall accuracy.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Performance Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

Upon reviewing the current rule metrics and comparing them with the reference metrics, we observe several key points, especially focusing on confidence and lift as per the instructions.

1. **Improvement in Average Confidence**:
   - **Previous Average Train Confidence**: Approximately **0.5874**.
   - **Current Average Train Confidence**: Approximately **0.6411**.
   - **Observation**: The average confidence has increased, indicating that the current rules are more accurate in predicting the high yield outcome when the rule conditions are met. This suggests that the rules are becoming more reliable.

2. **Increase in Average Lift**:
   - **Previous Average Train Lift**: Approximately **1.1304**.
   - **Current Average Train Lift**: Approximately **1.2871**.
   - **Observation**: An increase in average lift signifies that the predictive power of the rules relative to random chance has improved. A lift greater than 1 indicates a positive association between the rule conditions and the high yield outcome.

3. **Analysis of Individual Rules**:
   - **High-Performing Rules**:
     - Several rules exhibit **high confidence and lift values**, such as:
       - **Rule 1**: Confidence 0.7444, Lift 1.4997.
       - **Rule 3**: Confidence 0.7238, Lift 1.4661.
     - **Interpretation**: These rules are strong predictors of high yield when their conditions are met, providing valuable insights into the structural features promoting catalytic efficiency.
   - **Underperforming Rule**:
     - **Rule 4**: Confidence 0.4619, Lift 0.9120.
     - **Observation**: Rule 4 has a confidence below the average and a lift less than 1, indicating that the rule conditions do not significantly increase the probability of a high yield compared to random chance.
     - **Implication**: This rule may not be effectively capturing the structural features that contribute to a high yield and might be misclassifying low-yield modifiers as high-yield ones.

4. **Leverage Analysis**:
   - **Positive Leverage Values**:
     - Most rules have positive leverage, indicating a stronger association than expected by chance.
   - **Negative Leverage in Rule 4**:
     - **Rule 4** displays a negative leverage (-0.0039), suggesting a weaker association than expected by chance.
     - **Conclusion**: This further emphasizes the need to re-examine Rule 4.

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum Consideration**:
  - The consistent improvement in average confidence and lift across iterations suggests that we have not yet reached a local minimum. There is still room for enhancement, particularly by addressing the underperforming rules.
- **Sufficiency of Iterations**:
  - Given that some rules are underperforming, additional iterations focusing on refining these rules may lead to further improvements. Therefore, the current number of iterations might not be sufficient to achieve the optimal set of rules.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Refine Underperforming Rules**:
   - **Re-evaluate Rule 4**:
     - **Issue**: Rule 4 pertains to modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups, such as an amino group at the para position*.
     - **Action**: Investigate whether the position of the amino group or additional structural factors are affecting the outcome. Consider analyzing substituent effects (ortho, meta positions) or the presence of interfering functional groups.
     - **Alternative Approach**: Modify the rule to be more specific or general, depending on the findings. For example, if para-amino groups are not consistently leading to high yields, perhaps the rule should focus on ortho or meta positions, or include additional coordinating groups.

2. **Merge and Simplify Similar Rules**:
   - **Reduce Redundancy**:
     - Some rules may overlap in their conditions or predictions. Combining similar rules can increase support and improve the reliability of the predictions.
   - **Example**:
     - **Rules 2 and 8** both deal with amino acids but predict different outcomes.
     - **Action**: Analyze the specific structural differences and determine if a unified rule with clear distinctions can be formulated.

3. **Increase Rule Support**:
   - **Issue**: Some rules have low support, meaning they apply to a small portion of the data.
   - **Action**: Generalize the rules slightly to encompass more data points without sacrificing confidence.
   - **Benefit**: Higher support can lead to more stable and generalizable rules.

4. **Incorporate Additional Chemical Features**:
   - **Physico-Chemical Properties**:
     - Consider integrating properties such as **pKa values**, **steric parameters**, or **electron density** factors.
     - **Action**: Use quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis to identify additional relevant features.
   - **Potential Outcome**: This may uncover new patterns and improve rule accuracy.

5. **Validate with Test Metrics**:
   - **Issue**: Current metrics focus on training data without test data evaluation.
   - **Action**: Apply the rules to a validation set to assess their predictive performance on unseen data.
   - **Benefit**: Ensures that the rules generalize well and are not overfitting to the training data.

6. **Address Functional Group Interactions**:
   - **Complex Interactions**:
     - Some functional groups may have synergistic or antagonistic effects when present together.
   - **Action**: Analyze combinations of functional groups to create interaction terms in the rules.
   - **Example**: A modifier with both an electron-withdrawing group and a coordinating group may have a different effect than predicted by considering each group separately.

7. **Statistical Significance Testing**:
   - **Assess Rule Validity**:
     - Perform chi-squared tests or other statistical assessments to determine the significance of the associations captured by the rules.
   - **Action**: Retain rules that show statistically significant associations and reconsider or discard those that do not.

8. **Feedback from Domain Experts**:
   - **Chemical Insight**:
     - Consult with chemists to interpret ambiguous results or to understand unexpected outcomes.
   - **Action**: Use expert knowledge to adjust rules in line with established chemical principles.

**Conclusion**

The current rules show improved performance over previous iterations, with higher average confidence and lift values indicating better predictive capability. However, the presence of underperforming rules like Rule 4 suggests that further refinement is necessary. By focusing on improving these rules, increasing support, and incorporating additional chemical insights, we can enhance the overall effectiveness of the rule set. Continuing iterations with these considerations in mind should bring us closer to an optimal solution, minimizing the likelihood of being trapped in a local minimum.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Accuracy Metrics Comparison**

The latest classification model yielded a validation accuracy of **71.43%** (0.7143). Comparing this to previous iterations:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies:**
  - [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - [0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625
  - [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625

The consistent validation accuracy of **76%** in previous iterations suggests that the current model's performance has slightly decreased by approximately **4.57%** in validation accuracy.

**2. Effectiveness of Current Rules**

- The slight decrease in validation accuracy indicates that while the current rules capture some underlying patterns in the data, they may not be fully effective in generalizing across all samples.
- The model's ability to predict the catalyst loading correctly has not improved with the current set of rules, suggesting potential limitations in the rule definitions.

**3. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Underfitting Evidence:**
  - The decrease in accuracy could indicate underfitting, where the model is too simple to capture the underlying data structure.
  - The lack of improvement despite introducing new rules suggests the model might not be complex enough or the rules are not capturing essential features.

- **Overfitting Evidence:**
  - If certain rules are too specific or only apply to training data, the model may overfit, failing to generalize to the validation set.
  - Consistent high accuracy in training but not in validation would support this, but additional training accuracy data is needed for confirmation.

**4. Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

To identify problematic rules, we examine molecules with discrepancies between predicted and experimental values and analyze their associated SHAP values.

**a. Molecules with Overestimated Loading (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

1. **Molecule:** C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
   - **Predicted Loading:** High
   - **Experimental Value:** Low
   - **SHAP Contributions:**
     - **Rule 7** SHAP value: **0.04585**
     - **Rule 12** SHAP value: **0.03445**
     - **Rule 13** SHAP value: **0.05606**

2. **Molecule:** C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN
   - **Predicted Loading:** High
   - **Experimental Value:** Low
   - **SHAP Contributions:**
     - **Rule 7** SHAP value: **0.04585**
     - **Rule 12** SHAP value: **0.03445**
     - **Rule 13** SHAP value: **0.05606**

**Inference:**

- **Rules 7, 12, and 13** contribute significantly to the overestimation.
- Positive SHAP values indicate these rules are pushing the prediction towards a high loading when the actual loading is low.

**b. Molecules with Underestimated Loading (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

1. **Molecule:** C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N
   - **Predicted Loading:** Low
   - **Experimental Value:** High
   - **SHAP Contributions:**
     - **Rule 7** SHAP value: **0.04585**
     - **Rule 12** SHAP value: **0.03445**
     - **Rule 13** SHAP value: **0.05606**

**Inference:**

- Despite positive contributions from Rules 7, 12, and 13, the model predicts a low loading.
- Other rules or model biases might be overpowering the positive SHAP contributions, leading to an underestimation.

**5. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

- The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current iteration of rules did not improve model performance.
- The accuracy seems to have plateaued or slightly declined, indicating a potential local minimum.
- The model may benefit from further refinement or reevaluation of the existing rules.

**6. Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rules 7, 12, and 13** are associated with significant positive SHAP values in mispredicted cases.
- These rules may be too broadly defined or incorrectly assigning high loading predictions to certain molecular features.
- Conversely, in molecules where the loading is underestimated, other rules might be overshadowing the contributions of Rules 7, 12, and 13.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values in Overestimations**

- **Rule 7 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Aldehyde Groups):**
  - **Issue:** This rule consistently contributes to overestimations.
  - **Action:** Reevaluate the rule's scope. Consider adding specificity regarding the position of the aldehyde group or additional structural constraints.
  - **Modification Suggestion:**
    - Limit the rule to exclude molecules where the aldehyde group is prone to side reactions or is sterically hindered.

- **Rule 12 (Modifiers with Perfluoroalkyl Chains):**
  - **Issue:** Positive SHAP contributions in overestimated loadings suggest the rule might incorrectly predict high yield.
  - **Action:** Adjust the rule to account for chain length or the influence of perfluoroalkyl chain position.
  - **Modification Suggestion:**
    - Specify that only short perfluoroalkyl chains contribute to low yield, or introduce thresholds for electron-withdrawing effects based on chain length.

- **Rule 13 (Modifiers with Amide Bonds or Peptide Linkages):**
  - **Issue:** The rule may be too general, leading to overprediction of high yield in molecules with amide bonds.
  - **Action:** Refine the rule to distinguish between different types of amide-containing structures.
  - **Modification Suggestion:**
    - Differentiate between primary amides directly connected to the carboxylic acid and more complex peptide linkages.
    - Consider the position and accessibility of amide groups for metal coordination.

**2. Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations**

- Identify rules that consistently contribute negative SHAP values in cases where the experimental loading is high but predicted as low.

- **Possible Actions:**
  - Investigate whether certain rules are too restrictive or exclude features that should contribute to high yield.
  - Relax conditions in these rules or broaden their applicability.

**3. Improve Generalization to Address Overfitting or Underfitting**

- **Overfitting Mitigation:**
  - Simplify overly complex rules that may only fit specific training data.
  - Remove redundant or overlapping rules.

- **Underfitting Mitigation:**
  - Introduce new rules capturing missing features influencing the yield.
  - Incorporate domain knowledge about catalyst-modifier interactions not currently represented.

**4. Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors**

- Beyond functional groups, consider including molecular descriptors such as:
  - **Steric Factors:** Bulkiness, branching, or steric hindrance near coordination sites.
  - **Electronic Factors:** Overall electron density, distribution, and resonance effects.
  - **Hydrophobicity/Hydrophilicity:** Influence on catalyst binding and reaction environment.

**5. Utilize SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement**

- Use SHAP value patterns to identify which molecular features are consistently mispredicted.

- **For Overestimated Loadings:**
  - Examine molecules where positive SHAP values from certain rules lead to incorrect high predictions.
  - Adjust these rules to reduce their contribution or make them more specific.

- **For Underestimated Loadings:**
  - Identify if certain rules have unintended negative contributions.
  - Modify these rules to prevent them from incorrectly lowering the predicted loading.

**6. Validate Adjusted Rules with Cross-Validation**

- After refining the rules, perform cross-validation to assess the improvements in accuracy.
- Monitor both training and validation accuracies to ensure that generalization has improved.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules partially captures the relationship between molecular features and catalyst loading but requires refinement. By:

- **Adjusting specific rules (e.g., Rules 7, 12, and 13) to reduce overestimations.**
- **Identifying and modifying rules contributing to underestimations.**
- **Improving the generalization capability of the model.**
- **Incorporating insights from SHAP analysis for iterative enhancement.**

We can enhance the predictive power of the model and move closer to accurately predicting catalyst loading based on molecular structures.

---

**Next Steps**

1. **Implement Rule Modifications:**
   - Apply the suggested changes to Rules 7, 12, and 13.
   - Reassess the definitions and scopes of other rules based on SHAP contributions.

2. **Re-Evaluate Model Performance:**
   - Retrain the model with the updated rules.
   - Compare the new accuracy metrics against previous iterations.

3. **Continuous Iteration:**
   - Repeat the analysis, focusing on new discrepancies that arise.
   - Use SHAP analysis to guide further refinements.

By systematically refining the rules and leveraging SHAP insights, we can improve the model's accuracy and its ability to generalize, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of the catalyst design process.

**Summary and Directions for Optimizing the Current Rules**

**Summary of Discussions:**

The current set of rules aims to predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the catalytic reaction. Analysis of the rule metrics and model performance indicates that while some rules are effective, others are underperforming or may be causing mispredictions.

Notable observations include:

- **Rule Performance Variability:** Some rules, such as Rule 1 and Rule 3, show high confidence and lift values, indicating strong predictive power. Conversely, Rule 4 exhibits low confidence and lift, suggesting it may not be effectively capturing the desired features.

- **Model Accuracy Fluctuations:** There has been a slight decrease in validation accuracy compared to previous iterations, potentially indicating issues with underfitting or overfitting.

- **SHAP Analysis Insights:** Certain rules contribute significantly to mispredictions. For example, Rules 7, 12, and 13 have high SHAP values in cases where the model overestimates the yield, suggesting these rules may be overly broad or need refinement.

**Directions to Optimize the Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Underperforming Rules:**

   - **Rule 4 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Coordinating Groups):**
     - **Issue:** Low confidence and lift values, potential misclassification.
     - **Suggestion:** Reevaluate the positioning of the amino group and consider the impact of other substituents on the aromatic ring. Modify the rule to include additional structural constraints or focus on positions that consistently lead to high yield.

2. **Adjust Rules Contributing to Mispredictions:**

   - **Rule 7 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Aldehyde Groups):**
     - **Issue:** Overestimation of yield due to broad rule definition.
     - **Suggestion:** Specify the positions of aldehyde groups that interfere with metal coordination. Exclude cases where aldehyde groups are involved in side reactions or sterically hinder coordination sites.

   - **Rule 12 (Modifiers with Perfluoroalkyl Chains):**
     - **Issue:** Positive SHAP contributions in overestimated cases.
     - **Suggestion:** Refine the rule to account for chain length and positioning of perfluoroalkyl groups. Emphasize the electron-withdrawing effects that significantly impact metal coordination.

   - **Rule 13 (Modifiers with Amide Bonds or Peptide Linkages):**
     - **Issue:** Generalization leading to overprediction of high yield.
     - **Suggestion:** Differentiate between simple amide-containing molecules and complex peptides. Consider the accessibility of the amide group for metal interaction and adjust the rule accordingly.

3. **Enhance Specificity in SMARTS Patterns:**

   - **Functional Group Detection:** Improve the accuracy of functional group detection by refining SMARTS patterns to account for implicit hydrogens and correct atom types.

   - **Position-Specific Substituents:** Modify patterns to detect substituents at specific positions (e.g., para, ortho) on aromatic rings, ensuring rules correctly identify molecules with expected behaviors.

4. **Revise Carbon Counting Methods:**

   - In rules where chain length is critical (e.g., Rules 1 and 5), adjust the carbon counting to exclude carbons in functional groups like carboxylic acids. Focus on the aliphatic backbone to accurately categorize chain lengths.

5. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors:**

   - **Steric Factors:** Include considerations of steric hindrance that may affect metal coordination.

   - **Electronic Effects:** Account for the influence of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the acidity/basicity of coordinating groups.

6. **Validate and Test Updated Rules:**

   - Apply the refined rules to both training and validation datasets to assess improvements in predictive performance.

   - Use representative molecules to test the accuracy of SMARTS patterns and ensure rules are correctly identifying high and low yield modifiers.

7. **Address Potential Overfitting or Underfitting:**

   - **Overfitting Mitigation:** Simplify overly complex rules and remove redundant conditions.

   - **Underfitting Mitigation:** Introduce new rules to capture missing patterns and improve the model's ability to generalize.

8. **Consult Domain Expertise:**

   - Engage with chemists or domain experts to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules and incorporate insights that may not be evident from data analysis alone.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without risking overfitting. By refining underperforming rules, adjusting the scope of rules contributing to mispredictions, and improving the specificity of SMARTS patterns, the model's predictive accuracy can be enhanced. Additionally, incorporating domain expertise and testing the rules on validation datasets can help ensure that the rules generalize well and do not merely fit the training data.

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    After analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical properties of the molecular modifiers, here are refined rules that describe the relationship between the modifiers and the relative high or low yield of the reaction. These rules focus on combinations of functional groups and underlying physico-chemical properties to predict the yield outcome.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (five carbons or fewer) with an **amino group (-NH₂) or thiol group (-SH) within three carbons** of the carboxylic acid result in a **high yield**. These proximal functional groups enhance metal coordination through chelation.

   - Examples (**High Yield**):
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

   - Non-examples (**Low Yield**):
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **amino acids containing both an amino group (-NH₂) and additional carboxylic acid groups (-COOH)**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. Multiple acidic groups enhance coordination with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromoalkyl groups** at the **para position**, result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination.

   - Examples:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups**, such as an **amino group (-NH₂)** at the **para position**, result in a **high yield**. These groups provide additional sites for metal binding.

   - Example:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **medium to long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (six carbons or more) **without additional functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic alkyl chain may enhance interactions with the catalyst's framework.

   - Example:
     - **Octanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) that do not coordinate to metals**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)**, at the **para position** result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

   - Examples:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) groups conjugated to the ring** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or engage in side reactions.

   - Examples:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance reduces effective metal coordination.

   - Example:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without flexible linkers** result in a **low yield**. The rigid structure may limit effective coordination due to steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxylic acid) result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective for chelation.

    - Examples:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that contain **perfluoroalkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. Strong electron-withdrawing effects decrease the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

    - Example:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that contain **amide bonds or peptide linkages** result in a **low yield**. Amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for metal coordination, reducing binding efficiency.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long flexible polyether chains** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions enabling intramolecular hydrogen bonding** (e.g., **ortho** to the carboxyl group) result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of functional groups for metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider the physico-chemical properties that influence metal coordination and catalyst activity. They aim to predict the yield outcome based on structural features of the modifiers:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - Contain functional groups that enhance metal binding through chelation (e.g., proximal amino, thiol groups).
  - Have electron-withdrawing groups that increase carboxylate acidity and coordination strength.
  - Feature heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms offering additional coordination sites.
  - Include medium to long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without interfering functional groups, potentially enhancing hydrophobic interactions.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - Possess functional groups that decrease carboxylate basicity (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains) or compete with carboxylate coordination (amide bonds).
  - Have bulky or inflexible structures causing steric hindrance.
  - Contain functional groups positioned ineffectively for coordination (distal functional groups).
  - Feature electron-donating groups that do not coordinate with metals, weakening carboxylate coordination.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given SMILES structure is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction based on its structural features.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 4** to improve its predictive performance. Specifically, adjust the rule to focus on aromatic carboxylic acids where the coordinating amino group (-NH₂) is at positions that are more effective for metal coordination, such as the **ortho** position relative to the carboxylic acid group. Consider excluding cases where additional substituents on the aromatic ring may hinder coordination. **Update the SMARTS pattern** to accurately detect amino groups at these specific positions and include necessary structural constraints to capture modifiers that consistently result in high yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Modify Rule 7** to increase its specificity regarding the positions of aldehyde groups. Specify that only modifiers with aldehyde (-CHO) groups at positions that directly interfere with metal coordination, such as the **ortho** position to the carboxylic acid, result in a low yield. Exclude modifiers where the aldehyde group is at positions less likely to hinder coordination or cause side reactions. **Update the SMARTS pattern** to detect aldehyde groups at these specific positions.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rule 12** to account for the chain length and positioning of perfluoroalkyl chains. Emphasize that modifiers with **long perfluoroalkyl chains (three or more fluorinated carbons)** directly attached to the carboxylic acid result in a low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects. Modifiers with shorter chains or perfluoroalkyl groups not adjacent to the carboxyl group may not have the same effect. **Adjust the SMARTS pattern** to detect perfluoroalkyl groups of specified lengths and positions.

- **Advice 4**: **Adjust Rule 13** to differentiate between simple amide-containing modifiers and complex peptides. Focus the rule on modifiers where the **amide bond is directly adjacent to the carboxylic acid group**, potentially competing with carboxylate groups for metal coordination. Exclude modifiers where amide groups are part of side chains or are too distant to significantly impact coordination. **Update the SMARTS pattern** to reflect these specifics.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance specificity in SMARTS patterns** for detecting functional groups and their positions. For example, in rules concerning aromatic rings, ensure that substituents are specified at exact positions (e.g., ortho, meta, para) relative to the carboxylic acid. This applies to **Rules 3, 4, 6, and 15**. Accurate positional detection will improve rule effectiveness in predicting yield outcomes.

- **Advice 6**: **Revise carbon counting methods** in rules where chain length is critical, such as **Rules 1 and 5**. Exclude carbons that are part of functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acid carbon) from the chain length count. Focus on the aliphatic backbone to accurately categorize modifiers as short or long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids. **Adjust the SMARTS patterns** accordingly to reflect the correct carbon count.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate steric and electronic effects** into relevant rules. For modifiers with bulky substituents that may cause steric hindrance (**Rule 8**), ensure the rule accounts for the size and flexibility of side chains. For rules involving electron-donating or withdrawing groups (**Rules 3 and 6**), emphasize how these groups influence the acidity/basicity of the carboxylate and its ability to coordinate with metals. **Update SMARTS patterns** to capture these electronic characteristics.

- **Advice 8**: **Validate and test updated rules** on both the training and a separate validation dataset. Use representative molecules to test the accuracy of SMARTS patterns and ensure that the refined rules correctly identify high and low yield modifiers. Adjust the rules based on validation performance to improve predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 9**: **Mitigate overfitting** by simplifying overly complex rules and removing redundant conditions. For instance, if a rule combines multiple functional groups and conditions, consider splitting it into separate rules that are more focused. This will help the model generalize better to new data.

- **Advice 10**: **Introduce new rules** to capture patterns not currently addressed. Analyze misclassified modifiers to identify common features or structural motifs that could form the basis of new rules. Incorporate these rules to improve the model's ability to predict outcomes for a broader range of modifiers.

- **Advice 11**: **Consult domain experts** to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules. Chemists can provide insights into coordination chemistry and reaction mechanisms that may not be apparent from data analysis alone. Their expertise can guide the refinement of rules to ensure they are both scientifically sound and predictive.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) or thiol group (-SH) within three carbons of the carboxylic acid** result in a **high yield**. The proximity of these functional groups to the carboxyl group allows for effective chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromo (-Br)** at the **para position** result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (contains an electron-donating group)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, strengthening interaction with the metal center.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (sterically hindered biphenyl structure)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) at the para position** result in a **high yield**. The amino group provides additional coordination capability with the metal center.

   - **Example**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, amino group is not directly attached to the ring)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (chains of **six to eight carbons**) **without additional interfering functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic alkyl chains may enhance interactions within the catalyst framework.

   - **Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **Perfluorinated acids** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) like methyl (-CH₃) or methoxy (-OCH₃) at the para position**, without additional coordinating groups, result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
     - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Exceptionally, this modifier shows high yield due to the presence of a ketone group that can coordinate with the metal)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) or formyl groups conjugated to the ring** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or undergo side reactions.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that contain **perfluoroalkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal.

   - **Example (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **amide bonds or peptide linkages** near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. Amide groups can act as competing ligands, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination by the carboxylate.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long flexible polyether chains** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains hinder effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without flexible linkers** result in a **low yield**. The rigid, bulky structure may cause steric hindrance, limiting effective metal coordination.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that have **functional groups capable of chelation (e.g., ketone, hydroxyl, thiol groups) within conjugated systems** result in a **high yield**. These groups enhance metal binding through multiple coordination sites.

    - **Examples (High Yield)**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (hydroxyl group involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing coordination)

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxylic acid) result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in participating in chelation.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that contain **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** due to **ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups** in aromatic carboxylic acids result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of these groups for metal coordination.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance from the bulky side chains reduces effective metal coordination.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

**End of Rules**

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider the underlying physico-chemical properties that influence metal coordination and catalyst activity:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - Feature functional groups (amino, thiol, ketone) proximal to the carboxyl group for effective chelation.
  - Contain electron-withdrawing groups that enhance carboxylate acidity and coordination strength.
  - Include heterocyclic rings with nitrogen atoms providing additional coordination sites.
  - Have medium-length aliphatic chains without interfering functional groups, potentially enhancing hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - Possess functional groups that decrease carboxylate basicity (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains) or compete with carboxylate coordination (amide bonds).
  - Contain electron-donating groups that weaken metal coordination.
  - Have bulky or inflexible structures causing steric hindrance.
  - Feature distal functional groups ineffective for chelation.
  - Include intramolecular hydrogen bonding that reduces availability of coordinating groups.

By applying these rules, we can predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset and balance simplicity with complexity to capture the key factors affecting the reaction yield.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) or thiol group (-SH) within three carbons of the carboxylic acid** result in a **high yield**. The proximity of these functional groups to the carboxyl group allows for effective chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromo (-Br)** at the **para position** result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (contains an electron-donating group)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, strengthening interaction with the metal center.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (sterically hindered biphenyl structure)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) at the para position** result in a **high yield**. The amino group provides additional coordination capability with the metal center.

   - **Example**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, amino group is not directly attached to the ring)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (chains of **six to eight carbons**) **without additional interfering functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic alkyl chains may enhance interactions within the catalyst framework.

   - **Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **Perfluorinated acids** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) like methyl (-CH₃) or methoxy (-OCH₃) at the para position**, without additional coordinating groups, result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
     - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Exceptionally, this modifier shows high yield due to the presence of a ketone group that can coordinate with the metal)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) or formyl groups conjugated to the ring** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or undergo side reactions.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that contain **perfluoroalkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal.

   - **Example (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **amide bonds or peptide linkages** near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. Amide groups can act as competing ligands, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination by the carboxylate.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long flexible polyether chains** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains hinder effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without flexible linkers** result in a **low yield**. The rigid, bulky structure may cause steric hindrance, limiting effective metal coordination.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that have **functional groups capable of chelation (e.g., ketone, hydroxyl, thiol groups) within conjugated systems** result in a **high yield**. These groups enhance metal binding through multiple coordination sites.

    - **Examples (High Yield)**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (hydroxyl group involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing coordination)

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxylic acid) result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in participating in chelation.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that contain **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** due to **ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups** in aromatic carboxylic acids result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of these groups for metal coordination.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance from the bulky side chains reduces effective metal coordination.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

**End of Rules**

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider the underlying physico-chemical properties that influence metal coordination and catalyst activity:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - Feature functional groups (amino, thiol, ketone) proximal to the carboxyl group for effective chelation.
  - Contain electron-withdrawing groups that enhance carboxylate acidity and coordination strength.
  - Include heterocyclic rings with nitrogen atoms providing additional coordination sites.
  - Have medium-length aliphatic chains without interfering functional groups, potentially enhancing hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - Possess functional groups that decrease carboxylate basicity (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains) or compete with carboxylate coordination (amide bonds).
  - Contain electron-donating groups that weaken metal coordination.
  - Have bulky or inflexible structures causing steric hindrance.
  - Feature distal functional groups ineffective for chelation.
  - Include intramolecular hydrogen bonding that reduces availability of coordinating groups.

By applying these rules, we can predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset and balance simplicity with complexity to capture the key factors affecting the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: Correct the SMARTS pattern for aliphatic carboxylic acids in **Rule 1**. The current pattern `'[CX3H0](=O)[OX2H1][C;!R]'` may not accurately identify aliphatic carboxylic acids. Replace it with a more general pattern that captures carboxylic acids attached to aliphatic chains: `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`. This pattern accounts for both carboxylate ions and carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 2**: Update the distance calculation logic in **Rule 1**'s additional check `'amino_thiol_within_3_carbons'`. Ensure that the distance matrix reflects the shortest path through bonds (topological distance) between the carboxyl carbon and the nitrogen/sulfur atoms of amino and thiol groups. Use atom indices from substructure matches correctly, and verify that functional groups within three bonds of the carboxyl group are identified.

- **Suggestion 3**: Refine the SMARTS patterns for **Rule 2** to accurately match aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. The current patterns are too simplified. Use patterns like:
  - Nitro group at para position: `'[cH]1ccc([NX3+(=O)[O-]])cc1C(=O)[O,H]'`
  - Bromo group at para position: `'[cH]1ccc(Br)cc1C(=O)[O,H]'`
  Ensure that the patterns specifically match the para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 4**: Improve the SMARTS pattern for heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in **Rule 3**. The pattern `'[n][c][c](=O)[O]'` is insufficient. Use a more general pattern like `'[nX2]:[c]:[c]:[c]:[c]:[c]C(=O)[O,H]'` to match pyridine carboxylic acids and other nitrogen-containing heterocycles with carboxylic acid groups.

- **Suggestion 5**: Modify **Rule 4**'s SMARTS pattern to detect aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the para position accurately. Use a pattern such as `'[cH]1ccc([NH2])cc1C(=O)[O,H]'` to match molecules like 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Suggestion 6**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern for medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids in **Rule 5**. The current pattern `'[CX3H2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH3]'` only matches specific chain lengths. Use a pattern with repetition to match chains of six to eight carbons:
  - `'C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2]{4,6}[CH3]'`
  This pattern captures aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths from five to seven carbons (excluding the carboxyl carbon), resulting in chains of six to eight carbons in total.

- **Suggestion 7**: For **Rule 6**, enhance the SMARTS patterns for electron-donating groups at the para position. Use specific patterns like:
  - Methyl group at para position: `'[cH]1ccc(C)cc1C(=O)[O,H]'`
  - Methoxy group at para position: `'[cH]1ccc(OC)cc1C(=O)[O,H]'`
  This ensures accurate matching of EDGs on aromatic carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 8**: Revise the code logic to handle multiple SMARTS patterns within a rule correctly. For rules where multiple patterns represent alternative substructures (logical OR), ensure that a match to any pattern suffices. For rules requiring multiple substructures (logical AND), ensure that all patterns must match simultaneously.

- **Suggestion 9**: Validate and correct the additional checks in **Rules 1** and **13**. For functional group proximity in **Rule 1**, verify that the code correctly identifies amino or thiol groups within three bonds from the carboxyl carbon. In **Rule 13**, ensure that distal functional groups are correctly identified by checking for distances greater than three bonds.

- **Suggestion 10**: Utilize RDKit's `Chem.Fragments` and predefined functional group detection functions where possible. For example, use `Chem.Fragments.fr_carboxylic_acid()` to identify carboxylic acids, which may improve accuracy and reduce the need for complex SMARTS patterns.

- **Suggestion 11**: Add error handling and comprehensive logging to the code. Implement try-except blocks around critical sections, and log informative messages that indicate which SMILES strings or rules caused issues. This will aid in debugging and refining the code.

- **Suggestion 12**: For **Rule 12**, broaden the SMARTS patterns to capture functional groups capable of chelation within conjugated systems more effectively. Create separate patterns for ketones, hydroxyls, and thiols adjacent to conjugated systems, such as:
  - Ketone adjacent to an aromatic ring: `'[c][C](=O)[c]'`
  - Hydroxyl within a conjugated system: `'[c][C](=C[OH])[c]'`
  - Thiol within a conjugated system: `'[c][C](=C[S])[c]'`

- **Suggestion 13**: Implement unit tests using the provided examples and non-examples for each rule. Test the updated patterns and logic to ensure that positive examples match the rules (resulting in 1 or -1 as appropriate) and non-examples do not.

- **Suggestion 14**: Clearly comment the code to explain the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and any complex logic used in additional checks. This improves code readability and maintainability.

- **Suggestion 15**: After making the above changes, regenerate the feature matrix and cross-check it against the expected outcomes based on the rules and examples provided. Ensure that the matrix entries now correctly reflect the application of rules to each SMILES string.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify Rules Using Descriptors**

  Revise the rules to focus on quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly extracted from SMILES representations. Identify key functional groups and structural features that influence yield, and express them in terms of counts or binary indicators. For example:

  - Count of amino groups within three bonds of the carboxyl group.
  - Presence or absence of electron-withdrawing groups at specific positions.
  - Number of nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules into Generalizable Categories**

  Merge similar rules to reduce redundancy and create broader categories that capture the essential features affecting yield. For instance:

  - Combine Rules 1, 12, and 13 into a general rule about modifiers with proximal chelating functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol, ketone) near the carboxyl group enhancing yield.
  - Group Rules 2 and 6 to address the impact of electron-withdrawing versus electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids.

- **Advice 3**: **Develop a Numerical Feature Matrix Based on Structural Features**

  Create a feature matrix where each modifier is characterized by numerical values representing structural and physicochemical properties. Potential features include:

  - **Functional Group Counts**: Number of amino groups, thiol groups, hydroxyl groups, etc.
  - **Distance Metrics**: Number of atoms between functional groups (e.g., amino group and carboxyl group).
  - **Electronic Descriptors**: Sum of Hammett sigma constants for substituents.
  - **Steric Descriptors**: Molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), molar refractivity.

- **Advice 4**: **Utilize Cheminformatics Tools for Descriptor Calculation**

  Employ cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit, ChemAxon) to automatically compute molecular descriptors from SMILES strings. This ensures consistency and scalability when processing multiple modifiers.

- **Advice 5**: **Implement a Binary Encoding Scheme for Key Functional Groups**

  Assign binary variables indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of specific functional groups or substructures critical to yield outcomes. Examples:

  - **AminoProximal**: 1 if an amino group is within three carbons of the carboxyl group; else 0.
  - **AromaticEWG**: 1 if an electron-withdrawing group is at the para position of an aromatic ring; else 0.
  - **HeterocyclicNitrogen**: 1 if the modifier contains a nitrogen-containing heterocycle; else 0.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Molecular Fingerprints for Structural Similarity**

  Use molecular fingerprints (e.g., ECFP, MACCS keys) to capture the presence of various substructures and functional groups. These fingerprints can be converted into numerical vectors suitable for machine learning models.

- **Advice 7**: **Reframe Rules to Emphasize Readily Computable Properties**

  Adjust the rules to focus on properties that are straightforward to compute, such as logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), hydrogen bond donor/acceptor counts, and rotatable bond counts. This facilitates quick assessment and reduces complexity.

- **Advice 8**: **Eliminate Redundant and Less Impactful Rules**

  Review the existing rules to identify and remove those that have minimal influence on yield or overlap significantly with other rules. Streamlining the rule set enhances clarity and usability.

- **Advice 9**: **Introduce Quantitative Thresholds Where Applicable**

  Where possible, define numerical thresholds for features that distinguish between high and low yields. For example:

  - High yield if the modifier has a Hammett sigma value greater than a certain threshold.
  - Low yield if the number of rotatable bonds exceeds a specific limit.

- **Advice 10**: **Consider Machine Learning Models for Pattern Recognition**

  Use supervised machine learning algorithms to discover patterns and relationships in the data that may not be apparent from manual rule creation. Algorithms like decision trees or random forests can identify the most significant features influencing yield.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) or hydroxyl group (-OH) at the para position** result in a **high yield**. These groups provide additional coordination capability with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (hydroxyl group is not at the para position relative to the carboxyl group)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (chains of **six to eight carbons**) **without additional interfering functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic alkyl chains may enhance interactions within the catalyst framework.

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **Octanoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **Perfluorinated acids** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) like methyl (-CH₃), methoxy (-OCH₃), or hydroxyl (-OH) at the para position**, without additional coordinating groups, result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) or formyl groups conjugated to the ring** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or undergo side reactions.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that contain **perfluoroalkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal.

   - **Example (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **amide bonds or peptide linkages** near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. Amide groups can act as competing ligands, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination by the carboxylate.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long flexible polyether chains** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains hinder effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without flexible linkers** result in a **low yield**. The rigid, bulky structure may cause steric hindrance, limiting effective metal coordination.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that have **functional groups capable of chelation (e.g., ketone, hydroxyl, thiol groups) within conjugated systems** result in a **high yield**. These groups enhance metal binding through multiple coordination sites.

    - **Examples (High Yield)**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (hydroxyl group involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding)

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxylic acid) result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in participating in chelation.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that contain **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** due to **ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups** in aromatic carboxylic acids result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of these groups for metal coordination.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance from the bulky side chains reduces effective metal coordination.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

**End of Rules**

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider the underlying physico-chemical properties that influence metal coordination and catalyst activity:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - Feature functional groups (amino, thiol, ketone) proximal to the carboxyl group for effective chelation.
  - Contain electron-withdrawing groups that enhance carboxylate acidity and coordination strength.
  - Include heterocyclic rings with nitrogen atoms providing additional coordination sites.
  - Have medium-length aliphatic chains without interfering functional groups, potentially enhancing hydrophobic interactions within the catalyst.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - Possess functional groups that decrease carboxylate basicity (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains) or compete with carboxylate coordination (amide bonds).
  - Contain electron-donating groups that weaken metal coordination.
  - Have bulky or inflexible structures causing steric hindrance.
  - Feature distal functional groups ineffective for chelation.
  - Include intramolecular hydrogen bonding that reduces availability of coordinating groups.

By applying these rules, we can predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset and balance simplicity with complexity to capture the key factors affecting the reaction yield.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** demonstrates clarity and adequate property insight by linking electron-withdrawing groups in aromatic carboxylic acids to increased yield. It is supported by sufficient data points and balances complexity with coverage.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** effectively combines heterocyclic structures with nitrogen atoms, providing clear guidance and strong property insight. It is supported by multiple examples and non-examples, meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** could benefit from increased clarity regarding the structural definitions. Specifically, it's unclear if the amino or hydroxyl groups need to be directly attached to the aromatic ring bearing the carboxyl group. Clarifying this would enhance the rule's applicability and adherence to the clarity criterion.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** appears to have limited coverage, with only one data point (octanoic acid) provided as an example of high yield. Additional supporting data points are needed to meet the coverage criterion and strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear and supported by sufficient data points, effectively linking electron-donating groups in aromatic carboxylic acids to low yield. It provides good property insight and balances complexity with coverage.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is well-defined with adequate physico-chemical reasoning and is supported by multiple data points. It meets the clarity, property insight, and coverage criteria effectively.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** lacks sufficient coverage, as it is based on a single data point involving perfluoroalkyl chains. To meet the coverage criterion, more examples of modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups resulting in low yield should be included.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear and provides strong property insight into how amide bonds affect metal coordination. It is supported by multiple data points, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** has limited coverage with only one supporting data point. Additional examples are needed to strengthen the rule and meet the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** also suffers from limited coverage, being based on a single data point. Including more examples would enhance its adherence to the scoring criteria.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** provides good property insight and has acceptable coverage with multiple examples. However, its broad scope might affect clarity. Refining the rule to be more specific could improve its clarity without compromising coverage.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** is clear and supported by multiple data points, effectively demonstrating how distal functional groups impact yield. It meets all the necessary criteria.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** has sufficient coverage and provides strong property insight into the effects of intramolecular hydrogen bonding. It meets the clarity and coverage criteria effectively.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** lacks adequate coverage, relying on a single data point (phenylalanine). Including additional examples of amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains resulting in low yield would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 16**: Several rules (**Rules 5, 8, 10, 11, and 15**) do not meet the coverage criterion, as they are supported by only one data point each. To adhere to the scoring criteria, these rules need additional supporting data points.

- **Comment 17**: Overall, while many rules are well-formulated and supported by data, the set of rules would benefit from addressing the coverage gaps in some cases. Enhancing these rules with additional data points or consolidating them could improve the overall quality and reliability of the predictions.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Coverage for Rule 5**: The current Rule 5 has limited coverage with only one example (**octanoic acid**). To strengthen this rule, identify and include additional medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chains of six to eight carbons) without interfering functional groups that result in high yield. Examples could include **hexanoic acid** and **heptanoic acid** if they show high yield. Also, provide non-examples where similar acids result in low yield to meet the coverage criterion.

- **Advice 2**: **Expand Rule 8 with More Data Points**: Rule 8 is based on a single data point involving perfluoroalkyl chains. To improve coverage, search for additional modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups that result in low yield. If such data is unavailable, consider merging Rule 8 with another rule that addresses strong electron-withdrawing groups reducing carboxylate basicity.

- **Advice 3**: **Increase Coverage for Rule 10**: Rule 10 has limited support. Identify other aliphatic carboxylic acids with long flexible polyether chains that result in low yield to strengthen this rule. Examples might include compounds like **methoxyethoxyacetic acid** or **polyethylene glycol monoacetic acid ester** if they exhibit low yield. Include non-examples to fully meet the coverage requirements.

- **Advice 4**: **Strengthen Rule 11 with Additional Examples**: Rule 11 currently relies on one example (**4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**). To enhance coverage, find other aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without flexible linkers that result in low yield. Potential examples could be **biphenyl-4-carboxylic acid** or **naphthalene-1-carboxylic acid**, provided they show low yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Augment Rule 15 with More Data Points**: Rule 15's coverage is insufficient, supported only by **phenylalanine**. Identify additional amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups that result in low yield. Examples could include **leucine**, **isoleucine**, or **valine** if data indicates they produce low yield in the reaction.

- **Advice 6**: **Clarify Structural Definitions in Rule 4**: Improve the clarity of Rule 4 by specifying whether the amino or hydroxyl groups must be directly attached to the aromatic ring bearing the carboxyl group or can be part of a side chain. For instance, state: "Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) directly attached to the aromatic ring at the para position result in a high yield."

- **Advice 7**: **Refine Rule 12 for Clarity**: Rule 12's broad scope may affect clarity. Consider splitting it into two more specific rules:

  - **Rule 12a**: Modifiers with ketone or thiol groups within conjugated systems enhance metal binding and result in high yield.
  - **Rule 12b**: Modifiers where hydroxyl groups are involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduce coordination availability and result in low yield.

  This refinement improves clarity while maintaining coverage.

- **Advice 8**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules**: Review the rules for potential consolidation. For example, Rules addressing steric hindrance due to bulky groups (Rules 10, 11, and 15) could be combined into a single rule highlighting that bulky or rigid structures hinder effective metal coordination, resulting in low yield. This simplifies the rule set and enhances overall coverage.

- **Advice 9**: **Include Additional Data Points Across All Rules**: To strengthen the validity of all rules, revisit the dataset to identify any additional modifiers that fit the existing rules. Including more examples and non-examples for each rule will enhance coverage and reliability.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate Rules with Experimental Data**: Where possible, support the rules with experimental data or literature references that confirm the impact of specific functional groups on the reaction yield. This adds credibility to the rules and provides a stronger foundation for predictions.

- **Advice 11**: **Consider Exceptions and Special Cases**: Acknowledge and document any known exceptions to the rules. For instance, if a modifier with an electron-donating group unexpectedly results in high yield due to other contributing factors, note this in the rule to provide a comprehensive understanding.

- **Advice 12**: **Ensure Consistency in Terminology**: Use consistent terminology throughout all rules to enhance clarity. For instance, uniformly refer to "proximal" functional groups as those within three carbons of the carboxylic acid and define terms like "distal" clearly.

- **Advice 13**: **Incorporate Visual Aids**: Where appropriate, include chemical structures or SMILES representations of the examples and non-examples. Visual aids can improve understanding and help in accurately identifying the structural features described in the rules.

- **Advice 14**: **Prioritize Rules Based on Impact**: Organize the rules so that the most impactful and broadly applicable ones are presented first. This helps in quickly identifying the key factors influencing the reaction yield.

- **Advice 15**: **Review and Update Rules Regularly**: As new data becomes available or as further analysis is conducted, revisit the rules to make necessary adjustments. Continual refinement ensures that the rules remain relevant and accurate.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) or thiol group (-SH) within three carbons of the carboxylic acid** result in a **high yield**. The proximity of these functional groups to the carboxyl group allows for effective chelation with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromo (-Br)** at the **para position** result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (contains an electron-donating group)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, strengthening interaction with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (sterically hindered biphenyl structure)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) or hydroxyl group (-OH) at the para position** result in a **high yield**. These groups provide additional coordination capability with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (hydroxyl group is not at the para position relative to the carboxyl group)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (chains of **six to eight carbons**) **without additional interfering functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic alkyl chains may enhance interactions within the catalyst framework.

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **Octanoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **Perfluorinated acids** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) like methyl (-CH₃), methoxy (-OCH₃), or hydroxyl (-OH) at the para position**, without additional coordinating groups, result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) or formyl groups conjugated to the ring** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or undergo side reactions.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that contain **perfluoroalkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal.

   - **Example (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **amide bonds or peptide linkages** near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. Amide groups can act as competing ligands, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination by the carboxylate.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long flexible polyether chains** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains hinder effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without flexible linkers** result in a **low yield**. The rigid, bulky structure may cause steric hindrance, limiting effective metal coordination.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that have **functional groups capable of chelation (e.g., ketone, hydroxyl, thiol groups) within conjugated systems** result in a **high yield**. These groups enhance metal binding through multiple coordination sites.

    - **Examples (High Yield)**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (hydroxyl group involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding)

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxylic acid) result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in participating in chelation.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that contain **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** due to **ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups** in aromatic carboxylic acids result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of these groups for metal coordination.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance from the bulky side chains reduces effective metal coordination.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

**End of Rules**

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider the underlying physico-chemical properties that influence metal coordination and catalyst activity:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - Feature functional groups (amino, thiol, ketone) proximal to the carboxyl group for effective chelation.
  - Contain electron-withdrawing groups that enhance carboxylate acidity and coordination strength.
  - Include heterocyclic rings with nitrogen atoms providing additional coordination sites.
  - Have medium-length aliphatic chains without interfering functional groups, potentially enhancing hydrophobic interactions within the catalyst.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - Possess functional groups that decrease carboxylate basicity (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains) or compete with carboxylate coordination (amide bonds).
  - Contain electron-donating groups that weaken metal coordination.
  - Have bulky or inflexible structures causing steric hindrance.
  - Feature distal functional groups ineffective for chelation.
  - Include intramolecular hydrogen bonding that reduces availability of coordinating groups.

By applying these rules, we can predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset and balance simplicity with complexity to capture the key factors affecting the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Adjust the path length calculation in Rule 1**. The code currently uses `len(path_length) - 1 <= 4`, which includes functional groups up to four bonds away from the carboxylic acid. Since the rule specifies "within three carbons," the maximum number of bonds should be three. Update the condition to `len(path_length) - 1 <= 3` to accurately reflect the rule.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Ensure all matching atoms are considered in substructure searches**. In Rule 1, the code uses `[match[0] for match in mol.GetSubstructMatches(carboxylic_acid)]`, which might miss relevant carboxylic acid groups if there are multiple in the molecule. Instead, collect all atom indices involved in each match, e.g., `ca_atoms = [atom_idx for match in mol.GetSubstructMatches(carboxylic_acid) for atom_idx in match]`.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Expand SMARTS patterns for heterocyclic rings in Rule 3**. Currently, the code uses `pyridine_ring = Chem.MolFromSmarts('n1ccccc1')`, which only matches pyridine. Update the SMARTS to match any heterocyclic ring containing nitrogen atoms, such as `aromatic_nitrogen_heterocycle = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[n,o,s]1cccc1')`.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Refine the method for determining substituent positions on aromatic rings**. For Rules 2, 4, 6, and 7, the code relies on atom indices and their positions in the ring. This approach can be unreliable due to the way RDKit assigns atom indices. Implement a function that calculates the shortest path along the ring between substituents to determine relative positions (ortho, meta, para).

- **Suggestion 5**: **Correct the SMARTS pattern for nitro groups in Rule 2**. The code uses `[NX3](=O)[O-]`, which may not match the nitro group correctly. Use `[NX3](=O)=O` to match the nitro group regardless of charge states, ensuring accurate detection.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Improve detection of electron-donating groups (EDGs) and electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)**. For Rules 2 and 6, clearly define and list the EDGs and EWGs in SMARTS patterns. For example, use `EDG_para = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1)[CX4H3,OX2H,OX2][CH3]')` for methyl, methoxy, and hydroxyl groups at the para position.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Adjust carbon counting in Rule 5**. The code assumes the total number of carbons in the molecule corresponds to the chain length, which may not be accurate for branched molecules. Use RDKit's `Chem.rdmolops.GetMolFrags()` and `Chem.rdmolops.GetShortestPath()` functions to identify the longest linear carbon chain attached to the carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Enhance detection of interfering functional groups in Rule 5**. Incorporate SMARTS patterns for common interfering groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, halogens) and check if they are present in the molecule. Only assign a positive match if these groups are absent.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Update the SMARTS pattern for perfluoroalkyl chains in Rule 8**. Instead of using `C(F)(F)F`, which matches trifluoromethyl groups, use a recursive pattern to match longer perfluoroalkyl chains, such as `perfluoroalkyl = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX4](F)(F)F')` and extend it to match chains like `C(F)(F)C(F)(F)F`.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Improve Rule 13 to accurately detect distal functional groups**. Ensure that the code identifies functional groups that are more than three carbons away from the carboxylic acid. Adjust the path length condition to `len(path_length) - 1 > 3`.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Refine SMARTS patterns for intramolecular hydrogen bonding in Rule 14**. The current pattern may not capture all ortho-substituted hydroxyl or formyl groups. Develop a more general SMARTS pattern that identifies ortho relationships, such as using ring queries and neighbor atoms.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Implement comprehensive unit tests for each rule**. Before applying the code to the dataset, create test cases with known outcomes to validate that each rule is implemented correctly. Include both positive and negative examples to ensure reliability.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Consider stereochemistry and tautomeric forms**. Some molecules may have multiple valid representations or exist in different tautomeric forms. Use RDKit's `MolStandardize` module to standardize molecules before applying the rules.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Improve readability and maintainability of the code**. For each rule, encapsulate the code logic into separate functions with descriptive names. This approach makes the code easier to debug and modify in the future.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Document the code thoroughly**. Add comments explaining the purpose and logic of each code block, especially where complex cheminformatics operations are performed. This documentation will aid collaborators in understanding and refining the code.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Performance Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

The current rules demonstrate an improvement in predictive accuracy, as indicated by higher confidence and lift values compared to the reference metrics. However, there is a notable decrease in support and a slight reduction in leverage. Below is a detailed analysis:

---

### **1. Comparison of Metrics**

#### **Confidence**

- **Reference Metrics (Train Confidence):**
  - Mean Confidence: \[(0.6352 + 0.5396) / 2 = 0.5874\]
- **Current Metric (Train Confidence):**
  - Confidence: **0.6517**

**Analysis:**
The current rules exhibit a higher confidence (0.6517) than the average of the reference metrics (0.5874). This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood that the rule prediction (high or low yield) is correct has increased. A higher confidence value signifies that the rules are more reliable in predicting outcomes for the cases they cover.

---

#### **Lift**

- **Reference Metrics (Train Lift):**
  - Mean Lift: \[(1.2048 + 1.0559) / 2 = 1.1304\]
- **Current Metric (Train Lift):**
  - Lift: **1.3092**

**Analysis:**
The lift value has improved from the reference average of 1.1304 to 1.3092 in the current rules. Lift measures how much more likely the prediction is compared to a random chance. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is useful, and a higher lift value suggests a stronger association between the rule conditions and the outcome. The increase in lift signifies that the current rules are more effective in distinguishing between high and low yields.

---

#### **Support**

- **Reference Metrics (Train Support):**
  - Mean Support: \[(0.1667 + 0.1845) / 2 = 0.1756\]
- **Current Metric (Train Support):**
  - Support: **0.0419**

**Analysis:**
The support for the current rules has decreased significantly compared to the reference. Lower support means that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. While higher confidence and lift are desirable, very low support may limit the practical applicability of the rules, as they affect fewer cases.

---

#### **Leverage**

- **Reference Metrics (Train Leverage):**
  - Mean Leverage: \[(0.0289 + (-0.0041)) / 2 = 0.0124\]
- **Current Metric (Train Leverage):**
  - Leverage: **0.0074**

**Analysis:**
The leverage has slightly decreased from the reference average of 0.0124 to 0.0074. Positive leverage indicates that the rule's prediction is more frequent than expected by chance; however, the small decrease suggests that the strength of the association has not substantially improved.

---

### **2. Determining if a Local Minimum Has Been Reached**

A local minimum in this context refers to a point in the iterative process where further adjustments to the rules do not yield significant improvements in the metrics. The current metrics show:

- **Improved Confidence and Lift:** Indicates that the predictive power of the rules has enhanced.
- **Decreased Support:** Suggests that the rules are becoming more specific, covering fewer cases.
- **Slight Decrease in Leverage:** May imply that the rules are not significantly improving the association strength beyond chance.

**Assessment:**

- The increase in confidence and lift without corresponding increases in leverage and support suggests that the rules may be overfitting the training data—becoming too specific to particular cases.
- The fluctuations in the metrics over the iterations indicate that the algorithm is still exploring the solution space and has not settled into a local minimum.
- Given that support is decreasing, it may be premature to conclude that a local minimum has been reached. Further iterations are warranted to balance the trade-off between rule specificity (confidence and lift) and generality (support).

---

### **3. Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the rules and move towards an optimal solution, consider the following suggestions:

#### **a. Balance Confidence and Support**

- **Generalize Rule Conditions:** Slightly relax the specific conditions in the rules to increase support without significantly compromising confidence.
  - **Example:** Instead of specifying functional groups within exactly three carbons, consider a range (e.g., within four carbons) to include more compounds while maintaining high predictive accuracy.
- **Combine Similar Rules:** Merge rules that have overlapping conditions or similar outcomes to broaden their applicability.

#### **b. Enhance Leverage**

- **Focus on High Leverage Rules:** Identify and refine rules that not only have high confidence and lift but also significantly positive leverage, indicating that they capture associations not expected by chance.
- **Eliminate Redundant Conditions:** Remove unnecessary conditions that do not contribute to increasing leverage but may reduce support.

#### **c. Avoid Overfitting**

- **Simplify Rules:** Limit the number of conditions in each rule to the most impactful ones. Overly complex rules may perform well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
- **Validate with External Data:** Test the rules on a validation or test dataset to ensure they generalize well beyond the training data.

#### **d. Incorporate Additional Data Analysis**

- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Use statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to identify which molecular features most significantly impact yield.
- **Cross-Validation:** Employ cross-validation techniques to assess the robustness of the rules across different subsets of the data.

#### **e. Consider Missing Metrics**

- **Test Metrics Evaluation:** Since test metrics are not provided for the current iteration, evaluating the rules on test data is crucial to assess their generalization performance.
- **Monitor Metric Trends:** Track how the metrics change with each iteration to identify patterns or diminishing returns in improvement.

#### **f. Iterative Refinement**

- **Set Stopping Criteria:** Define clear criteria for when to stop iterating, such as when improvements in confidence and lift plateau or when support falls below a practical threshold.
- **Collaborative Review:** Engage with other agents in the research program to review the rules and provide insights based on domain expertise.

---

### **4. Improving Specific Rules**

- **Identify Underperforming Rules:** Analyze individual rules with low support or leverage to determine if they can be modified or should be removed.
- **Enhance High Potential Rules:**
  - **Rule 1 Example:** Adjust the definition of proximity for functional groups to the carboxylic acid to include more compounds.
  - **Rule 5 Example:** Redefine "medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids" to potentially include a broader range of chain lengths.
- **Incorporate Counterexamples:** Use non-examples to refine the conditions of the rules, ensuring they accurately distinguish between high and low yields.

---

### **Conclusion**

The current rules show promise with increased confidence and lift, indicating better predictive accuracy when the rules apply. However, the decrease in support suggests that these rules are becoming too narrow, potentially limiting their usefulness. To achieve a more optimal set of rules:

- **Strive for a Balance:** Aim for rules that have high confidence and lift but also maintain sufficient support to be practically valuable.
- **Continue Iterations:** Further refinement is needed to adjust the specificity of the rules and explore the solution space thoroughly.
- **Validate Externally:** Use test datasets and cross-validation to ensure that improvements will generalize beyond the training data.
- **Collaborate and Review:** Leverage the insights of the research team to refine the rules based on both data-driven metrics and domain knowledge.

By addressing these areas, the rules can be improved to provide robust and generalizable predictions, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of the catalytic research program.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

1. **Accuracies of Validation and Training Sets:**
   
   - *Previous Metrics:* In earlier iterations, the validation accuracies were relatively high, often around 76%, with test accuracies ranging from 62.5% to 75%. For example:
     - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
     - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
     - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625
   - *Current Metrics:* In the latest iteration, the validation accuracy has decreased:
     - **Validation Accuracy:** 62.86%
     - This represents a decline from earlier iterations, suggesting that recent changes to the rules may not have improved the model's predictive performance.
   - **Interpretation:** The decrease in validation accuracy indicates that the current set of rules may not be capturing the essential features necessary for accurate predictions. The variability in accuracy across iterations suggests inconsistency in the model's performance.

2. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   
   - The current rules, while comprehensive, may not be effectively distinguishing between high and low modifier loadings as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy.
   - Some rules may be contributing to incorrect predictions, either by overestimating or underestimating modifier loading.
   - The lack of consistent improvement in accuracy suggests that the rules may need refinement to better capture the underlying chemical interactions influencing catalyst performance.

3. **Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   
   - **Overfitting:** The model may be overfitting if it performs well on training data but poorly on validation data. However, given that validation accuracy is decreasing, overfitting may not be the primary issue.
   - **Underfitting:** The model appears to be underfitting, as it is not capturing the complexity of the data sufficiently to make accurate predictions. Simplistic or overly general rules may fail to account for important nuances in molecular structures.
   - **Conclusion:** The model may benefit from refining the rules to strike a better balance between complexity and generalization.

4. **Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values:**

   - **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**
     - *Example Molecules:*
       - **C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
       - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O**
       - **C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN**
       - **CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O**
     - *SHAP Analysis:*
       - **Rule 8 and Rule 10** have high positive SHAP values contributing to the overestimated loadings.
       - For instance, in the molecule **C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**, both Rule 8 and Rule 10 have SHAP values of approximately 0.0416 and 0.0417, respectively.
     - *Interpretation:*
       - The positive SHAP values of these rules in misclassified molecules suggest that **Rule 8** and **Rule 10** may be incorrectly contributing to high predictions where they should not.
   
   - **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**
     - In the provided data, there are fewer examples of underestimated loadings. If present, the rules with high negative SHAP values in these cases would be identified as problematic.
     - In this iteration, most misclassifications are overestimations, indicating a potential bias in the model towards predicting higher loadings.

5. **Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

   - The lack of improvement and even a decline in validation accuracy suggests that the current rules may not be leading towards better generalization.
   - Repeated fluctuations in accuracy without consistent upward trends indicate that the model may have reached a local minimum in performance.
   - This stagnation emphasizes the need to revisit and refine the existing rules.

6. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Rule 8** and **Rule 10** are frequently associated with high positive SHAP values in misclassified molecules.
   - **Rule 8:** Pertains to modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains resulting in low yield.
   - **Rule 10:** Involves aliphatic carboxylic acids with long flexible polyether chains resulting in low yield.
   - The positive SHAP contributions of these rules in overestimated loadings suggest that they may not be accurately capturing the intended chemical interactions.
   - There may be a need to reevaluate the definitions or applicability of these rules to certain molecular structures.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refinement of Rule 8:**

   - **Current Issue:**
     - **Rule 8** is intended to assign low yield to modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains.
     - However, positive SHAP values in overestimated loadings imply that the rule is contributing to high predictions instead.
   - **Suggested Improvements:**
     - **Clarify the Scope:** Ensure that the rule accurately identifies perfluoroalkyl chains and distinguishes them from other fluorinated compounds.
     - **Add Specificity:** Incorporate additional structural criteria, such as chain length or degree of fluorination, to improve rule precision.
     - **Consider Exceptions:** Identify any molecular contexts where perfluoroalkyl chains may not lead to low yield and adjust the rule accordingly.

2. **Adjustment of Rule 10:**

   - **Current Issue:**
     - **Rule 10** attributes low yield to aliphatic carboxylic acids with long flexible polyether chains.
     - Its positive SHAP contributions in overestimations suggest misalignment with experimental outcomes.
   - **Suggested Improvements:**
     - **Redefine Chain Length Thresholds:** Reevaluate what constitutes a "long" polyether chain in the context of affecting yield.
     - **Evaluate Steric Effects:** Consider incorporating steric hindrance or flexibility factors more explicitly into the rule.
     - **Exclude Certain Functional Groups:** Examine if specific functional groups within the polyether chains mitigate the negative impact on yield.

3. **Reexamination of Rule 13:**

   - **Observation:**
     - **Rule 13** deals with aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups resulting in low yield.
     - If SHAP analysis shows inconsistencies with this rule, it may require refinement.
   - **Suggested Improvements:**
     - **Assess Functional Group Influence:** Determine whether all distal functional groups equally affect yield or if certain groups have more significant impacts.
     - **Adjust Spatial Criteria:** Modify the definition of "distal" to better reflect the distance at which functional groups influence coordination.

4. **Enhancement of Rule Definitions:**

   - **Increase Specificity:**
     - Avoid broad or overly general rules that may misclassify molecules.
     - Incorporate specific structural motifs or functional group arrangements known to influence catalytic activity.
   - **Incorporate Quantitative Measures:**
     - Where possible, include quantitative thresholds (e.g., chain lengths, electronegativity values) to refine rule applicability.
   - **Use Chemical Intuition:**
     - Leverage known chemical principles, such as HSAB theory (hard and soft acids and bases), to predict interactions more accurately.

5. **Addressing Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules:**
     - Complex rules may fit the training data well but fail to generalize; consider simplifying such rules.
   - **Combine Redundant Rules:**
     - Identify and merge rules that overlap significantly to reduce redundancy.
   - **Introduce New Relevant Features:**
     - If certain molecular features are not captured by existing rules, consider adding new rules to account for them.

6. **Iterative Testing and Validation:**

   - **Monitor Changes in Accuracies:**
     - After refining rules, re-evaluate the model to observe changes in validation accuracy.
   - **Cross-Validation:**
     - Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that improvements are consistent across different data subsets.
   - **SHAP Analysis Feedback Loop:**
     - Continue using SHAP analysis in each iteration to identify and adjust problematic rules.

7. **Incorporate Additional Data:**

   - **Expand the Dataset:**
     - If possible, include more examples, especially of molecules that are currently misclassified, to improve model learning.
   - **Diverse Functional Groups:**
     - Ensure that the dataset represents a wide range of functional groups and structural types.

8. **Consult Domain Expertise:**

   - **Expert Review:**
     - Have a chemist with expertise in catalysis review the rules for chemical validity.
   - **Literature Survey:**
     - Reference recent studies to update rules with the latest findings in catalyst-modifier interactions.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules provide a solid foundation but need refinement to improve the model's predictive performance. By focusing on the rules identified through SHAP analysis as contributing to misclassifications, and adjusting them based on chemical principles and empirical data, we can enhance the model's accuracy. Iterative testing and validation will be essential to ensure that these refinements lead to consistent and generalizable improvements.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current set of rules aims to predict the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on the structural features of molecular modifiers. Recent analyses have highlighted several areas where the rules can be optimized to improve predictive accuracy, coverage, and generalizability.

**Key Points from the Discussions:**

1. **Performance Metrics:**
   - **Confidence and Lift:** The current rules show improved confidence and lift compared to previous metrics, indicating better predictive power when the rules apply.
   - **Support and Leverage:** There is a significant decrease in support, meaning the rules cover fewer cases. Leverage has slightly decreased, suggesting that the strength of association has not substantially improved.
   - **Validation Accuracy:** Validation accuracy has decreased in recent iterations, indicating potential issues with the rules’ ability to generalize.

2. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - **Rules Contributing to Misclassifications:** Certain rules (e.g., Rule 8 and Rule 10) have high positive SHAP values in cases where the model overestimates the modifier loading, suggesting these rules may be incorrectly contributing to high predictions.

3. **Rule-Specific Suggestions:**
   - **Rule 1 (Adjust Path Length Calculation):**
     - **Issue:** The path length condition may include functional groups beyond the intended proximity.
     - **Suggestion:** Adjust the condition to `len(path_length) - 1 <= 3` to accurately reflect functional groups within three carbons of the carboxylic acid.

   - **Rule 2 and 6 (Optimize Detection of EWGs and EDGs):**
     - **Issue:** Current SMARTS patterns may not accurately capture all electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups.
     - **Suggestion:** Clearly define and implement comprehensive SMARTS patterns for common EWGs (e.g., -NO₂, -Br) and EDGs (e.g., -CH₃, -OCH₃, -OH) at specific positions.

   - **Rule 3 (Expand Heterocyclic Ring Patterns):**
     - **Issue:** The current pattern only matches pyridine rings.
     - **Suggestion:** Expand the SMARTS pattern to include other nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as imidazole and pyrazole rings.

   - **Rule 5 (Adjust Chain Length Criteria):**
     - **Issue:** The method for determining chain length may not be accurate for branched molecules.
     - **Suggestion:** Use RDKit functions to identify the longest linear carbon chain connected to the carboxylic acid group.

   - **Rule 8 and 10 (Refine Definitions Based on SHAP Analysis):**
     - **Issue:** These rules may be contributing to incorrect predictions.
     - **Suggestion for Rule 8:** Update the SMARTS pattern to capture longer perfluoroalkyl chains accurately.
     - **Suggestion for Rule 10:** Reevaluate what constitutes a "long" polyether chain and consider steric effects.

   - **Rule 13 (Detect Distal Functional Groups More Accurately):**
     - **Issue:** The rule may not correctly identify functional groups more than three carbons away.
     - **Suggestion:** Adjust the path length condition to `len(path_length) - 1 > 3` to capture distal groups.

   - **Rule 14 (Improve Detection of Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding):**
     - **Issue:** The current patterns may not detect all cases of intramolecular hydrogen bonding.
     - **Suggestion:** Develop more general SMARTS patterns that identify ortho-substituted hydroxyl or formyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

4. **General Suggestions:**
   - **Enhance Substituent Position Determination:**
     - Implement methods to accurately determine substituent positions (ortho, meta, para) on aromatic rings, possibly by calculating the shortest path along the ring.

   - **Simplify and Combine Rules:**
     - Identify overlapping or redundant rules and consider merging them to simplify the ruleset without sacrificing predictive power.

   - **Avoid Overfitting and Underfitting:**
     - Balance rule complexity to avoid overfitting (too specific rules) and underfitting (overly general rules that lack predictive power).

   - **Validate with External Data:**
     - Test the refined rules on an external validation set to ensure they generalize well beyond the training data.

   - **Incorporate Chemical Intuition:**
     - Leverage domain knowledge and chemical principles (e.g., HSAB theory) in refining the rules.

   - **Implement Unit Tests for Rules:**
     - Create test cases with known outcomes to validate each rule's implementation.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Rule 1 Optimization:**
   - **Action:** Adjust the path length condition to `len(path_length) - 1 <= 3`.
   - **Benefit:** Accurately reflects functional groups within three carbons, improving rule precision.

2. **Expand SMARTS Patterns:**
   - **Rule 2 and 6:**
     - **Action:** Define SMARTS patterns for EWGs and EDGs explicitly. For instance, use patterns like `[cH]c[cH]c[cH][cX3](=O)[OH]` for para-substituted aromatic acids.
   - **Rule 3:**
     - **Action:** Use a broader SMARTS pattern to match various nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as `[$([nH]1cccc1),$([nH]1cccn1),$([nH]1ccncn1)]`.

3. **Improve Substituent Position Detection:**
   - **Action:** Implement algorithms to determine substituent positions on aromatic rings by calculating the shortest paths between atoms.
   - **Benefit:** Ensures accurate identification of para, meta, and ortho positions, critical for rules involving positional substituents.

4. **Refine Rules Based on SHAP Analysis:**
   - **Rule 8:**
     - **Action:** Update the perfluoroalkyl chain detection to include longer chains and adjust the rule to account for their impact on yield accurately.
   - **Rule 10:**
     - **Action:** Redefine the criteria for "long" polyether chains and consider the role of chain flexibility and steric hindrance.

5. **Adjust Chain Length Determination in Rule 5:**
   - **Action:** Use RDKit's methods to determine the longest linear carbon chain attached to the carboxylic acid, rather than relying on the total number of carbons.

6. **Enhance Detection of Interfering Functional Groups:**
   - **Action:** Include SMARTS patterns for common interfering groups (e.g., `[OH]`, `[NH2]`, `[Hal]`) and incorporate checks to ensure they're absent when required by a rule.

7. **Simplify Rules and Avoid Redundancy:**
   - **Action:** Combine rules with overlapping conditions or similar outcomes to improve support while maintaining confidence.

8. **Implement Comprehensive Unit Testing:**
   - **Action:** Develop unit tests for each rule with positive and negative examples to ensure they function as intended.

9. **Update Rule 14 for Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding:**
   - **Action:** Create SMARTS patterns that identify ortho-substituted groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, such as `c1cc([OH])[cH][cH]c1[C](=O)O`.

10. **Leverage Chemical Standardization:**
    - **Action:** Use RDKit's `MolStandardize` module to standardize molecules before applying rules to account for tautomeric forms and stereochemistry.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Yes, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the rules based on the suggestions above, we can enhance their accuracy and generalizability. The key is to ensure that the rules are precise enough to make accurate predictions while being general enough to apply to a broad range of compounds. Implementing these improvements should address the issues identified in performance metrics and SHAP analysis, leading to a more robust predictive model.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromo (-Br)** at the **para position** result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (contains an electron-donating group)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, strengthening interaction with the metal center.

     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (chains of **six to eight carbons**) **without additional interfering functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic alkyl chains may enhance interactions within the catalyst framework.

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **Octanoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **Perfluorinated acids** (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) like methyl (-CH₃), methoxy (-OCH₃), or hydroxyl (-OH) at the para position**, without additional coordinating groups, result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) or formyl groups conjugated to the ring** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or undergo side reactions.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that contain **perfluoroalkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal.

   - **Example (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **amide bonds or peptide linkages** near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. Amide groups can act as competing ligands, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination by the carboxylate.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long flexible polyether chains** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains hinder effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids directly connected to another aromatic ring without flexible linkers** result in a **low yield**. The rigid, bulky structure may cause steric hindrance, limiting effective metal coordination.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that have **functional groups capable of chelation (e.g., ketone, hydroxyl, thiol groups) within conjugated systems** result in a **high yield**. These groups enhance metal binding through multiple coordination sites.

      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (hydroxyl group involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding)

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxylic acid) result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective in participating in chelation.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that contain **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** due to **ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups** in aromatic carboxylic acids result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of these groups for metal coordination.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance from the bulky side chains reduces effective metal coordination.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

**End of Rules**

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider the underlying physico-chemical properties that influence metal coordination and catalyst activity:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - Feature functional groups (amino, thiol, ketone) proximal to the carboxyl group for effective chelation.
  - Contain electron-withdrawing groups that enhance carboxylate acidity and coordination strength.
  - Include heterocyclic rings with nitrogen atoms providing additional coordination sites.
  - Have medium-length aliphatic chains without interfering functional groups, potentially enhancing hydrophobic interactions within the catalyst.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - Possess functional groups that decrease carboxylate basicity (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains) or compete with carboxylate coordination (amide bonds).
  - Contain electron-donating groups that weaken metal coordination.
  - Have bulky or inflexible structures causing steric hindrance.
  - Feature distal functional groups ineffective for chelation.
  - Include intramolecular hydrogen bonding that reduces availability of coordinating groups.

By applying these rules, we can predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset and balance simplicity with complexity to capture the key factors affecting the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: *Adjust Rule 1 to Correct Path Length Calculation*

  - **Action**: Modify Rule 1's condition for determining the proximity of functional groups to the carboxylic acid. Change the condition from `len(path) <= 3` to `len(path) - 1 <= 3`.
  - **Implementation**: In your SMILES-based rule, ensure that the path length accounts for the number of bonds rather than the number of atoms. This adjustment accurately captures functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol) that are within three bonds (carbons) of the carboxyl group.
  - **Benefit**: This correction improves the precision of Rule 1 by correctly identifying modifiers where functional groups can effectively chelate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity and leading to a high yield.

- **Advice 2**: *Define Explicit SMARTS Patterns for EWGs and EDGs in Rules 2 and 6*

  - **Action**: Refine Rules 2 and 6 by clearly defining SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position on aromatic carboxylic acids.
  - **Implementation**:
    - For EWGs in Rule 2, use SMARTS patterns like `[cH]c1ccc([NX3](=O)=O)cc1C(=O)O` for nitro groups or `[cH]c1ccc(Br)cc1C(=O)O` for bromo groups at the para position.
    - For EDGs in Rule 6, use patterns like `[cH]c1ccc([CH3])cc1C(=O)O` for methyl groups or `[cH]c1ccc(O[CH3])cc1C(=O)O` for methoxy groups at the para position.
  - **Benefit**: Explicit SMARTS patterns improve the specificity of the rules by accurately detecting the presence and position of these substituents, leading to more reliable predictions of yield based on the modifiers' electronic effects.

- **Advice 3**: *Expand Heterocyclic Ring Patterns in Rule 3*

  - **Action**: Broaden the scope of Rule 3 to include a variety of nitrogen-containing heterocycles beyond pyridine rings.
  - **Implementation**: Update the SMARTS pattern to match rings like imidazole (`n1cnc2c1ncnc2`), pyrazole (`n1ccn[nH]1`), and pyrimidine (`c1ccnc[nH]1`), in addition to pyridine.
  - **Benefit**: Including a wider range of heterocyclic structures enhances Rule 3's ability to identify high-yield modifiers that provide additional coordination sites through nitrogen atoms in the ring.

- **Advice 4**: *Adjust Chain Length Criteria in Rule 5 Using Accurate Chain Identification*

  - **Action**: Modify Rule 5 to accurately determine the length of the aliphatic chain attached to the carboxylic acid group.
  - **Implementation**: Utilize RDKit's `GetLongestChain()` function or perform a recursive search to find the longest continuous carbon chain connected to the carboxylate carbon. Define medium-chain aliphatic acids specifically as those with a chain length of six to eight carbons.
  - **Benefit**: Precise identification of chain length ensures that Rule 5 correctly classifies modifiers with medium-length aliphatic chains, which may enhance hydrophobic interactions in the catalyst framework and result in a high yield.

- **Advice 5**: *Refine Rule 8 to Accurately Detect Perfluoroalkyl Chains*

  - **Action**: Update Rule 8's SMARTS pattern to detect perfluoroalkyl chains of varying lengths accurately.
  - **Implementation**: Create a SMARTS pattern like `[*][C](F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(=O)O` to match perfluorinated chains, ensuring that all carbons in the chain are fully fluorinated. Also, consider using recursive SMARTS to capture longer chains: `[$([C](F)(F)(F))]-[*]-[$([C](F)(F)(F))]`.
  - **Benefit**: Improved detection of perfluoroalkyl chains helps Rule 8 more accurately predict low yields associated with the strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms, which weaken metal coordination.

- **Advice 6**: *Redefine Criteria for Long Flexible Polyether Chains in Rule 10*

  - **Action**: Modify Rule 10 to better define what constitutes a long flexible polyether chain that negatively impacts yield.
  - **Implementation**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to detect polyether chains with multiple ether linkages, such as `[OCH2CH2]*O[CH2]C(=O)O`, representing chains with three or more ethylene glycol units attached to the carboxylic acid.
  - **Benefit**: Accurately identifying long polyether chains allows Rule 10 to better predict low yields due to steric hindrance and entropic factors that interfere with effective metal coordination.

- **Advice 7**: *Enhance Substituent Position Determination on Aromatic Rings*

  - **Action**: Implement methods to determine substituent positions (ortho, meta, para) relative to the carboxyl group on aromatic rings.
  - **Implementation**: Use graph-based algorithms to calculate the shortest path between the carboxyl carbon and the substituent atom along the aromatic ring. Incorporate these calculations into your rules to distinguish between ortho, meta, and para positions.
  - **Benefit**: Accurate determination of substituent positions improves the specificity of rules involving positional isomers, such as Rules 4, 6, and 14, leading to more precise yield predictions.

- **Advice 8**: *Combine Overlapping Rules to Simplify the Ruleset*

  - **Action**: Review the current rules to identify overlap or redundancy and consolidate them where appropriate.
  - **Implementation**: For example, merge Rules 2 and 12, which both address modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups enhancing coordination, or combine Rules 13 and 14 related to the effect of functional group positioning on yield.
  - **Benefit**: Simplifying the ruleset reduces complexity, increases support (number of cases a rule applies to), and maintains or improves confidence by focusing on the most significant structural features affecting yield.

- **Advice 9**: *Implement Unit Tests for Each Rule*

  - **Action**: Develop unit tests with positive and negative examples for each rule to validate their accuracy.
  - **Implementation**: For each rule, create a set of modifiers known to comply or not comply with the rule conditions. Apply the rules to these test cases to ensure they produce the expected outcomes.
  - **Benefit**: Unit testing helps identify and correct errors in rule implementation, ensuring that each rule functions as intended and increases the reliability of the overall model.

- **Advice 10**: *Incorporate Chemical Intuition and Domain Knowledge*

  - **Action**: Use fundamental chemical principles and domain expertise to refine the rules further.
  - **Implementation**: Consider factors such as hard and soft acid-base interactions, steric hindrance, resonance effects, and chelate ring sizes when evaluating and adjusting the rules.
  - **Benefit**: Grounding the rules in established chemical concepts enhances their robustness and ensures they reflect the true underlying mechanisms influencing the reaction yield.

- **Advice 11**: *Improve Detection of Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding in Rule 14*

  - **Action**: Develop more general SMARTS patterns to identify ortho-substituted hydroxyl or formyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding.
  - **Implementation**: Use patterns like `c1cc([C](=O)O)cc([OH])c1` for ortho-hydroxyl groups and `c1cc([C](=O)O)cc(C=O)c1` for ortho-formyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid.
  - **Benefit**: Enhanced detection of intramolecular hydrogen bonding sites allows Rule 14 to more accurately predict low yields associated with reduced availability of coordinating groups due to internal hydrogen bonding.

- **Advice 12**: *Standardize Molecules Before Applying Rules*

  - **Action**: Utilize RDKit's `MolStandardize` module to preprocess molecules.
  - **Implementation**: Apply standardization protocols to adjust tautomers, protonation states, stereochemistry, and other structural variations that may affect rule application.
  - **Benefit**: Standardizing molecules ensures consistent input for the rules, reduces errors due to structural inconsistencies, and improves the reliability of predictions.

- **Advice 13**: *Validate Refined Rules with an External Dataset*

  - **Action**: Test the optimized rules on an external validation set not used in the rule development.
  - **Implementation**: Collect a set of modifiers with known yields and apply the refined rules to predict their outcomes. Compare the predictions with actual results to assess the rules' generalizability.
  - **Benefit**: External validation helps identify any overfitting to the original dataset and ensures that the rules perform well with new, unseen data.

- **Advice 14**: *Reevaluate Rules Impacting Misclassifications Based on SHAP Analysis*

  - **Action**: Examine rules that contribute to incorrect predictions and adjust them accordingly.
  - **Implementation**: For example, if Rule 9 (amide bonds or peptide linkages) is leading to misclassifications, revisit the conditions and SMARTS patterns to ensure they are not overly broad or incorrectly specified.
  - **Benefit**: Refining these rules reduces their negative impact on the model's accuracy and leads to more reliable yield predictions.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are derived from analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physico-chemical properties influencing the reaction yield. They combine multiple functional groups and structural features to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Proximal Functional Groups**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group enhance metal chelation.
  - **Aromatic Coordination Sites**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups at the para position provide additional coordination points.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Strong EWGs at the para position (excluding aldehydes) increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing metal binding.
  - **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles**: Heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms offer extra coordination sites.
  - **Hydrophobic Interactions**: Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without interfering groups may improve catalyst-framework interactions.
  - **Chelation within Conjugated Systems**: Functional groups capable of chelation within conjugated systems strengthen metal coordination.
  - **Polar Side Chains**: Amino acids with hydrophilic or polar side chains can form additional interactions with the metal center.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Distal Functional Groups**: Functional groups located far from the carboxyl group are less effective for chelation and may introduce steric hindrance.
  - **Perfluoroalkyl Chains**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects reduce carboxylate basicity, weakening coordination.
  - **Aldehyde Groups**: Aldehyde groups can interfere with coordination or participate in side reactions.
  - **Bulky Structures**: Sterically hindered modifiers reduce effective metal interaction.
  - **Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding**: Reduces availability of coordinating groups like hydroxyl or formyl groups.
  - **Amide Bonds**: Compete with carboxylate for metal coordination, decreasing catalyst effectiveness.
  - **Flexible Polyether Chains**: Increase steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination due to conformational flexibility.
  - **Multi-Functionalized Aliphatic Chains**: Multiple competing functional groups introduce steric and electronic complications.

By applying these rules, one can predict the potential effectiveness of a molecular modifier in enhancing the reaction yield. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity to capture key factors affecting the catalytic performance.

**Overall Assessment**:

Most rules are clear, provide solid chemical insight, consider complex combinations of structural features, and are supported by sufficient data points. While Rules 7, 14, and 15 have limited coverage due to fewer supporting examples, they are still valuable for capturing specific insights. The rules collectively offer a balanced and comprehensive framework for predicting reaction yield based on modifier structure.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) or thiol group (-SH) located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. The close proximity allows for effective chelation with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (amino group too distant)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (amide group reduces coordination)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) or hydroxyl group (-OH) at the para position** result in a **high yield**. These groups provide additional coordination sites, strengthening the interaction with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (short linker reduces flexibility)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (intramolecular hydrogen bonding interferes)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromoalkyl (-CH₂Br)** at the **para position**, excluding aldehyde groups, result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (aldehyde group can interfere with coordination)
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating group)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, improving catalyst efficiency.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (bulky structure causes steric hindrance)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long alkyl chains (6-8 carbons) without additional functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions within the catalyst framework.

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **Octanoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (distal amino group introduces steric hindrance)
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxyl group) result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective for chelation and may introduce steric hindrance.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Example (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) or formyl groups attached to the ring** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **bulky or sterically hindered structures** lead to a **low yield** due to decreased ability to coordinate with metal centers.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (rigid biphenyl structure)
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **functional groups capable of chelation (e.g., hydroxyl, ketone, or nitrogen atoms) within conjugated systems** result in a **high yield**. These groups enhance metal binding through multiple coordination sites.

    - **Examples (High Yield)**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces coordination)

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with hydrophilic or polar side chains capable of forming additional interactions** result in a **high yield**. Such side chains enhance binding to the metal center.

    - **Examples (High Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky, hydrophobic side chain)

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** due to **ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups** on aromatic rings result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of coordinating groups.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds or peptide linkages near the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. Amide groups can compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, reducing catalyst efficiency.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible polyether chains** result in a **low yield**. The steric bulk and flexibility hinder effective coordination due to entropic factors.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **multi-functionalized aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino and ether linkages** result in a **low yield**. Multiple functional groups can introduce steric hindrance and competition for metal coordination sites.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are derived from analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physico-chemical properties influencing the reaction yield. They combine multiple functional groups and structural features to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Proximal Functional Groups**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group enhance metal chelation.
  - **Aromatic Coordination Sites**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups at the para position provide additional coordination points.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Strong EWGs at the para position (excluding aldehydes) increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing metal binding.
  - **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles**: Heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms offer extra coordination sites.
  - **Hydrophobic Interactions**: Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without interfering groups may improve catalyst-framework interactions.
  - **Chelation within Conjugated Systems**: Functional groups capable of chelation within conjugated systems strengthen metal coordination.
  - **Polar Side Chains**: Amino acids with hydrophilic or polar side chains can form additional interactions with the metal center.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Distal Functional Groups**: Functional groups located far from the carboxyl group are less effective for chelation and may introduce steric hindrance.
  - **Perfluoroalkyl Chains**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects reduce carboxylate basicity, weakening coordination.
  - **Aldehyde Groups**: Aldehyde groups can interfere with coordination or participate in side reactions.
  - **Bulky Structures**: Sterically hindered modifiers reduce effective metal interaction.
  - **Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding**: Reduces availability of coordinating groups like hydroxyl or formyl groups.
  - **Amide Bonds**: Compete with carboxylate for metal coordination, decreasing catalyst effectiveness.
  - **Flexible Polyether Chains**: Increase steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination due to conformational flexibility.
  - **Multi-Functionalized Aliphatic Chains**: Multiple competing functional groups introduce steric and electronic complications.

By applying these rules, one can predict the potential effectiveness of a molecular modifier in enhancing the reaction yield. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity to capture key factors affecting the catalytic performance.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise the SMARTS pattern for Rule 4**. The current pattern `'[n][c,C]C(=O)[OX2H1]'` may be too restrictive and fails to match heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring. A more appropriate pattern would be `'[nH0;r5,r6][c,r5,r6]*C(=O)[O;H1]'`, which captures nitrogen-containing heterocycles bonded to a carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Update the implementation of Rule 4 in the code**. Ensure that the code correctly identifies heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring. Modify the matching process to account for various ring sizes and substitution patterns, and verify that the SMARTS pattern aligns with the examples provided in the rule.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 5**. The current pattern `'[CX4]([CH2])[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]C(=O)[OX2H1]'` may not accurately capture all aliphatic carboxylic acids with long alkyl chains (6-8 carbons). Consider using a more general pattern like `'CCCCCCC[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` to match carboxylic acids with 6 to 8 carbon chains without additional functional groups.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Incorporate exclusion of functional groups in Rule 5 correctly**. The code should verify that no additional functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol) are present in the molecule. Use SMARTS patterns to detect and exclude molecules containing these groups, ensuring that only suitable long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids are matched.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Review the implementation logic for Rule 3**. The code checks for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) but may not accurately place them at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group. Update the SMARTS patterns to ensure that nitro or bromoalkyl groups are correctly identified at the para position on the aromatic ring, and confirm that aldehyde groups are properly excluded.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Ensure consistent use of aromaticity in SMARTS patterns**. Aromatic rings should be specified consistently using lowercase 'c' and 'n' in SMARTS. Review all patterns involving aromatic systems to guarantee accurate matching, particularly for Rules 2 and 3.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Expand test cases to validate the rules**. Include additional SMILES strings known to match each rule's criteria to test whether the code correctly identifies them. This helps in verifying the effectiveness of the SMARTS patterns and the overall code logic.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Add error handling for molecules that cannot be parsed**. Modify the code to handle cases where `Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi)` returns `None`, providing informative messages or skipping invalid entries, rather than appending zeros without explanation.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Optimize the shortest path calculation in Rule 1**. Verify that the path length between the carboxylic acid carbon and the amino/thiol group considers all possible paths, accounting for branching in the aliphatic chain. Use atom mapping to ensure accurate distance measurements.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Document the code thoroughly**. Add comments explaining each step of the code, particularly the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and the logic within each rule's implementation. This improves readability and facilitates future code modifications.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) or thiol group (-SH) located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. The close proximity allows for effective chelation with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (amino group too distant)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (amide group reduces coordination)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) or hydroxyl group (-OH) at the para position** result in a **high yield**. These groups provide additional coordination sites, strengthening the interaction with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (short linker reduces flexibility)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (intramolecular hydrogen bonding interferes)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromoalkyl (-CH₂Br)** at the **para position**, excluding aldehyde groups, result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (aldehyde group can interfere with coordination)
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating group)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, improving catalyst efficiency.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (bulky structure causes steric hindrance)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long alkyl chains (6-8 carbons) without additional functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions within the catalyst framework.

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **Octanoic acid**

   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (distal amino group introduces steric hindrance)
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located **more than three carbons away** from the carboxyl group) result in a **low yield**. Distant functional groups are less effective for chelation and may introduce steric hindrance.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Example (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) or formyl groups attached to the ring** result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **bulky or sterically hindered structures** lead to a **low yield** due to decreased ability to coordinate with metal centers.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (rigid biphenyl structure)
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **functional groups capable of chelation (e.g., hydroxyl, ketone, or nitrogen atoms) within conjugated systems** result in a **high yield**. These groups enhance metal binding through multiple coordination sites.

    - **Examples (High Yield)**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces coordination)

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with hydrophilic or polar side chains capable of forming additional interactions** result in a **high yield**. Such side chains enhance binding to the metal center.

    - **Examples (High Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky, hydrophobic side chain)

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** due to **ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups** on aromatic rings result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of coordinating groups.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds or peptide linkages near the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. Amide groups can compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, reducing catalyst efficiency.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible polyether chains** result in a **low yield**. The steric bulk and flexibility hinder effective coordination due to entropic factors.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **multi-functionalized aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino and ether linkages** result in a **low yield**. Multiple functional groups can introduce steric hindrance and competition for metal coordination sites.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are derived from analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physico-chemical properties influencing the reaction yield. They combine multiple functional groups and structural features to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Proximal Functional Groups**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group enhance metal chelation.
  - **Aromatic Coordination Sites**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups at the para position provide additional coordination points.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Strong EWGs at the para position (excluding aldehydes) increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing metal binding.
  - **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles**: Heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms offer extra coordination sites.
  - **Hydrophobic Interactions**: Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without interfering groups may improve catalyst-framework interactions.
  - **Chelation within Conjugated Systems**: Functional groups capable of chelation within conjugated systems strengthen metal coordination.
  - **Polar Side Chains**: Amino acids with hydrophilic or polar side chains can form additional interactions with the metal center.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Distal Functional Groups**: Functional groups located far from the carboxyl group are less effective for chelation and may introduce steric hindrance.
  - **Perfluoroalkyl Chains**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects reduce carboxylate basicity, weakening coordination.
  - **Aldehyde Groups**: Aldehyde groups can interfere with coordination or participate in side reactions.
  - **Bulky Structures**: Sterically hindered modifiers reduce effective metal interaction.
  - **Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding**: Reduces availability of coordinating groups like hydroxyl or formyl groups.
  - **Amide Bonds**: Compete with carboxylate for metal coordination, decreasing catalyst effectiveness.
  - **Flexible Polyether Chains**: Increase steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination due to conformational flexibility.
  - **Multi-Functionalized Aliphatic Chains**: Multiple competing functional groups introduce steric and electronic complications.

By applying these rules, one can predict the potential effectiveness of a molecular modifier in enhancing the reaction yield. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity to capture key factors affecting the catalytic performance.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Implement Rule 11**: The current code does not implement Rule 11, which states that modifiers that are **amino acids with hydrophilic or polar side chains capable of forming additional interactions** result in a **high yield**. Add code to identify amino acids with polar side chains (e.g., Aspartic acid, Glutamic acid, Tryptophan) and assign a value of 1 when this rule is satisfied.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct Rule 3 Implementation**: The SMARTS patterns for Rule 3 may not fully capture all aromatic carboxylic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position, and the exclusion of aldehyde groups may not be correctly implemented. Ensure that the SMARTS patterns include other EWGs like nitro and bromoalkyl groups and that aldehyde groups are effectively excluded. Revise the patterns to match all intended EWGs and verify their positions on the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Review Distance Calculations in Rule 1 and Rule 6**: The method used to calculate distances between functional groups may not accurately reflect the number of carbons separating the groups. Modify the code to count the number of carbon atoms in the path between the functional groups rather than the total number of bonds, which may include heteroatoms or ring structures.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Enhance Rule 2 Pattern Matching**: The SMARTS pattern for Rule 2 should accurately detect amino or hydroxyl groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids. Verify that the current pattern matches compounds like **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**, and adjust the pattern if necessary to include cases where there are additional carbon atoms in the linker.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Adjust Rule 5 Exclusion Criteria**: In Rule 5, ensure that all additional functional groups are properly excluded. The current code may not exclude all possible interfering groups. Expand the exclusion patterns to include other functional groups such as halogens, esters, amides, or ethers that could be present on the alkyl chain.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Implement Rule 9 More Broadly**: The SMARTS pattern for Rule 9 may only identify specific bulky structures like biphenyls. Bulky or sterically hindered structures can be more diverse. Consider using molecular descriptors like molar volume or steric parameters, or include additional SMARTS patterns to capture a wider range of bulky groups.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Improve Rule 10 Pattern for Chelation in Conjugated Systems**: The current pattern for Rule 10 may not capture all functional groups capable of chelation within conjugated systems. Extend the SMARTS pattern to include ketone groups, nitrogen atoms, and other chelating functionalities in conjugated systems, and verify that examples like **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** are matched.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Verify Rule 12 Pattern for Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding**: Ensure that the SMARTS pattern for Rule 12 correctly identifies ortho-substituted hydroxyl or formyl groups on aromatic rings. The pattern should account for both hydroxyl and formyl groups positioned ortho to the carboxyl group and their potential to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Enhance Error Handling and Reporting**: Modify the code to include error handling for molecules that cannot be parsed or if unexpected exceptions occur during pattern matching. Provide informative messages or logs to facilitate troubleshooting.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Thoroughly Test and Validate the Code**: For each rule, create test cases with known compounds that should match or not match the rule. Compare the code's output with expected results to validate the accuracy of the rule implementations. Adjust the code based on the testing outcomes.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Refine the Rules to Use Quantifiable Structural Descriptors**

  Replace subjective terms like "bulky," "sterically hindered," "proximal," and "distal" with quantifiable molecular descriptors. For example, specify the exact number of carbon atoms separating functional groups (e.g., "functional group located at the α, β, or γ carbon") or use measurable parameters such as molecular weight, topological polar surface area (tPSA), or steric hindrance indices.

- **Advice 2**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**

  Merge rules that cover similar structural features to reduce redundancy and enhance clarity. For instance, combine rules related to electron-withdrawing groups (Rules 3 and 7) and those involving functional groups capable of chelation (Rules 1, 2, 4, and 10) to create broader, more generalizable rules.

- **Advice 3**: **Align Rules with Easily Extractable SMILES Features**

  Ensure that each rule corresponds to structural features that can be directly identified from SMILES strings. Focus on functional groups, ring systems, substitution patterns, and connectivity that are easily parsed computationally.

- **Advice 4**: **Provide Specific Functional Group Definitions**

  Clearly define functional groups and their positions using standard chemical nomenclature. For example, specify "para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 4 relative to the carboxyl group."

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Quantitative Thresholds Where Applicable**

  Introduce numerical thresholds for properties like chain length, electron-withdrawing strength (Hammett sigma constants), or steric parameters (Taft steric constants). This aids in converting rules into numerical features for modeling.

- **Advice 6**: **Use Binary Indicators for Functional Groups**

  For each functional group or structural motif identified in the rules, create a binary feature indicating its presence or absence. This facilitates the generation of a numerical feature matrix suitable for machine learning models.

- **Advice 7**: **Reassess and Update Rules Based on Data Discrepancies**

  Review the dataset for instances where the rules do not predict the yield accurately (e.g., tryptophan yielding high despite being bulky). Adjust the rules to account for exceptions or refine them to improve their predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 8**: **Add Rules for Unaddressed Structural Features**

  Identify any structural features in the dataset not covered by the current rules but influencing the yield. For example, consider the impact of aromaticity, heteroatoms other than nitrogen, or specific ring sizes.

- **Advice 9**: **Provide Examples with Corresponding SMILES**

  Include representative examples for each rule accompanied by their SMILES notation. This assists in verifying that the rules can be applied directly to SMILES strings and aids in computational implementation.

- **Advice 10**: **Develop a Standardized Workflow for Feature Extraction**

  Create a standardized procedure or algorithm for converting the refined rules into numerical features from SMILES strings. This may involve specifying software tools or scripts that can automate the feature extraction process.

      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky, hydrophobic side chain)

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that have **multiple ether linkages and flexible chains** result in a **low yield**. The increased conformational flexibility reduces the effective concentration of coordinating groups at the metal center.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **additional chelating groups within conjugated systems** (e.g., ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings) result in a **high yield**. These groups strengthen metal coordination through bidentate or multidentate interactions.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules combine multiple functional groups and structural features to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Proximal Amino or Thiol Groups**: Enhance chelation with metal centers.
  - **Aromatic Rings with Para Substituents**: Amino or hydroxyl groups increase coordination sites.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing metal binding.
  - **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles**: Provide additional coordination sites.
  - **Simple Aliphatic Chains**: Lack of hindering groups allows better interaction with the catalyst.
  - **Polar Side Chains in Amino Acids**: Enhance metal coordination.
  - **Chelating Groups in Conjugated Systems**: Strengthen binding through multidentate interactions.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Distal Functional Groups**: Reduce effective chelation and may introduce steric hindrance.
  - **Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding**: Decreases availability of coordination sites.
  - **Perfluoroalkyl Chains**: Weaken metal coordination.
  - **Bulky Structures**: Impede effective coordination due to steric hindrance.
  - **Amide Bonds Near Carboxyl Group**: Compete for metal coordination.
  - **Flexible Ether Chains**: Reduce effective concentration of coordinating groups.

These rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity. They consider underlying physico-chemical properties such as coordination ability, steric effects, electron-withdrawing or donating nature, and the potential for chelation with the metal center. By applying these rules, we can predict the potential effectiveness of a molecular modifier in enhancing the reaction yield.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) or thiol group (-SH) located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. The proximity of these functional groups enhances chelation with metal centers, improving catalytic activity.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (functional group too distant)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) group directly attached to the ring** result in a **high yield**. These groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (short linker reduces flexibility)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (interfering amide linkage)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (-NO₂, -CH₂Br)** result in a **high yield**, as EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing coordination with metals.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (aldehyde may interfere)
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating group)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring** result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, enhancing catalyst efficiency.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (bulky structure causes steric hindrance)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups** (functional groups located more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group) result in a **low yield**. The distance reduces effective chelation, and additional groups may introduce steric hindrance.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups** result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of coordinating groups.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups near the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
     - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **bulky or sterically hindered groups near the coordination site** result in a **low yield** due to decreased ability to coordinate with metal centers.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (rigid biphenyl structure)
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds or peptide linkages adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. Amide groups can compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups or with long hydrophobic chains** result in a **high yield**. The lack of interfering groups and hydrophobic interactions may enhance catalyst performance.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **Octanoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with polar or chelating side chains** (e.g., carboxylate, thiol, indole ring) result in a **high yield**. These functionalities enhance coordination with the metal center.

    - **Examples (High Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky, hydrophobic side chain)

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that have **multiple ether linkages and flexible chains** result in a **low yield**. The increased conformational flexibility reduces the effective concentration of coordinating groups at the metal center.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **additional chelating groups within conjugated systems** (e.g., ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings) result in a **high yield**. These groups strengthen metal coordination through bidentate or multidentate interactions.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules combine multiple functional groups and structural features to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Proximal Amino or Thiol Groups**: Enhance chelation with metal centers.
  - **Aromatic Rings with Para Substituents**: Amino or hydroxyl groups increase coordination sites.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing metal binding.
  - **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles**: Provide additional coordination sites.
  - **Simple Aliphatic Chains**: Lack of hindering groups allows better interaction with the catalyst.
  - **Polar Side Chains in Amino Acids**: Enhance metal coordination.
  - **Chelating Groups in Conjugated Systems**: Strengthen binding through multidentate interactions.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Distal Functional Groups**: Reduce effective chelation and may introduce steric hindrance.
  - **Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding**: Decreases availability of coordination sites.
  - **Perfluoroalkyl Chains**: Weaken metal coordination.
  - **Bulky Structures**: Impede effective coordination due to steric hindrance.
  - **Amide Bonds Near Carboxyl Group**: Compete for metal coordination.
  - **Flexible Ether Chains**: Reduce effective concentration of coordinating groups.

These rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity. They consider underlying physico-chemical properties such as coordination ability, steric effects, electron-withdrawing or donating nature, and the potential for chelation with the metal center. By applying these rules, we can predict the potential effectiveness of a molecular modifier in enhancing the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 1** - Modify the code to ensure that the carboxylic acid is aliphatic and not attached to an aromatic ring. Currently, the code does not differentiate between aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, possibly leading to false positives. Update the SMARTS pattern for carboxylic acids to exclude aromatic carbons:

  ```python
  carboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[C;!Ar][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: **Rule 1** - Ensure that the path length calculation correctly represents "within three carbons" by adjusting the bond count. The current code uses up to 5 bonds, which may not accurately reflect three carbons in between. Since each carbon-carbon bond counts as one bond, and we have to include the bonds from the carboxyl carbon to the alpha carbon, adjust the path length to:

  ```python
  if 0 < len(path) - 1 <= 4:  # up to 4 bonds (3 carbons in between)
  ```

- **Suggestion 3**: **Rule 2** - Refine the SMARTS patterns to explicitly enforce that the amino or hydroxyl group and the carboxylic acid are para to each other on the aromatic ring. The current patterns may match ortho or meta substitutions. Update the SMARTS to:

  ```python
  para_amino = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(N)cc1C(=O)[O,H]')
  para_hydroxyl = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(O)cc1C(=O)[O,H]')
  ```

- **Suggestion 4**: **Rule 2** - Ensure that the carboxylic acid is directly attached to the aromatic ring. In the code, the carboxylic acid may not be explicitly connected to the ring. Modify the SMARTS patterns to connect the carboxyl group directly to the ring atom:

  ```python
  para_amino = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1[NH2])C(=O)[O,H]')
  ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **Rule 3** - Adjust the SMARTS patterns to capture other electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) specified in the rule, like -NO₂ and -CH₂Br, and ensure they are para-substituted. Update the patterns to:

  ```python
  para_no2 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1C(=O)[O,H]')
  para_ch2br = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(CBr)cc1C(=O)[O,H]')
  ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **Rule 4** - Modify the SMARTS pattern to ensure it matches heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms within the ring. The current pattern may not capture all relevant heterocycles. Use a more general SMARTS:

  ```python
  hetero_carboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[nH0,c]1[n,c][n,c][n,c][n,c]1C(=O)[O,H]')
  ```

- **Suggestion 7**: **Rule 5** - Adjust the path length in the code to accurately reflect "functional groups located more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group." Currently, it uses a bond length greater than 5, but it should consider distances greater than 6 bonds (three carbons between functional group and carboxyl group plus two bonds for the functional group and carboxyl group themselves):

  ```python
  if len(path) - 1 > 6:  # More than 6 bonds
  ```

- **Suggestion 8**: **Rule 6** - Correct the SMARTS patterns for ortho-substituted hydroxyl or formyl groups. The current patterns may not accurately represent ortho substitution. Use:

  ```python
  ortho_hydroxyl = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1c(O)cccc1C(=O)[O,H]')
  ortho_formyl = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1c(C=O)cccc1C(=O)[O,H]')
  ```

- **Suggestion 9**: **Rule 7** - Expand the SMARTS patterns to include perfluoroalkyl chains and trifluoromethyl groups near the carboxyl group in various positions. The current patterns are too specific. Use a more general pattern:

  ```python
  perfluoroalkyl = Chem.MolFromSmarts('C(F)(F)(F)C(F)(F)[CX4]C(=O)[O,H]')
  trifluoromethyl = Chem.MolFromSmarts('C(F)(F)(F)[CX4]C(=O)[O,H]')
  ```

- **Suggestion 10**: **Rule 8** - Modify the SMARTS pattern to more accurately represent bulky or sterically hindered groups near the coordination site. Include additional bulky groups such as tert-butyl or phenyl groups:

  ```python
  bulky_group = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[C,c][C](C(=O)[O,H])[C](C)(C)C')  # Example for tert-butyl
  ```

- **Suggestion 11**: **Rule 9** - Adjust the SMARTS pattern to match amide bonds or peptide linkages adjacent to the carboxyl group more accurately. The current pattern may miss some cases. Use:

  ```python
  amide_adjacent = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3][CX3](=O)[CX3H1][C](=O)[O,H]')
  ```

- **Suggestion 12**: **Rule 10** - Generalize the SMARTS pattern to match simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains, not just octanoic acid. Use a pattern that matches carboxylic acids with chains longer than a certain length without additional functional groups:

  ```python
  simple_aliphatic = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CH3][CH2]{5,}[C](=O)[O,H]')
  ```

- **Suggestion 13**: **Rule 11** - Include other amino acids with polar or chelating side chains in the SMARTS patterns. Instead of specific amino acids, use a general pattern for amino acids with side chains containing functional groups like -OH, -SH, or additional -COOH groups:

  ```python
  polar_amino_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('N[C@@H](C[CX4,O,N,S])[C](=O)[O,H]')
  ```

- **Suggestion 14**: **Rule 12** - Adjust the SMARTS pattern for multiple ether linkages to capture flexible polyether chains more generally. The current pattern may be too specific. Use:

  ```python
  polyether = Chem.MolFromSmarts('O(CCO)COC(=O)[O,H]')
  ```

- **Suggestion 15**: **Rule 13** - Expand the SMARTS pattern to match modifiers with additional chelating groups within conjugated systems more broadly. The current pattern is specific to one compound. Use a pattern that captures conjugated systems with chelating groups:

  ```python
  conjugated_chelator = Chem.MolFromSmarts('O=C[C;R1]=[C;R1]C(=O)[O,H]')
  ```

- **Suggestion 16**: **General** - Implement aromaticity and ring checks where necessary using RDKit's aromaticity perception and ring membership functions to ensure accurate matching for aromatic and heterocyclic compounds.

- **Suggestion 17**: **Error Handling** - In each rule's `try` block, include logging of exceptions to help debug any potential issues during the matching process.

- **Suggestion 18**: **Testing** - Create unit tests for each rule using the example and non-example compounds provided to ensure that the SMARTS patterns and code modifications accurately capture the intended rules.

  - Rule 8: 0.0074

- **Average Train Leverage:**
  - \[(0.0163 + 0.0065 + 0.0128 + (-0.0039) + 0.0021 + 0.0060 + 0.0078 + 0.0074) / 8 = 0.0069\]

**Comparison:**

- **Decrease:** The current average train leverage (0.0069) is slightly lower than the previous average (0.0124), suggesting that the rules provide less additional information over chance than before.

---

### **Summary of Findings**

- **Higher Confidence and Lift:** The current rules have improved in terms of confidence and lift, meaning they are better at predicting high yields when they apply.
  
- **Lower Support:** The decrease in support indicates that the rules now apply to fewer cases in the dataset. This could be due to the rules being more specific.

- **Mixed Leverage Results:** The slight decrease in leverage suggests a modest reduction in the practical significance of the rules.

- **Underperforming Rule:** Notably, **Rule 4** has a **lift below 1 (0.9120)** and a **negative leverage (-0.0039)**, indicating that it is not effectively predicting high yields and may be counterproductive.

---

**Assessment of Iterations and Local Minimum**

- **Local Minimum Not Reached:** The presence of an underperforming rule and decreased support suggests that further improvements can be made. The model may not have reached a local minimum yet.
  
- **Need for More Iterations:** The current iteration shows improvements in certain areas but also introduces issues that need addressing. Additional iterations are necessary to refine the rules.

---

### **Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Re-evaluate Underperforming Rules**

   - **Rule 4:** Since it has a lift less than 1 and negative leverage, consider removing or revising this rule. Investigate whether the structural features in this rule truly contribute to high yields or are associated with low yields.
   - **Action:** Analyze the data associated with Rule 4 to determine the cause of poor performance. Adjust the rule's conditions or remove it if necessary.

2. **Balance Specificity and Coverage**

   - **Increase Support:** To make the rules more practically useful, aim to increase the support without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
   - **Action:** Generalize overly specific rules slightly to cover more data points. Merge similar rules where possible to create broader rules with higher support.

3. **Optimize Confidence and Lift**

   - **Maintain High Confidence and Lift:** While increasing support, ensure that confidence and lift remain high to keep the rules predictive.
   - **Action:** Identify key structural features that consistently contribute to high yields and prioritize them in the rules.

4. **Incorporate Test Metrics**

   - **Evaluate on Test Data:** The current metrics are solely on the training data. Assessing the rules on test data can reveal overfitting.
   - **Action:** Calculate test confidence and lift for the current rules to ensure they generalize well to unseen data.

5. **Analyze Correlations and Feature Importance**

   - **Data-Driven Refinement:** Use statistical methods to discover strong predictors of high yield, such as correlation coefficients and feature importance scores.
   - **Action:** Adjust rules to emphasize features with strong positive correlations to high yields.

6. **Iterative Rule Refinement**

   - **Continuous Improvement:** Since a local minimum has not been reached, continue refining the rules in subsequent iterations.
   - **Action:** Implement the recommended changes and re-evaluate the metrics. Repeat this process until improvements plateau.

7. **Consult Domain Expertise**

   - **Leverage Chemical Knowledge:** Collaborate with chemists to validate the plausibility of the rules based on chemical principles.
   - **Action:** Adjust rules that may not make sense chemically, even if metrics suggest they are predictive, to ensure practical applicability.

8. **Consider Rule Interaction Effects**

   - **Multi-Rule Synergies:** Explore whether combinations of rules interact to improve predictions.
   - **Action:** Analyze interactions between rules and consider creating composite rules that capture these effects.

9. **Address Overfitting Concerns**

   - **Watch for Overfitting:** The decrease in support and high confidence may indicate overfitting to the training data.
   - **Action:** Simplify rules where possible and validate them against test data to ensure they are not too tailored to the training set.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules show promising improvements in confidence and lift but suffer from reduced support and an underperforming rule. By addressing these issues through careful refinement and validation, the rules can be enhanced to provide more robust and generalizable predictions. Continuing the iterative process of analysis and adjustment will help in reaching an optimal set of rules that balance accuracy, applicability, and practical significance.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results and the provided metrics, the current rules appear to be less effective than previous iterations. Here's a summary of the performance comparison:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies**:
  - Consistently around **0.76**.
  - Test accuracies at **0.75** and **0.625**.

- **Current Validation Accuracy**:
  - **0.6286**, which is significantly lower than the previous validation accuracies.

This decrease in accuracy suggests that the current rules are not performing as well as before. The model's ability to correctly predict the loading of the modifier on the catalyst has deteriorated, indicating potential issues with the current set of rules.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Overfitting**: The model may be overfitting if it performs well on the training data but poorly on validation data. However, the validation accuracy is low, which does not strongly suggest overfitting.
- **Underfitting**: The low validation accuracy indicates that the model might be underfitting, meaning it's too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.

Given that the validation accuracy has decreased, it's likely that the current rules are not capturing essential features needed to make accurate predictions, leading to underfitting.

**Analysis of SHAP Values and Discrepancies**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into which rules contribute most significantly to the model's predictions. By examining instances where the model's predictions do not match the experimental values, we can identify problematic rules.

1. **Cases with Predicted High Loading but Experimental Low Loading**:
   - **Molecule**: *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
     - **Predicted**: High loading
     - **Experimental**: Low loading
     - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
       - **Rule 7**: SHAP value = 0.04585
       - **Rule 12**: SHAP value = 0.03445
       - **Rule 13**: SHAP value = 0.05606
   - **Molecule**: *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O*
     - **Predicted**: High loading
     - **Experimental**: Low loading
     - **Same rules with high SHAP values as above**.

   **Interpretation**: *Rule 7*, *Rule 12*, and *Rule 13* are contributing significantly to the overestimation of the loading for these molecules.

2. **Cases with Predicted Low Loading but Experimental High Loading**:
   - **Molecule**: *C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O*
     - **Predicted**: Low loading
     - **Experimental**: High loading
     - **Rules with High Negative SHAP Values**:
       - **Rule 4**: SHAP value = -0.29999
   - **Molecule**: *C(COCCOCCN)C(=O)O*
     - **Predicted**: Low loading
     - **Experimental**: High loading
     - **Rule with High Negative SHAP Value**:
       - **Rule 10**: SHAP value = -0.55672

   **Interpretation**: *Rule 4* and *Rule 10* are contributing significantly to the underestimation of the loading for these molecules.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the modifications made to the rules in the current iteration did not improve the model's performance. In fact, the performance has declined compared to previous iterations. This could indicate that the current rules are:

- **Too Simplistic**: Not capturing the complexity of the data.
- **Overly Complex**: Leading to conflicting decisions and reducing generalization.
- **Misaligned**: Not properly representing the key features that determine the modifier loading.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the effectiveness of the current rules and improve model performance, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values in Overestimations**:

   - **Rule 7**:
     - **Current Description**: Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups near the carboxyl group result in a low yield.
     - **Issue**: Rule 7 is contributing positively to the prediction of high loading for molecules that experimentally have low loading.
     - **Recommendation**: Re-evaluate Rule 7 to ensure it accurately captures the effect of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). Since EWGs can both decrease or increase yield depending on the context, consider specifying the position and nature of the substituents more precisely.

   - **Rule 12**:
     - **Current Description**: Modifiers that have multiple ether linkages and flexible chains result in a low yield.
     - **Issue**: Despite being associated with low yield, Rule 12 is contributing to high loading predictions.
     - **Recommendation**: Adjust Rule 12 to better reflect its intended impact. Possibly revise the rule to include exceptions or clarify the types of ether linkages that lead to low yield.

   - **Rule 13**:
     - **Current Description**: Modifiers with additional chelating groups within conjugated systems result in a high yield.
     - **Issue**: Rule 13 may be too broad, leading to over-predictions of high loading.
     - **Recommendation**: Narrow down Rule 13 by specifying the types of conjugated systems and chelating groups that positively influence the yield. Consider any steric hindrance or electronic effects that may negate the positive impact.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations**:

   - **Rule 4**:
     - **Current Description**: Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring result in a high yield.
     - **Issue**: Rule 4 is associated with a high negative SHAP value in cases where the model underestimates the loading.
     - **Recommendation**: Review Rule 4 to ensure it adequately captures the beneficial effects of nitrogen heterocycles. Consider expanding the rule to include a wider variety of heterocyclic structures or adding more examples to reinforce the rule.

   - **Rule 10**:
     - **Current Description**: Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups or with long hydrophobic chains result in a high yield.
     - **Issue**: Rule 10 is negatively impacting the prediction of high loading for certain molecules.
     - **Recommendation**: Clarify Rule 10 by defining the optimal chain length for hydrophobic interactions. There may be a point where increased chain length no longer contributes positively due to solubility issues or steric effects.

3. **Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting**:

   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: Some rules may be too specific, causing the model to underfit. Generalize these rules where appropriate to cover more molecules.
   - **Combine Similar Rules**: If multiple rules overlap significantly, consider merging them to reduce redundancy and confusion.
   - **Include More Examples**: Enhance the rules with additional examples and non-examples to provide clearer guidance to the model.

4. **Incorporate Additional Physicochemical Properties**:

   - **Electronic Effects**: Reassess how electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups are represented in the rules.
   - **Steric Factors**: Consider the impact of steric hindrance in more detail, possibly introducing new rules that address bulky substituents more precisely.
   - **Hydrogen Bonding**: Evaluate the role of hydrogen bonding in modifier effectiveness, as it may affect coordination with the metal center.

5. **Use Insights from SHAP Analysis to Refine Rules**:

   - **Identify Patterns**: Look for patterns in the SHAP values across multiple molecules to pinpoint systemic issues with specific rules.
   - **Iteratively Test Adjustments**: After modifying the rules, retrain the model and observe changes in SHAP values and accuracy to determine if the adjustments lead to improvements.
   - **Avoid Conflicting Rules**: Ensure that the adjusted rules do not conflict with each other, which can confuse the model and reduce accuracy.

**Conclusion**

By carefully analyzing the performance metrics and SHAP values, it's evident that certain rules are contributing to mispredictions. Focusing on refining these problematic rules, addressing underfitting issues, and improving the generalization of the model should enhance its predictive accuracy. Iterative testing and continuous refinement based on SHAP analysis will help in developing a more robust and effective set of rules for predicting modifier loading on catalysts.

   - **Decreased Support**: The average train support decreased from 0.1756 to 0.0629, suggesting that the rules now apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.
   - **Underperforming Rule**: Rule 4 has a lift less than 1 (0.9120) and negative leverage (-0.0039), indicating it is not effectively predicting high yields.

2. **Validation Accuracy Decline**:
   - Validation accuracy decreased to **0.6286** from previous values around **0.76**, signifying a reduction in the model's overall predictive performance.

3. **SHAP Analysis Insights**:
   - **Overestimations**: Rules 7, 12, and 13 contribute to incorrect predictions of high loading in cases where the experimental loading is low.
   - **Underestimations**: Rules 4 and 10 contribute to incorrect predictions of low loading in cases where the experimental loading is high.

**Suggestions to Improve the Current Rules**

To optimize the current rules and enhance the model's performance, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Refine Underperforming Rules**:
   - **Rule 4**:
     - **Issue**: It underperforms with a lift below 1 and negative leverage.
     - **Action**: Re-evaluate the structural features captured by Rule 4. Investigate whether the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids truly contribute to high yield. Adjust the rule's conditions or remove it if it's not predictive.

2. **Adjust Rules Contributing to Misclassifications**:
   - **Rule 7**:
     - **Issue**: It contributes positively to incorrect high loading predictions.
     - **Action**: Reassess the impact of electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains. Specify the positions and nature of these groups more precisely to capture their true effect on yield.

    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky, hydrophobic side chain)

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that have **multiple ether linkages and flexible chains** result in a **low yield**. The increased conformational flexibility reduces the effective concentration of coordinating groups at the metal center.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **additional chelating groups within conjugated systems** (e.g., ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings) result in a **high yield**. These groups strengthen metal coordination through bidentate or multidentate interactions.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules combine multiple functional groups and structural features to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield:

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Proximal Amino or Thiol Groups**: Enhance chelation with metal centers.
  - **Aromatic Rings with Para Substituents**: Amino or hydroxyl groups increase coordination sites.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing metal binding.
  - **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles**: Provide additional coordination sites.
  - **Simple Aliphatic Chains**: Lack of hindering groups allows better interaction with the catalyst.
  - **Polar Side Chains in Amino Acids**: Enhance metal coordination.
  - **Chelating Groups in Conjugated Systems**: Strengthen binding through multidentate interactions.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Distal Functional Groups**: Reduce effective chelation and may introduce steric hindrance.
  - **Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding**: Decreases availability of coordination sites.
  - **Perfluoroalkyl Chains**: Weaken metal coordination.
  - **Bulky Structures**: Impede effective coordination due to steric hindrance.
  - **Amide Bonds Near Carboxyl Group**: Compete for metal coordination.
  - **Flexible Ether Chains**: Reduce effective concentration of coordinating groups.

These rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity. They consider underlying physico-chemical properties such as coordination ability, steric effects, electron-withdrawing or donating nature, and the potential for chelation with the metal center. By applying these rules, we can predict the potential effectiveness of a molecular modifier in enhancing the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 4** to improve its predictive performance. Modify the rule to specify that only small heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in rings of five or six members and without bulky substituents result in high yield. Exclude larger or fused heterocycles and those with steric hindrance near the coordination site.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust Rule 7** to accurately reflect the impact of electron-withdrawing groups. Revise the rule to specify that perfluoroalkyl chains and trifluoromethyl groups directly attached to the carboxyl carbon result in low yield. Ensure the SMARTS patterns correctly identify these groups and consider excluding compounds where these groups are positioned further from the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 3**: **Revise Rule 12** to prevent incorrect high yield predictions. Update the rule to specify that modifiers with three or more ether linkages in flexible aliphatic chains result in low yield. Clarify that shorter chains or fewer ether linkages may not have the same negative effect, reducing overgeneralization.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rule 13** to avoid overpredicting high yield. Narrow the rule to include only conjugated systems where the chelating groups (e.g., ketones, hydroxyls) are in positions that facilitate effective bidentate coordination without causing steric hindrance. Exclude bulky conjugated systems or those with interfering functional groups.

- **Advice 5**: **Update SMARTS patterns** across all rules to improve matching accuracy. Review and correct the code implementing the SMARTS patterns to ensure that all functional groups and structural features are accurately captured. For example, in Rule 1, ensure that aliphatic carboxylic acids are correctly identified by excluding aromatic carbons, and in Rule 2, enforce para-substitution on aromatic rings.

- **Advice 6**: **Simplify and merge overlapping rules** to increase support without compromising confidence. Identify rules with similar structural features, such as Rules 1 and 11, and combine them to create broader, more general rules that still maintain high predictive power.

- **Advice 7**: **Increase rule support** by generalizing specific conditions where appropriate. Expand rules to include additional functional groups that have similar effects on yield, such as including proximal hydroxyl groups in Rule 1 if they enhance chelation. Ensure that the generalization does not significantly reduce the confidence and lift of the rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Continuously validate and refine the rules** using performance metrics and SHAP analysis. After each modification, assess the impact on training and validation accuracy, lift, and confidence. Use SHAP values to identify and correct rules that contribute to misclassifications, ensuring the rules do not overfit the training data.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **
- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify Functional Group Positions**\
  Modify the rules to specify the exact position of functional groups relative to the carboxyl group in a way that can be numerically represented. For instance, instead of saying "within three carbons," specify the number of bonds between the carboxyl carbon and the functional group. This allows for the creation of a numeric feature (e.g., distance = 1, 2, 3, etc.) directly from the SMILES string.

- **Advice 2**: **Use Binary Indicators for Specific Functional Groups**\
  Assign binary variables to represent the presence or absence of key functional groups and structural features identified in the rules. For example:
  - Amino group present near carboxyl group: 1 (yes), 0 (no)
  - Hydroxyl group within a certain distance: 1 or 0
  - Aromatic ring present: 1 or 0
  This approach simplifies the generation of a numeric feature matrix from SMILES data.

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify Electronic Effects Using Descriptors**\
  Incorporate numerical electronic descriptors such as Hammett sigma constants or calculated partial charges to represent electron-donating or electron-withdrawing effects of substituents. This enables the translation of electronic effects into quantifiable features.

- **Advice 4**: **Define Steric Hindrance Numerically**\
  Quantify steric effects by calculating molecular descriptors related to steric bulk, such as the molar refractivity, Verloop steric parameters, or simply the count of heavy atoms in substituents adjacent to coordination sites. This provides a numeric basis for rules related to steric hindrance.

- **Advice 5**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules into Broad Categories**\
  Merge similar rules to reduce complexity and redundancy. For example, combine Rules 1, 7, and 11 into a single rule focusing on modifiers with proximal chelating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxylate groups) enhancing yield. This unified rule can then be expressed using quantifiable features.

- **Advice 6**: **Utilize Molecular Descriptors from Cheminformatics Tools**\
  Employ cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit, ChemAxon) to calculate a set of molecular descriptors for each compound. These descriptors can include topological indices, geometric descriptors, and electronic properties, which facilitate the generation of a comprehensive numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 7**: **Encode Ring Systems and Heterocycles Numerically**\
  Translate the presence and type of ring systems (aromatic, heterocyclic) into numeric features. For example:
  - Number of aromatic rings: integer count
  - Presence of nitrogen in ring: 1 or 0
  - Size of the ring system: number of atoms
  This quantification aids in representing rules related to aromatic and heterocyclic effects on yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Establish a Scoring System for Predictive Modeling**\
  Develop a weighted scoring system where each key feature contributes to an overall score predicting high or low yield. Assign weights based on the significance of each feature as observed in the dataset. This approach helps in creating a predictive model that numerically correlates with the reaction yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Distance Measurements in the Molecular Graph**\
  Use the molecular graph derived from the SMILES string to calculate the shortest path lengths between functional groups (e.g., carboxyl group to amino group). These distances can be used as numeric features to represent proximity effects outlined in the rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Represent Flexibility and Chain Length Numerically**\
  Quantify chain flexibility and length by calculating parameters such as the number of rotatable bonds and the total aliphatic chain length. This allows for numerical representation of rules related to flexible ether chains and aliphatic chain effects on yield.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Descriptors**  
  Revise the current rules to focus on molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. For instance, instead of describing modifiers qualitatively (e.g., "Modifiers with amino groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group"), define features such as "Number of amino groups within a three-carbon radius of the carboxyl group." This allows for numeric quantification and easier feature matrix generation.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize SMARTS Patterns for Substructure Matching**  
  Convert structural features described in the rules into SMARTS patterns that can be used to search for specific substructures within molecules. This enables automated detection of these features using cheminformatics tools like RDKit, facilitating the creation of binary or count-based numerical features.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Standard Molecular Descriptors**  
  Include standard computed descriptors such as molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and rotatable bonds. These features are easily calculated from SMILES and can capture properties related to steric hindrance, hydrophobicity, and hydrogen bonding potential.

- **Advice 4**: **Quantify Electronic Effects Using Hammett Constants**  
  Replace qualitative descriptions of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups with quantitative parameters like Hammett sigma constants (σ). Assign numerical values to substituents based on their electronic nature (e.g., nitro groups have high positive σ values), enabling numerical modeling of electronic effects on yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Measure Steric Hindrance with Steric Parameters**  
  Quantify steric effects using parameters such as molar refractivity or Verloop steric parameters. These values can numerically represent the bulkiness of substituents adjacent to coordination sites, providing a way to model steric hindrance quantitatively.

- **Advice 6**: **Compute Coordination Numbers and Donor Atom Counts**  
  Include features that count the number of potential donor atoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) and their capacity to coordinate with the metal center. This addresses the rules related to chelation and multidentate ligands in a numerical manner.

- **Advice 7**: **Calculate Distance Metrics Between Functional Groups**  
  Implement features that measure the topological distance between functional groups (e.g., number of bonds between the carboxyl group and amino/hydroxyl/thiol groups). This directly quantifies proximities that are important in the rules for high yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Assess Molecular Flexibility and Conformation**  
  Use descriptors like the number of rotatable bonds or flexibility indices to quantify molecular flexibility, which affects effective coordination. This addresses rules concerning long aliphatic chains and flexible ether linkages leading to low yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Simplify and Consolidate Redundant Rules**  
  Review the current rules to identify and merge overlapping or similar rules. For example, combine rules about electron-withdrawing groups (Rules 2 and 7) into a single rule focusing on substituent effects quantified by electronic descriptors. This streamlines the rule set and reduces complexity.

- **Advice 10**: **Focus on Physicochemical Properties Over Specific Functional Groups**  
  Shift from specific functional group mentions to broader physicochemical property ranges. For instance, instead of specifying "Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains," use "Modifiers with high electron-withdrawing capacity (e.g., high electronegativity substituents)." This makes the rules more general and easier to quantify.

- **Advice 11**: **Implement Machine Learning Feature Selection**  
  After calculating a comprehensive set of descriptors, apply feature selection techniques (e.g., recursive feature elimination, mutual information) to identify the most relevant features influencing yield. This data-driven approach can uncover important predictors that align with or refine existing rules.

- **Advice 12**: **Create a Feature Generation Protocol**  
  Develop a standardized protocol for feature extraction from SMILES, ensuring consistency across all modifiers. Document the computational methods and parameters used to calculate each descriptor, facilitating reproducibility and clarity in how the features relate to the rules.

- **Advice 13**: **Validate and Adjust Rules Based on Data Analysis**  
  Perform statistical analysis and model fitting using the new numerical features to validate the existing rules. If certain descriptors do not correlate well with yield, consider refining the rules or descriptors accordingly. This iterative process ensures that the rules are data-driven and robust.

- **Advice 14**: **Use Structural Alerts for High and Low Yield Predictions**  
  Identify key substructures or motifs associated with high or low yields and create structural alert features. For example, binary flags indicating the presence of certain rings or functional groups can serve as straightforward features in the numeric matrix.

- **Advice 15**: **Incorporate 3D Molecular Descriptors if Relevant**  
  If three-dimensional interactions are significant, include 3D descriptors such as partial charges, molecular volume, and shape descriptors. These can be calculated using computational chemistry software and may capture effects not evident from 2D structures alone.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), or thiol (-SH) groups located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. The close proximity of these polar groups enhances chelation with the metal center, improving catalyst performance.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Amino group too distant)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group too distant)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups** such as **nitro (-NO₂), bromo (-Br), or amino (-NH₂)** result in a **high yield**. These groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate and enhance coordination with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Para methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde may interfere with coordination)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring**, especially **pyridine or pyrazole rings**, result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Bulky structure causes steric hindrance)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups** result in a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups enhance chelation and coordination with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group too distant)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (more than six carbons) where functional groups are more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The distance reduces effective chelation and may introduce flexibility that hinders coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (High yield despite long chain due to lack of interfering groups)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups** such as **methyl (-CH₃), methoxy (-OCH₃), or hydroxyl (-OH)** result in a **low yield**. These groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, reducing coordination efficiency.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Electron-withdrawing group enhances yield)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **bulky or sterically hindering groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **phenyl rings or large substituents**, result in a **low yield** due to decreased ability to coordinate with metal centers.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **fluorinated alkyl chains near the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
     - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **functional groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** with the carboxylate group, such as **ortho-hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups**, result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of coordinating groups for metal binding.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Para-hydroxyl group does not facilitate intramolecular hydrogen bonding)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains capable of π-interactions** (e.g., **indole rings**) result in a **high yield**. The aromatic side chains can participate in additional coordination or stabilization through π-stacking interactions with the metal center.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

**Summary and Justification:**

These rules are designed to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. They combine multiple substructures and functional groups, considering underlying physico-chemical properties to explain their effects on yield.

- **High Yield Modifiers**:

  - **Proximal Polar Groups**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups within three carbons enhance chelation (Rule 1).
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Para Substituents**: Increase carboxylate acidity and coordination ability in aromatic acids (Rule 2).
  - **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles**: Provide additional coordination sites (Rule 3).
  - **Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups**: Enhance chelation through multiple coordinating sites (Rule 4).
  - **Aromatic Amino Acids with π-Interactions**: Indole rings aid in coordination or stabilization (Rule 10).

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:

  - **Distant Functional Groups**: Reduced chelation effectiveness due to distance (Rule 5).
  - **Electron-Donating Para Substituents**: Decrease carboxylate acidity and coordination (Rule 6).
  - **Bulky or Steric Hindrance**: Impede coordination to metal centers (Rule 7).
  - **Fluorinated Chains**: Reduce basicity of carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination (Rule 8).
  - **Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding**: Ortho-substituted hydroxyl or formyl groups reduce coordination sites (Rule 9).

These rules provide a balanced mix of simple, broadly applicable guidelines and more complex, specific considerations:

- **Balance Between Simple and Complex Rules**: Rules like 1, 2, and 6 are relatively straightforward and cover a broad range, while rules like 10 target specific structural features with significant impact on yield.
- **Physico-Chemical Considerations**: Each rule is grounded in chemical principles, such as ligand coordination ability, electronic effects, steric hindrance, and the nature of metal-ligand interactions.
- **Predictive Clarity**: The rules clearly state whether modifiers with certain structural features will result in high or low yield, aiding in the selection or design of effective modifiers.
- **Coverage**: The rules collectively cover the majority of the dataset, ensuring applicability to various molecular structures.

---

By adhering to these rules, researchers can better predict the efficacy of molecular modifiers in the reaction and make informed decisions in catalyst design and optimization. The rules emphasize the importance of functional group placement, electronic effects, and steric factors in influencing the yield of the reaction. Understanding these relationships facilitates rational design of new modifiers to optimize catalyst performance.

The rule considers combinations of functional groups and their spatial arrangement. Supported by data points (entries 6, 9 for high yield; entry 29 for low yield), the rule has sufficient coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is good.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in stating that **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (more than six carbons) and functional groups more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group result in a low yield**. It provides property insight into how increased distance reduces effective chelation and may introduce flexibility that hinders coordination. The rule considers both chain length and functional group position, adding complexity. It is supported by data points (entries 29, 31, 34 for low yield; entry 5 as a non-example with high yield), ensuring adequate coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups (e.g., -CH₃, -OCH₃, -OH) result in a low yield**.

It provides property insight into how the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination. The rule focuses on a specific substructure, adding necessary complexity. Supported by data points (entries 14, 28 for low yield), the coverage is adequate. The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and states that **modifiers capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding with the carboxylate group (e.g., ortho-hydroxyl or formyl groups) result in a low yield**. It provides property insight into how intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of coordinating groups for metal binding. The rule considers specific functional group arrangements, adding complexity. Supported by data points (entries 19, 27 for low yield; entry 4 as a non-example with high yield), the coverage is sufficient. The balance between rule complexity and data coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that **amino acids with aromatic side chains capable of π-interactions (e.g., indole rings) result in a high yield**. While it provides property insight into the role of π-stacking interactions aiding in coordination or stabilization, the rule's clarity is slightly impacted due to potential conflict with Rule 7 regarding steric hindrance. Coverage is limited, with only one example (entry 15) for high yield and one non-example (entry 13) for low yield. This affects the rule's coverage and balance, suggesting that more data points or refinement may be needed to strengthen this rule.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), or thiol (-SH) groups located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. The close proximity of these polar groups enhances chelation with the metal center, improving catalyst performance.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Amino group too distant)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group too distant)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups** such as **nitro (-NO₂), bromo (-Br), or amino (-NH₂)** result in a **high yield**. These groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate and enhance coordination with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Para methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde may interfere with coordination)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring**, especially **pyridine or pyrazole rings**, result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Bulky structure causes steric hindrance)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups** result in a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups enhance chelation and coordination with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group too distant)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (more than six carbons) where functional groups are more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The distance reduces effective chelation and may introduce flexibility that hinders coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (High yield despite long chain due to lack of interfering groups)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups** such as **methyl (-CH₃), methoxy (-OCH₃), or hydroxyl (-OH)** result in a **low yield**. These groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, reducing coordination efficiency.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Electron-withdrawing group enhances yield)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **bulky or sterically hindering groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **phenyl rings or large substituents**, result in a **low yield** due to decreased ability to coordinate with metal centers.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **fluorinated alkyl chains near the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
     - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **functional groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** with the carboxylate group, such as **ortho-hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups**, result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of coordinating groups for metal binding.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Para-hydroxyl group does not facilitate intramolecular hydrogen bonding)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains capable of π-interactions** (e.g., **indole rings**) result in a **high yield**. The aromatic side chains can participate in additional coordination or stabilization through π-stacking interactions with the metal center.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

**End of Rules**

---

**Summary and Justification:**

These rules are designed to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. They combine multiple substructures and functional groups, considering underlying physico-chemical properties to explain their effects on yield.

- **High Yield Modifiers**:

  - **Proximal Polar Groups**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups within three carbons enhance chelation (Rule 1).
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Para Substituents**: Increase carboxylate acidity and coordination ability in aromatic acids (Rule 2).
  - **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles**: Provide additional coordination sites (Rule 3).
  - **Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups**: Enhance chelation through multiple coordinating sites (Rule 4).
  - **Aromatic Amino Acids with π-Interactions**: Indole rings aid in coordination or stabilization (Rule 10).

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:

  - **Distant Functional Groups**: Reduced chelation effectiveness due to distance (Rule 5).
  - **Electron-Donating Para Substituents**: Decrease carboxylate acidity and coordination (Rule 6).
  - **Bulky or Steric Hindrance**: Impede coordination to metal centers (Rule 7).
  - **Fluorinated Chains**: Reduce basicity of carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination (Rule 8).
  - **Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding**: Ortho-substituted hydroxyl or formyl groups reduce coordination sites (Rule 9).

These rules provide a balanced mix of simple, broadly applicable guidelines and more complex, specific considerations:

- **Balance Between Simple and Complex Rules**: Rules like 1, 2, and 6 are relatively straightforward and cover a broad range, while rules like 10 target specific structural features with significant impact on yield.
- **Physico-Chemical Considerations**: Each rule is grounded in chemical principles, such as ligand coordination ability, electronic effects, steric hindrance, and the nature of metal-ligand interactions.
- **Predictive Clarity**: The rules clearly state whether modifiers with certain structural features will result in high or low yield, aiding in the selection or design of effective modifiers.
- **Coverage**: The rules collectively cover the majority of the dataset, ensuring applicability to various molecular structures.

---

By adhering to these rules, researchers can better predict the efficacy of molecular modifiers in the reaction and make informed decisions in catalyst design and optimization. The rules emphasize the importance of functional group placement, electronic effects, and steric factors in influencing the yield of the reaction. Understanding these relationships facilitates rational design of new modifiers to optimize catalyst performance.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: *Adjust Rule 1 to Correctly Identify Relevant Molecules*  
  The current code for **Rule 1** does not correctly identify molecules like aspartic acid and glutamic acid, which should match this rule. The issue lies in the SMARTS pattern for the carboxylic acid (`[C;!R;!a][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]`), which may not match carboxylic acids attached to chiral centers or in the context of amino acids. Additionally, the functional group patterns only consider primary amines (`[NX3H2]`) but not other relevant amino groups.  

  **Improvement**:  
  - Use a more general SMARTS pattern for carboxylic acids that includes cases where the carboxyl carbon is attached to a nitrogen or chiral center. For example, use `[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]` to match any carboxylic acid group regardless of its attachment.
  - Expand the amino group pattern to include protonated amines and secondary amines, which are common in amino acids: `[NX3;H1,H2]`.
  - Ensure that the code checks for the distance between the carboxyl carbon and the functional group, accounting for different molecular structures.

- **Suggestion 2**: *Correct Para-Substitution Detection in Rule 2*  
  For **Rule 2**, the code's SMARTS patterns for detecting para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups may not accurately identify the substituents at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. The patterns like `c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])[cH]cc1` do not ensure that the substituent is para to the carboxyl group.  

  **Improvement**:  
  - Modify the aromatic carboxylic acid pattern to include the carboxyl group explicitly and map atom indices to identify positions.
  - Use atom mapping to ensure that the substituent is in the para position relative to the carboxyl carbon. An example pattern:
    ```
    [cH]-[c]1[cH][c][c][c][c]1C(=O)O
    ```
    Then, check if there is an electron-withdrawing group attached to the carbon in the para position.
  - Define electron-withdrawing groups more broadly, including other possible substituents.

- **Suggestion 3**: *Generalize Rule 10 to Capture Aromatic Amino Acids*  
  The code for **Rule 10** uses a SMARTS pattern that matches only tryptophan precisely, missing other amino acids with aromatic side chains capable of π-interactions, like histidine and tyrosine (if applicable).  

  **Improvement**:  
  - Create a general SMARTS pattern for amino acids with aromatic side chains. For example:
    ```
    [NX3][C@@H](CC1=CC=CC=C1)[C](=O)[OX1H1]
    ```
    to match phenylalanine (though this example is specified as low yield in Rule 7). Modify the pattern to identify indole, imidazole, or other aromatic rings connected via a side chain.
  - Use substructure searches for aromatic rings connected to the alpha carbon of an amino acid:
    ```
    [NX3][$([C;!H0]),$([C;!H0][C])][C](=O)[OX1H1]
    ```
    combined with a search for aromatic rings in the side chain at a specific distance from the amine group.

- **Suggestion 4**: *Improve Pattern Specificity and Generality Across Rules*  
  The SMARTS patterns in several rules are either too specific or too general, leading to incorrect matches or misses.

  **Improvement**:  
  - Review and revise SMARTS patterns to ensure they accurately reflect the natural language rules. Patterns should be neither so specific that they miss valid matches nor so general that they produce false positives.
  - For example, in **Rule 3**, expand the patterns to include other nitrogen-containing heterocycles beyond pyridine and pyrazole, if they fit the rule's intention.

- **Suggestion 5**: *Implement Comprehensive Functional Group Identification*  
  The detection of functional groups and their positions relative to key moieties is crucial.

  **Improvement**:  
  - Utilize RDKit functionalities such as `GetDistanceMatrix` to compute the distances between functional groups and the carboxyl group more reliably.
  - For **Rule 1**, after identifying carboxylic acid groups, find all amino, hydroxyl, and thiol groups and calculate the shortest path lengths between them and the carboxyl carbon.
  - Ensure that the code accounts for various structural nuances, such as rings, branches, and stereo centers.

- **Suggestion 6**: *Verify and Update Other Rules Similarly*  
  Other rules may also have issues similar to those identified.

  **Improvement**:  
  - For **Rule 5**, ensure that the code accurately counts carbon atoms in chains and identifies the positions of functional groups relative to the carboxyl group.
  - For **Rule 6**, use patterns that accurately detect electron-donating groups at the para position, ensuring that they are correctly positioned relative to the carboxyl group.

**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

---

**Comparison with Reference Metrics:**

1. **Confidence:**
   - **Reference Metrics:** Mean train confidence of approximately **58.74%** (from 63.52% and 53.96%).
   - **Current Metrics:** Mean train confidence of approximately **63.37%** across all current rules.
   - **Observation:** There is an improvement in mean confidence from the reference metrics to the current metrics, indicating that the current rules are, on average, making more accurate predictions.

2. **Lift:**
   - **Reference Metrics:** Mean train lift of approximately **1.1304** (from 1.2048 and 1.0559).
   - **Current Metrics:** Mean train lift of approximately **1.2710** across all current rules.
   - **Observation:** The mean lift has increased, suggesting that the current rules are better at improving the prediction of high yields over the baseline probability.

3. **Support:**
   - **Reference Metrics:** Mean train support of approximately **17.56%**.
   - **Current Metrics:** Mean train support of approximately **5.63%**.
   - **Observation:** There is a significant decrease in support, indicating that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.

4. **Leverage:**
   - **Reference Metrics:** Mean train leverage of approximately **0.0124**.
   - **Current Metrics:** Mean train leverage of approximately **0.00706**.
   - **Observation:** Slight decrease in leverage, suggesting that the current rules provide less additional information over chance compared to previous rules.

---

**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Improvement in Confidence and Lift:**
   - The increase in mean confidence and lift indicates that the current rules are more effective at correctly predicting high yields when they apply.
   - High confidence values (e.g., Rule 1 with 74.44% confidence) suggest that, when the rule conditions are met, there is a strong likelihood of achieving a high yield.
   - Increased lift values (e.g., Rule 1 with a lift of 1.4997) show that the rules are providing valuable insights beyond random chance.

2. **Decrease in Support:**
   - The reduction in support means that the rules are applicable to fewer cases within the dataset.
   - While high confidence and lift are desirable, low support may limit the practical utility of the rules, as they do not cover a significant portion of potential modifiers.
   - This trade-off suggests that the rules may be too specific or narrowly defined, capturing fewer instances.

3. **Leverage Insights:**
   - Leverage measures the difference between observed and expected support.
   - The slight decrease in leverage indicates that the additional benefit gained from the rules over random chance has marginally declined.
   - Positive leverage values across most rules suggest that the associations are stronger than would be expected by chance, albeit with varying degrees.

4. **Variability Among Rules:**
   - **Rule 4** presents a confidence of **46.19%** and a lift of **0.9120**, which is below 1.
     - **Interpretation:** A lift below 1 indicates that the rule is less effective than random chance in predicting high yields.
     - **Implication:** This rule may not be reliable and could be reconsidered or refined.
   - Other rules maintain confidence levels above 60% and lift values significantly above 1, reinforcing their predictive strength.

---

**Assessment of Iterative Improvements:**

1. **Diminishing Returns in Metrics:**
   - Initial rules (Rules 1-3) exhibit higher confidence and lift values compared to later rules.
   - Subsequent rules show a gradual decline in these metrics, suggesting that each new rule contributes less to the overall predictive performance.
   - The pattern indicates that as more rules are added, the incremental benefit decreases, pointing towards a potential local minimum.

2. **Local Minimum Reached:**
   - The decreasing trend in confidence and lift across iterations suggests that the optimization process may have plateaued.
   - Further iterations are yielding minimal improvements and, in some cases, producing rules with less predictive power.
   - This plateau indicates that the current set of rules may not significantly improve with additional iterations without strategic changes.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Refine or Remove Low-Performing Rules:**
   - **Rule 4** should be re-evaluated due to its low confidence and lift below 1.
     - Consider revising the conditions of the rule to better capture high-yield cases.
     - If refinement is not feasible, it may be prudent to remove the rule to avoid misleading predictions.
   - Similarly, examine other rules with lower confidence and lift to assess their validity.

2. **Increase Support without Compromising Confidence:**
   - Explore ways to generalize rules to cover a larger portion of the dataset.
     - Identify common features among high-yield modifiers that can be incorporated into existing rules.
     - Ensure that broadening the rules does not significantly decrease confidence and lift.

3. **Combine Similar Rules:**
   - Merge rules with overlapping structural features or mechanisms.
     - For example, combine **Rule 2** and **Rule 6** by refining the focus on electronic effects in aromatic carboxylic acids.
   - A combined rule may increase support while maintaining high confidence and lift.

4. **Leverage Physico-Chemical Principles:**
   - Reassess the chemical rationale behind each rule to strengthen their foundations.
     - Validate that the structural features in the rules are indeed contributing to high yields through known chemical interactions.
   - Incorporate additional chemical insights or experimental data to enhance rule effectiveness.

5. **Optimize Rule Complexity:**
   - Strike a balance between simplicity and specificity.
     - Overly complex rules may have high confidence but low support.
     - Simplifying rules without losing critical predictive features can make them more broadly applicable.

6. **Re-evaluate Dataset Partitioning:**
   - Consider whether the dataset contains biases or imbalances affecting the metrics.
     - Ensure that the training data is representative of the full scope of potential modifiers.
   - If necessary, augment the dataset with additional examples to improve rule training.

7. **Alternative Metrics for Evaluation:**
   - Incorporate other metrics such as **Precision**, **Recall**, or **F1 Score** to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the rules.
   - These metrics can highlight different aspects of rule performance and guide further refinement.

---

**Conclusion:**

- The current rules show an improvement in confidence and lift over the reference metrics, indicating better predictive accuracy when they apply.
- However, the decrease in support suggests that the rules are becoming too specialized, limiting their practical utility.
- The trends in the metrics point towards reaching a local minimum, where additional iterations yield diminishing returns.
- By refining low-performing rules, increasing support, and leveraging chemical insights, the rules can be improved to provide better coverage and maintain high predictive power.
- A strategic approach focusing on both the quantitative metrics and the underlying chemistry will enhance the effectiveness of the rules in guiding experimental efforts.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rules and Model Performance**

**1. Evaluation of Current Performance Metrics**

Based on the training results provided, the current iteration achieves a 5-fold validation accuracy of **0.5429** using the classification model. This performance is compared against previous iterations:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies**: Consistently around **0.76**.
- **Previous Test Accuracies**: **0.75**, **0.75**, **0.625**, **0.625**.

**Observations:**

- **Decrease in Validation Accuracy**: The current validation accuracy of **0.5429** is significantly lower than the previous iterations’ validation accuracies of **0.76**.
- **Variability in Performance**: Previous iterations show stable validation accuracies, whereas the current results indicate fluctuations across iterations (ranging from **0.4857** to **0.7143**).

**Implications:**

- The decline in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data as effectively as before.
- The variability hints at inconsistencies in model performance, possibly due to overfitting, underfitting, or issues with the current rules.

---

**2. Assessment of the Effectiveness of Current Rules**

**Effectiveness Evaluation:**

- **Rule Coverage**: The current rules aim to capture key structural features influencing the catalytic performance.
- **Rule Complexity**: The balance between simple and complex rules needs re-evaluation as the performance has decreased.
- **Model Predictions vs. Experimental Values**: Instances where the model predictions do not align with experimental values indicate potential shortcomings in the rules.

**Conclusion:**

- **Current Rules May Be Ineffective**: Given the decreased accuracy and discrepancies in predictions, the current rules may not be effectively capturing the determinants of catalyst performance.
- **Need for Refinement**: There is room to improve the rules to enhance model performance.

---

**3. Assessment of Overfitting and Underfitting**

**Overfitting Indicators:**

- **High Training Accuracy vs. Low Validation Accuracy**: Since only validation accuracy is reported, it's difficult to directly assess overfitting.
- However, the consistent high validation accuracies in earlier iterations suggest the model might have been overfitting to specific features captured by the initial rules.

**Underfitting Indicators:**

- **Low Validation Accuracy**: The current lower validation accuracy implies the model may be underfitting, failing to capture essential patterns in the data.

**Conclusion:**

- **Potential Shift from Overfitting to Underfitting**: Adjustments made to the rules over iterations may have led to underfitting.
- **Model Complexity vs. Data Representativeness**: The current rules may be too simplistic or not adequately representative of the data's complexity.

---

**4. Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

**Approach:**

- **Identify Molecules with Misaligned Predictions**: Focus on molecules where predicted loading does not match the experimental value.
- **Examine SHAP Values**: For these molecules, analyze which rules contribute most positively or negatively to the incorrect prediction.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecules**:
     - *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
     - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O*
     - *C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN*
   - **SHAP Analysis**:
     - **Rule 2** and **Rule 6** contribute positively to high loading predictions.
     - **Rule 2 SHAP values**: Negative small values, indicating minimal influence.
     - **Rule 6 SHAP values**: Significant positive values, suggesting it heavily influences the overprediction.

2. **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - **Molecules**:
     - *C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O*
     - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N*
   - **SHAP Analysis**:
     - **Rule 2** has negative SHAP values.
     - **Rule 6** has negative SHAP values.
     - Indicates that these rules are contributing to the underprediction.

**Conclusion:**

- **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values in Overestimations**: **Rule 6** may be problematic, leading to overpredictions when the experimental value is low.
- **Rules with High Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations**: **Rule 2** may be overly penalizing certain structures, resulting in underpredictions when the experimental value is high.

---

**5. Interpretation of Accuracy Declines**

**Factors Contributing to Decline:**

- **Inadequate Rule Refinement**: The iterations may not have effectively improved the rules to capture more accurate patterns.
- **Overemphasis on Certain Features**: Rules contributing heavily to incorrect predictions may dominate the model, reducing overall accuracy.
- **Data Representation**: The diversity and representativeness of the dataset may influence model performance and should be considered.

**Model Stagnation:**

- **Local Minimum**: The accuracy fluctuations suggest the model may have reached a local minimum, with current rules unable to surpass previous performance.
- **Need for Alternative Strategies**: New approaches or significant adjustments to the rules are required to improve performance.

---

**6. Insights from SHAP Analysis for Rule Improvement**

**SHAP Analysis Highlights:**

- **Rule 2** (Modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids and para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups):

  - Negative SHAP values in underpredictions.
  - May be too restrictive or improperly weighted.

- **Rule 6** (Modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids and para-substituted electron-donating groups):

  - Positive SHAP values in overpredictions.
  - May be overemphasizing the negative impact of electron-donating groups.

**Suggestions for Rule Adjustments Based on SHAP Insights:**

- **Refine Rule 2**:

  - Consider broadening the scope to include additional electron-withdrawing groups.
  - Re-evaluate how the presence of certain substituents affects the acidity and coordination ability.

- **Modify Rule 6**:

  - Adjust the rule to account for cases where electron-donating groups do not significantly reduce yield.
  - Incorporate additional factors such as steric hindrance or overall molecule polarity.

- **Consider Rule Interactions**:

  - Examine how Rules 2 and 6 interact and possibly conflict.
  - Develop combined rules or adjust thresholds to better differentiate between high and low yield modifiers.

---

**7. Recommendations for Rule Improvement**

**General Strategies:**

- **Reassess Rule Definitions**:

  - Ensure that rules are not overly general or specific.
  - Use chemical intuition and empirical data to fine-tune the criteria within each rule.

- **Address Overfitting and Underfitting**:

  - **Overfitting**: Simplify or remove rules that may be too tailored to specific data points.
  - **Underfitting**: Enhance rules by adding relevant features or considerations that capture more complexity.

**Specific Recommendations:**

1. **Refine Rule 2**:

   - **Incorporate Substituent Effects**: Include meta-substituted electron-withdrawing groups if data supports their effectiveness.
   - **Adjust Weighting**: Modify the influence of Rule 2 in the model to prevent underprediction for certain molecules.

2. **Adjust Rule 6**:

   - **Differentiate Between Electron-Donating Groups**: Not all electron-donating groups have the same effect. For example, methoxy groups may have a different impact than methyl groups.
   - **Include Contextual Factors**: Consider the position of substituents and their combined electronic effects.

3. **Introduce New Rules or Modify Existing Ones**:

   - **Include Steric Factors More Precisely**: Develop rules that quantify steric hindrance more effectively.
   - **Consider Hydrogen Bonding Potential**: Create rules that account for intramolecular hydrogen bonding beyond ortho-substituted groups.

4. **Re-evaluate Rule Interaction and Combination**:

   - **Rule Hierarchies**: Establish priority or conditional application of rules to handle conflicting predictions.
   - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge rules that address related features to simplify the model and reduce redundancy.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data and Feedback**:

   - **Extend the Dataset**: If possible, include more diverse examples to enhance the model’s learning.
   - **Iteratively Test Adjustments**: With each rule modification, evaluate the impact on validation accuracy and SHAP values.

**Implementing Recommendations:**

- **Test Adjusted Rules**: Apply the revised rules to the dataset and observe changes in accuracy and SHAP values.
- **Monitor for Improvement**: Aim for increased validation accuracy and better alignment between predicted and experimental values.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continue to refine the rules based on performance metrics and SHAP analysis until satisfactory results are achieved.

---

**8. Conclusion**

The current analysis indicates that the rules governing the feature matrix need refinement to improve model performance. By focusing on Rules 2 and 6, which play significant roles in incorrect predictions, and adjusting them based on SHAP analysis insights, we can enhance the model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, addressing overfitting and underfitting issues through careful rule adjustment and model evaluation will contribute to better generalization and effectiveness of the catalyst prediction model.

**Summary and Directions to Optimize Current Rules:**

1. **Adjust Rule 1 for Accurate Identification of Relevant Molecules:**
   - **Issue:** Rule 1 currently fails to correctly identify molecules like aspartic acid and glutamic acid, which should match this rule due to their structural features.
   - **Suggestion:** Modify the SMARTS patterns to more accurately capture aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups. Specifically:
     - Use a more general pattern for carboxylic acids, such as `[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]`, to include carboxyl groups attached to various carbons, including chiral centers.
     - Expand the amino group pattern to include different amine types, such as `[NX3;H1,H2]`, to capture primary, secondary, and protonated amines.
     - Implement distance calculations (e.g., using RDKit's `GetDistanceMatrix`) to ensure functional groups are within three carbons of the carboxyl group, regardless of molecule complexity.

2. **Correct Para-Substitution Detection in Rule 2:**
   - **Issue:** The current patterns may not accurately detect para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups relative to the carboxyl group in aromatic compounds.
   - **Suggestion:** Revise the SMARTS patterns to explicitly include the carboxyl group and map atom indices to identify substituent positions. For example:
     - Define the carboxylic acid in the aromatic ring explicitly and use atom mapping to ensure the substituent is in the para position relative to the carboxyl carbon.
     - Broaden the definition of electron-withdrawing groups to include additional relevant substituents.

3. **Generalize Rule 10 to Include Aromatic Amino Acids with π-Interactions:**
   - **Issue:** Rule 10 focuses narrowly on tryptophan, missing other aromatic amino acids like histidine and tyrosine, which can also engage in π-interactions.
   - **Suggestion:** Create a more general SMARTS pattern to capture amino acids with aromatic side chains capable of π-interactions. For example:
     - Use patterns that identify amino acids bound to aromatic rings, adjusting for various ring types and connectivities.
     - Include side chains with imidazole (histidine) and phenolic (tyrosine) groups.

4. **Improve Pattern Specificity and Generality Across Rules:**
   - **Issue:** Some SMARTS patterns are either too specific, missing valid matches, or too general, capturing unintended structures.
   - **Suggestion:** Review and refine all SMARTS patterns to align closely with the chemical intent of each rule. Ensure that patterns:
     - Accurately represent the structural features described.
     - Avoid unintended matches by specifying necessary constraints.
     - Are tested against a diverse set of molecules to validate their effectiveness.

5. **Implement Comprehensive Functional Group Identification:**
   - **Issue:** The current method may not reliably detect functional groups and their positions due to complex molecular structures.
   - **Suggestion:** Utilize computational tools to improve accuracy:
     - Use RDKit's molecular graph analysis to calculate exact distances between atoms, ensuring functional groups are correctly identified within the specified proximity to the carboxyl group.
     - Account for ring structures, stereochemistry, and branching in the distance calculations.

6. **Assess and Refine Other Rules as Needed:**
   - **Issue:** Other rules may have similar issues affecting their performance.
   - **Suggestion:** Systematically evaluate each rule:
     - Analyze rules with low confidence and lift metrics to identify underlying problems.
     - Adjust SMARTS patterns and criteria to improve rule performance.
     - Consider merging similar rules to increase support while maintaining high confidence and lift.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

Given the identified issues and the potential improvements outlined above, there is a significant opportunity to optimize the current rules further. Refining the SMARTS patterns and criteria will enhance the model's ability to accurately predict the catalytic performance without overfitting. Careful adjustments, grounded in chemical reasoning and validated through performance metrics, can lead to a more effective and generalizable set of rules.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), or thiol (-SH) groups located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. The close proximity of these polar groups enhances chelation with the metal center, improving catalyst performance.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Amino group too distant)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group too distant)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups** such as **nitro (-NO₂), bromo (-Br), or amino (-NH₂)** result in a **high yield**. These groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate and enhance coordination with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Para methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde may interfere with coordination)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring**, especially **pyridine or pyrazole rings**, result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Bulky structure causes steric hindrance)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups** result in a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups enhance chelation and coordination with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group too distant)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (more than six carbons) where functional groups are more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The distance reduces effective chelation and may introduce flexibility that hinders coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (High yield despite long chain due to lack of interfering groups)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups** such as **methyl (-CH₃), methoxy (-OCH₃), or hydroxyl (-OH)** result in a **low yield**. These groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, reducing coordination efficiency.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Electron-withdrawing group enhances yield)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **bulky or sterically hindering groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **phenyl rings or large substituents**, result in a **low yield** due to decreased ability to coordinate with metal centers.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **fluorinated alkyl chains near the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
     - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **functional groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** with the carboxylate group, such as **ortho-hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups**, result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of coordinating groups for metal binding.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Para-hydroxyl group does not facilitate intramolecular hydrogen bonding)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains capable of π-interactions** (e.g., **indole rings**) result in a **high yield**. The aromatic side chains can participate in additional coordination or stabilization through π-stacking interactions with the metal center.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:

**Summary and Justification:**

These rules are designed to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. They combine multiple substructures and functional groups, considering underlying physico-chemical properties to explain their effects on yield.

- **High Yield Modifiers**:

  - **Proximal Polar Groups**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups within three carbons enhance chelation (Rule 1).
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Para Substituents**: Increase carboxylate acidity and coordination ability in aromatic acids (Rule 2).
  - **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles**: Provide additional coordination sites (Rule 3).
  - **Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups**: Enhance chelation through multiple coordinating sites (Rule 4).
  - **Aromatic Amino Acids with π-Interactions**: Indole rings aid in coordination or stabilization (Rule 10).

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:

  - **Distant Functional Groups**: Reduced chelation effectiveness due to distance (Rule 5).
  - **Electron-Donating Para Substituents**: Decrease carboxylate acidity and coordination (Rule 6).
  - **Bulky or Steric Hindrance**: Impede coordination to metal centers (Rule 7).
  - **Fluorinated Chains**: Reduce basicity of carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination (Rule 8).
  - **Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding**: Ortho-substituted hydroxyl or formyl groups reduce coordination sites (Rule 9).

These rules provide a balanced mix of simple, broadly applicable guidelines and more complex, specific considerations:

- **Balance Between Simple and Complex Rules**: Rules like 1, 2, and 6 are relatively straightforward and cover a broad range, while rules like 10 target specific structural features with significant impact on yield.
- **Physico-Chemical Considerations**: Each rule is grounded in chemical principles, such as ligand coordination ability, electronic effects, steric hindrance, and the nature of metal-ligand interactions.
- **Predictive Clarity**: The rules clearly state whether modifiers with certain structural features will result in high or low yield, aiding in the selection or design of effective modifiers.
- **Coverage**: The rules collectively cover the majority of the dataset, ensuring applicability to various molecular structures.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Modify Rule 1 to Accurately Capture Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Proximal Functional Groups**

  - **Issue**: Rule 1 currently fails to identify molecules like aspartic acid and glutamic acid due to limitations in the SMARTS patterns, missing aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Update Carboxylic Acid Pattern**: Use a more general SMARTS pattern for carboxyl groups, such as `[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]`, to include various carboxylic acid structures, including those attached to chiral centers.
    - **Expand Functional Group Definitions**: Broaden the amino group pattern to `[NX3;H1,H2]` to capture primary and secondary amines, and ensure hydroxyl (`[OX2H]`) and thiol (`[SX2H]`) groups are properly identified.
    - **Implement Distance Calculations**: Utilize RDKit's `GetShortestPath` or `GetDistanceMatrix` functions to calculate the number of bonds between the carboxyl carbon and the functional group atom. Ensure that this distance is three carbons or fewer to meet the proximity criterion.

- **Advice 2**: **Revise Rule 2 to Correctly Identify Para-Substituted Electron-Withdrawing Groups**

  - **Issue**: The existing SMARTS patterns may not accurately detect para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups relative to the carboxyl group in aromatic compounds.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Explicit Atom Mapping**: Define the aromatic carboxylic acid core with atom indices to specify the carboxyl group and the para position. For example, use `[$(c1cc([C](=O)[O])ccc1[EWG])]` where `[EWG]` represents electron-withdrawing groups.
    - **Broaden Electron-Withdrawing Group Definitions**: Include additional electron-withdrawing groups in the pattern, such as cyano (`C#N`), trifluoromethyl (`CF3`), and others known to enhance acidity.
    - **Ensure Para Positioning**: Confirm that the substituent is directly opposite the carboxyl group on the benzene ring by verifying the atom indices or using SMARTS patterns that enforce para substitution.

- **Advice 3**: **Generalize Rule 10 to Include Aromatic Amino Acids Capable of π-Interactions**

  - **Issue**: Rule 10 is too narrowly focused on tryptophan, missing other aromatic amino acids like histidine and tyrosine that can engage in π-interactions.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Expand Aromatic Side Chain Patterns**: Incorporate SMARTS patterns for imidazole rings (`c1cnc[nH]1` for histidine) and phenolic rings (`c1ccc(cc1)O` for tyrosine).
    - **Create a General Pattern for Aromatic Amino Acids**: Develop a pattern that captures amino acids with any aromatic side chain, such as `[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H1])[CX4][Ar]`, where `[Ar]` represents an aromatic ring.
    - **Include π-Stacking Capability**: Ensure the pattern captures structures capable of π-interactions by specifying aromatic rings in proximity to the amino acid moiety.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine SMARTS Patterns Across All Rules for Specificity and Generality**

  - **Issue**: Some SMARTS patterns are either too specific, missing valid molecules, or too general, capturing unintended structures.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Align Patterns with Chemical Intent**: Review each rule's SMARTS patterns to ensure they accurately represent the described structural features.
    - **Avoid Unintended Matches**: Add constraints to prevent false positives, such as specifying ring sizes, degree of saturation, or excluding certain functional groups.
    - **Validate Patterns**: Test the refined patterns against the dataset and additional molecules to confirm they correctly identify high and low yield modifiers.

- **Advice 5**: **Implement Accurate Functional Group Position Detection**

  - **Issue**: Current methods may not reliably detect the positions of functional groups relative to the carboxyl group in complex molecules.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Use Molecular Graph Analysis**: Employ RDKit's `GetDistanceMatrix` to calculate the shortest path (number of bonds) between the carboxyl carbon and functional group atoms.
    - **Account for Molecular Complexity**: Ensure distance calculations consider rings, branching, and stereochemistry to accurately reflect the true spatial arrangement.
    - **Set Clear Distance Criteria**: Define the maximum allowed number of bonds (e.g., three carbons) between the carboxyl group and functional groups to meet the rule conditions.

- **Advice 6**: **Systematically Reassess and Enhance Other Rules**

  - **Issue**: Other rules may have performance issues due to similar pattern inaccuracies or oversights.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Evaluate Rule Performance Metrics**: Analyze confidence and lift metrics for each rule to identify those needing improvement.
    - **Adjust Patterns Accordingly**: Refine the SMARTS patterns of underperforming rules, ensuring they are neither too broad nor too narrow.
    - **Consider Rule Consolidation**: If appropriate, merge similar rules to increase their statistical support while maintaining specificity.
    - **Ground Rules in Chemical Principles**: Ensure all rules are based on well-understood chemical properties and reaction mechanisms to enhance their predictive power.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and well-defined, enabling straightforward classification of modifiers based on the proximity of amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), or thiol (-SH) groups to the carboxyl group within aliphatic carboxylic acids. The physicochemical insight is solid, as close polar groups enhance chelation with the metal center, improving catalyst performance. The rule effectively combines multiple substructures and is supported by several examples in the dataset, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 provides a precise guideline for identifying high-yield modifiers among aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (-NO₂), bromo (-Br), or amino (-NH₂). The physicochemical rationale is appropriate, explaining how electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and coordination ability. The rule combines structural features effectively, and multiple data points support its validity, ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups, such as methyl (-CH₃), result in a low yield. The physicochemical insight is sound, highlighting how electron-donating groups decrease acidity and reduce coordination efficiency. While the rule is straightforward, its coverage is limited to a few data points. Additional examples would strengthen its applicability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and effectively identifies high-yield modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring. The nitrogen atoms serve as additional coordination sites with the metal center, providing strong physicochemical justification. The rule combines specific structural features and is well-supported by multiple examples in the dataset, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly indicates that aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups lead to high yields. The physicochemical rationale is appropriate, as additional hydroxyl groups enhance chelation and coordination with the metal center. The rule combines multiple substructures, though its coverage is limited to two examples. Incorporating more data points would enhance its robustness.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 provides a clear guideline that aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups located more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group result in low yields. The physicochemical insight is solid, explaining how increased distance reduces effective chelation. The rule effectively combines structural features with positional information and is well-supported by multiple examples, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly identifies that modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups near the carboxyl group result in low yields. The physicochemical rationale is strong, as the electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine weaken metal coordination. The rule combines specific substituents with positional context and, although based on limited data points, is valid within its scope.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 effectively highlights that sterically bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxyl group, such as aromatic rings or large side chains, lead to low yields due to steric hindrance affecting metal coordination. The physicochemical insight is appropriate, and the rule combines structural considerations with steric effects. It is supported by multiple examples in the dataset, demonstrating acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 aims to identify low-yield modifiers with ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups relative to the carboxyl group on aromatic rings. The physicochemical rationale is valid, as intramolecular hydrogen bonding can reduce available coordination sites. However, the examples provided may cause confusion due to complex structures. Clarifying or revising the examples would enhance the rule's clarity and effectiveness.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 suggests that amino acids with aromatic side chains capable of π-interactions, such as indole rings, result in high yields. While the physicochemical insight attempts to explain the enhanced performance, the rule lacks clarity because both indole and phenyl rings are capable of π-interactions. The limited coverage and potential inconsistency with phenylalanine as a non-example indicate that the rule may require further investigation and refinement.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with formyl (-CHO) substituents, regardless of position, result in low yields. The physicochemical rationale is acceptable, noting that formyl groups may interfere with metal coordination. The rule is straightforward but could benefit from considering additional modifiers or functional group combinations to increase complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 identifies long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups as high-yield modifiers. The rule is clear and provides plausible physicochemical insight, suggesting that the absence of interfering groups facilitates better interaction with the catalyst. However, the coverage is limited to a single example. Including more data points would strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 effectively addresses modifiers with polyether chains or flexible linkers bearing amino (-NH₂) groups distant from the carboxyl group, resulting in low yields due to reduced effective chelation. The physicochemical insight is appropriate, and the rule combines multiple structural features. It is supported by two examples, providing acceptable coverage within its specific context.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), or thiol (-SH) groups located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. The close proximity of these polar groups enhances chelation with the metal center, improving catalyst performance.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups**, such as **nitro (-NO₂), bromo (-Br), or amino (-NH₂)**, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)**, result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing coordination efficiency.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring**, such as **pyridine, pyrazole, or pyridone rings**, result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms can act as additional coordination sites with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups** result in a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups enhance chelation and coordination with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups located more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The increased distance reduces effective chelation.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups near the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
     - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **sterically bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **aromatic rings or large side chains**, result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance affecting metal coordination.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups** relative to the carboxyl group on aromatic rings result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of coordinating sites.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains capable of π-interactions**, such as **indole rings**, result in a **high yield**. The aromatic side chains may participate in π interactions with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with formyl (-CHO) substituents**, regardless of position, result in a **low yield**. The formyl group may interfere with metal coordination or engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The absence of interfering groups may facilitate better interaction with the catalyst.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **Octanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **polyether chains or flexible linkers bearing amino (-NH₂) groups distant from the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and distance reduce effective chelation.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

**Summary and Justification:**

These rules have been designed to correlate the structural features of molecular modifiers with the observed yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. They integrate multiple functional groups and substructures, considering underlying physicochemical properties, to predict high or low yields.

- **High Yield Modifiers**:

  - **Proximal Polar Groups**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups within three carbons enhance chelation with metal centers (Rule 1).
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Para Substituents**: Aromatic acids with para electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and coordination ability (Rule 2).
  - **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles**: Heterocyclic acids with nitrogen atoms provide additional coordination sites (Rule 4).
  - **Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups**: Polyhydroxy acids offer multiple coordination points (Rule 5).
  - **Amino Acids with Indole Rings**: Aromatic side chains like indole can engage in π interactions (Rule 10).
  - **Long-Chain Aliphatic Acids**: Simple acids without interfering groups perform well (Rule 12).

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:

  - **Distant Functional Groups**: Functional groups far from the carboxyl reduce chelation effectiveness (Rule 6).
  - **Fluorinated Chains**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects weaken coordination (Rule 7).
  - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents near the carboxyl group impede coordination (Rule 8).
  - **Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding**: Ortho hydroxyl or formyl groups reduce available coordination sites (Rule 9).
  - **Formyl Substituents**: Formyl groups interfere with coordination (Rule 11).
  - **Flexible Polyether Chains**: Distant amino groups on flexible chains are less effective (Rule 13).

**Balance Between Simple and Complex Rules**:

- **Simple Rules with Broad Coverage**: Rules like 1, 2, and 6 are straightforward and cover many examples in the dataset.
- **Complex Rules with Specificity**: Rules like 10 and 13 address specific structural features impacting yield.

**Physicochemical Considerations**:

Each rule is grounded in chemical principles such as ligand coordination ability, electronic effects of substituents, steric hindrance, and the nature of metal-ligand interactions.

**Coverage and Predictive Clarity**:

The rules collectively cover the majority of the dataset, providing clear guidelines on whether a given modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structural features.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the performance of molecular modifiers in the reaction and design new modifiers to optimize catalyst activity, enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct the index handling in Rule 1's code.**

  In Rule 1, the code assumes that `carbox[0]` is always the carbon atom of the carboxylic acid group. However, the SMARTS pattern `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` matches three atoms: the carbonyl carbon, the carbonyl oxygen, and the hydroxyl oxygen. This means `carbox[0]`, `carbox[1]`, and `carbox[2]` correspond to these atoms, but their order is not guaranteed.

  **Solution**: Modify the code to identify the carbon atom explicitly:

  ```python
  for carbox in carbox_matches:
      carbox_atoms = [mol.GetAtomWithIdx(idx) for idx in carbox]
      # Identify the carbon atom in the carboxylic acid group
      carbox_atom_idx = None
      for idx in carbox:
          atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(idx)
          if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6:  # Carbon atom
              carbox_atom_idx = idx
              break
      if carbox_atom_idx is None:
          continue  # Skip if carbon atom not found
      # Proceed with the rest of the code
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: **Revise distance calculation in Rule 1 to account for paths correctly.**

  The current code counts the number of carbon atoms in the shortest path but doesn't consider branching paths where the functional group is within three bonds but not along the main chain. Additionally, hydrogen atoms are not considered, potentially miscalculating the distance.

  **Solution**: Use the topological distance (number of bonds) between the carboxylic carbon and the functional group's atom:

  ```python
  path_length = len(path) - 1  # Number of bonds between atoms
  if path_length <= rule['distance']:
      match = True
      break
  ```

- **Suggestion 3**: **Ensure para-substituents are correctly identified in Rules 2 and 3.**

  In Rules 2 and 3, the code needs to check that the substituents are in the para position relative to the carboxyl group on an aromatic ring. The current implementation may incorrectly match substituents in other positions or other rings.

  **Solution**: Use RDKit's substructure queries to specify the para relationship:

  ```python
  # Define a SMARTS pattern for an aromatic ring with carboxylic acid and substituent in para positions
  'para_substituted_aromatic_acid': '[cH]1[cH][cH][c]([SX1])[cH][c]1C(=O)O'  # Example for substituent S
  # Replace [SX1] with appropriate substituent patterns
  ```

  Alternatively, map the positions explicitly using atom indices in the match and ensure that the substituent is at the position opposite to the carboxyl group in the ring.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Define SMARTS patterns accurately for substituents in Rules 2 and 3.**

  The patterns for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) should be precise. For example, the amino group in EWG should be positively charged or have resonance structures that withdraw electron density.

  **Solution**: Update the EWG and EDG patterns to reflect their electronic effects accurately:

  ```python
  # For EWGs
  'ewg_substituents': ['[c][N+](=O)[O-]', '[c][Br]', '[c][N+H2]']  # Note: Amino groups are typically EDGs

  # For EDGs
  'edg_substituents': ['[c][CH3]', '[c][OH]', '[c][NH2]']
  ```

  **Note**: Amino groups are generally electron-donating due to the lone pair on nitrogen, so they should be included in EDGs, not EWGs.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Implement adjacency check for hydroxyl groups in Rule 5.**

  Rule 5 requires that multiple hydroxyl groups be adjacent (i.e., on consecutive carbon atoms). The current code only checks for the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups without ensuring adjacency.

  **Solution**: After finding hydroxyl group matches, check if they are connected to adjacent carbon atoms:

  ```python
  # Build a set of hydroxyl-bearing carbon atom indices
  hydroxyl_carbons = set()
  for oh_match in oh_matches:
      oh_atom_idx = oh_match[0]
      oh_atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(oh_atom_idx)
      for neighbor in oh_atom.GetNeighbors():
          if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 6:  # Carbon
              hydroxyl_carbons.add(neighbor.GetIdx())
  
  # Check for adjacency among hydroxyl-bearing carbons
  adjacency_found = False
  for idx1 in hydroxyl_carbons:
      for idx2 in hydroxyl_carbons:
          if idx1 != idx2 and mol.GetBondBetweenAtoms(idx1, idx2):
              adjacency_found = True
              break
      if adjacency_found:
          break

  if adjacency_found and ca_matches:
      match = True
  ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **Extend the code to implement all the rules comprehensively.**

  Currently, only the first five rules are implemented. To fully evaluate the modifiers, the code should implement all the rules provided.

  **Solution**: Incrementally add the remaining rules (6 to 13) to the code, ensuring each rule's logic is accurately translated from the natural language description to SMARTS patterns and code logic.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Add error handling and unit tests for robustness.**

  Implementing detailed error handling will help identify and fix issues quickly. Unit tests using the provided examples and non-examples for each rule can validate that the code works as intended.

  **Solution**: Incorporate try-except blocks where appropriate and write unit tests for each rule:

  ```python
  import unittest

  class TestRuleMatching(unittest.TestCase):
      def test_rule1(self):
          # Test examples and non-examples for Rule 1
          pass
      # Additional test methods for other rules

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      unittest.main()
  ```

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Consolidate Rules for Computational Application**
  
  Simplify the existing rules by consolidating similar patterns and focusing on key structural features that can be directly identified from SMILES strings. For example, combine Rules 1 and 5, which both involve aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal polar groups (amino, hydroxyl, thiol), into a single rule emphasizing the presence of these groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 2**: **Translate Structural Features into SMARTS Patterns**

  Convert the rules into SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns that can be used for substructure searching in cheminformatics tools. This approach allows for the automatic identification of specific functional groups and structural motifs within the SMILES strings, facilitating the generation of a numerical feature matrix.

  - For instance, represent "aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group within three carbons" as a SMARTS pattern: `C(=O)[O-][C][C][N]` or similar, adjusted for specificity.

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify Functional Group Distances Numerically**

  Replace qualitative descriptions of functional group positions (e.g., "within three carbons") with numerical descriptors that count the exact number of atoms between functional groups and the carboxyl group. This numeric data can be directly used in feature matrices.

  - Calculate path lengths between the carboxyl carbon and heteroatoms (N, O, S) in the molecule using cheminformatics libraries.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Electronic Descriptors**

  For rules involving electronic effects (Rules 2 and 3), assign numerical values to substituents based on their electronic properties, such as Hammett sigma constants or electronegativity values. Include these descriptors in the feature matrix to quantify the impact of electron-withdrawing or donating groups.

- **Advice 5**: **Standardize Terminology for Clarity**

  Remove ambiguous terms like "bulky substituents" or "interfering groups." Instead, define clear, quantifiable criteria such as:

  - Steric hindrance quantified by molecular volume or steric parameters (e.g., Charton or Taft steric constants).
  - Explicit structural features, such as the presence of substituents larger than a specified number of heavy atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 6**: **Focus on Detectable Functional Groups and Substructures**

  Center the rules around functional groups and substructures that can be directly detected from SMILES strings, such as:

  - Presence of specific rings (aromatic, heterocyclic with nitrogen).
  - Specific substituents at defined positions (e.g., para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups on benzene rings).

- **Advice 7**: **Create a Hierarchical Rule Structure**

  Organize the rules hierarchically to prioritize the most impactful features:

  - **Primary Rules**: Presence of functional groups critical for coordination (e.g., amino or hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group).
  - **Secondary Rules**: Electronic effects from substituents.
  - **Tertiary Rules**: Steric factors and other modifiers.

  This hierarchy aids in the stepwise evaluation of each modifier and simplifies computational processing.

- **Advice 8**: **Develop a Numerical Feature Matrix Based on Molecular Descriptors**

  Generate a comprehensive feature matrix using molecular descriptors that capture the essence of the rules:

  - **Binary Features**: Presence (1) or absence (0) of specific functional groups or substructures.
  - **Numeric Features**: Distances between functional groups, steric parameters, electronic descriptors.

  Use cheminformatics libraries (e.g., RDKit) to calculate these descriptors from SMILES strings.

- **Advice 9**: **Validate and Refine Rules Using Machine Learning**

  Employ machine learning techniques to validate the effectiveness of the rules:

  - Use the feature matrix to train classification models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to predict high or low yield.
  - Analyze feature importance scores to identify the most impactful descriptors.
  - Refine the rules based on model insights, ensuring they align with both chemical intuition and computational findings.

- **Advice 10**: **Include Exceptions and Special Cases Explicitly**

  Identify and explicitly state any exceptions or outliers that do not fit the generalized rules:

  - For example, if certain modifiers like **octanoic acid** result in high yield despite lacking traditional coordinating groups, note this exception and explore underlying reasons (e.g., hydrophobic interactions).

- **Advice 11**: **Document Rules with Examples and Counterexamples**

  For each rule, provide clear examples and counterexamples along with their SMILES representations:

  - This aids in verifying the rules computationally and ensures that the rule set can be used to programmatically classify new modifiers.

- **Advice 12**: **Ensure Compatibility with Cheminformatics Tools**

  Test the rules on a subset of the dataset using cheminformatics software to confirm that they can be applied seamlessly:

  - Adjust the rules based on any computational challenges encountered, ensuring they are practical for automated processing.

- **Advice 13**: **Enhance Rules with Physicochemical Properties**

  Incorporate additional physicochemical properties into the rules where relevant:

  - Properties like logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (tPSA), and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor counts may correlate with yield and are easily computed from SMILES.

- **Advice 14**: **Use Data-Driven Approaches to Discover New Rules**

  Analyze the dataset statistically to uncover patterns not captured by the current rules:

  - Perform clustering or association rule mining to detect new relationships between molecular features and yield outcomes.
  - Integrate these findings into the rule set to improve its predictive accuracy.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), or thiol (-SH) groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. These proximal polar groups enhance chelation with the metal center, improving catalyst performance.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups in the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂), bromo (-Br), or amino (-NH₂)**, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups in the para position**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)**, result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing coordination efficiency.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
   - **Non-examples (High Yield)**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole rings**, result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups** result in a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups enhance chelation and coordination with the metal center.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups located more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The increased distance reduces effective chelation with the metal center.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains near the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Example (Low Yield)**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups** relative to the carboxyl group on aromatic rings result in a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of coordinating sites to the metal center.

   - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with indole side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, result in a **high yield**. The indole ring may participate in π interactions with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
   - **Non-example (Low Yield)**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The simple structure allows unimpeded coordination with the metal center.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **Octanoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **polyether chains or flexible linkers bearing amino (-NH₂) or methoxy (-OCH₃) groups distant from the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and distance reduce effective chelation with the metal center.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **aromatic rings**, result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance affecting metal coordination.

    - **Example (Low Yield)**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids containing formyl (-CHO) groups** result in a **low yield**. The formyl group may interfere with metal coordination or engage in intramolecular interactions.

    - **Examples (Low Yield)**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing sulfur groups (-SH) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. Sulfur atoms enhance coordination with the metal center.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy (-OCH₃) groups in the meta or para position** result in a **high yield**. Methoxy groups can participate in electron donation, influencing metal coordination.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
    - **Non-example (Low Yield)**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Ensure that the SMARTS pattern variables are accessible within each rule function**. Currently, variables like `carboxylic_acid_pat`, `amino_group_pat`, etc., are defined outside the `apply_rule_x` functions. Inside these functions, these variables may not be accessible due to scope limitations. To fix this, declare these variables as `global` within each function or pass them as parameters to the functions. For example:
  ```python
  def apply_rule_1(mol):
      global carboxylic_acid_pat, amino_group_pat, hydroxyl_group_pat, thiol_group_pat
      # Rest of the function code...
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: **Remove the broad `try...except` blocks that catch all exceptions in the `apply_rule_x` functions**. These blocks suppress errors that could help identify issues in the code. Instead, allow exceptions to be raised so you can pinpoint and resolve any problems. Only catch specific exceptions if necessary and handle them appropriately.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Add debugging statements within the `apply_rule_x` functions to verify that substructure matches are occurring as expected**. For instance, print the number and indices of matches found for each SMARTS pattern. This will help you confirm whether the patterns are matching the intended functional groups in each molecule. Example:
  ```python
  def apply_rule_1(mol):
      carboxyl_carbons = [match[0] for match in mol.GetSubstructMatches(carboxylic_acid_pat)]
      print(f"Carboxyl carbons found: {carboxyl_carbons}")
      # Rest of the function code...
  ```

- **Suggestion 4**: **Verify that the SMARTS patterns accurately represent the functional groups described in the natural language rules**. For example, check if `carboxylic_acid_pat = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]')` matches all carboxylic acids, including cases where the acid might be deprotonated. You may need to adjust patterns to include all relevant forms, such as:
  ```python
  carboxylic_acid_pat = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')
  ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **Ensure that the methods used to determine distances between functional groups are accurate**. When using `Chem.GetShortestPath`, confirm that it correctly reflects the chemical distances (number of bonds) you're interested in. Also, check that the bond counts align with the way you're defining proximity in the rules (e.g., within three bonds).

- **Suggestion 6**: **Double-check the logic used to identify substituents at specific positions on aromatic rings**. For rules involving meta, ortho, or para positions, ensure that the code correctly calculates the positions relative to the reference atom. Validate this by testing with known molecules where the substituent positions are clear.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Test each `apply_rule_x` function individually with molecules that should match**. For instance, test `apply_rule_1` with aspartic acid to see if it returns `True`. This will help you isolate issues within specific rule implementations.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Verify that all SMILES strings are correctly parsed into molecules**. Check that `mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi)` does not return `None` for any of the SMILES in your list. If parsing fails, there may be issues with the SMILES syntax that need correction.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Update the code to handle deprotonated forms and tautomers if necessary**. Some molecules might exist in different ionic forms. Consider using RDKit's tautomer enumeration tools or adjust the SMARTS patterns to be more inclusive.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Refactor the code for better structure and readability**. For instance, define all SMARTS patterns within a dictionary or class that can be accessed by all functions. Pass necessary patterns as parameters to functions to avoid relying on global variables.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance:**

Upon reviewing the current rule metrics in comparison to the reference metrics, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the rules, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**.

**1. Decrease in Support:**

- **Reference Metrics:** The previous rule metrics indicate an average **train support** ranging between **0.1667** and **0.1845**, suggesting that approximately 16.67% to 18.45% of the training data supports the rules.
- **Current Metrics:** The **train support** has decreased progressively over the iterations, reaching **0.0** in the latest iteration.
- **Implication:** A train support of **0.0** indicates that none of the training data supports the current set of rules. This significant drop suggests that the rules may have become too specific or are no longer capturing any patterns within the data.

**2. Decline in Confidence:**

- **Reference Metrics:** The previous average **train confidence** values were **0.6352** and **0.5396**, indicating a reasonably strong confidence in the rules' predictions.
- **Current Metrics:** The **train confidence** has decreased to **0.5** in the latest iteration.
- **Implication:** A confidence level of **0.5** means the rules predict the outcome correctly only half the time. This reduction from the reference confidence levels implies that the rules have lost predictive power.

**3. Lift Value at Unity:**

- **Reference Metrics:** The previous **train lift** values averaged **1.2048** and **1.0559**, indicating that the rules were somewhat effective in improving the prediction over random chance.
- **Current Metrics:** The **train lift** is now **1.0**.
- **Implication:** A lift of **1.0** suggests that the rule's predictive ability is no better than random chance. The rule does not provide any additional information to improve the prediction of the outcome.

**4. Leverage Reduced to Zero:**

- **Reference Metrics:** The previous **train leverage** values were **0.0289** and **-0.0041**, indicating some degree of association between the rule conditions and the predictions.
- **Current Metrics:** The **train leverage** is now **0.0**.
- **Implication:** A leverage of **0.0** means there is no additional support for the rule beyond what would be expected by random chance. This further confirms that the current rules are not effectively capturing any meaningful associations.

**Assessment of Iterations and Local Minimum:**

The continuous decline in support, confidence, and lift over the iterations indicates that the rule refinement process may have reached a **local minimum**. The rules have become overly specific, resulting in a lack of generalization to the data. Given that the metrics have plateaued at unsatisfactory values (e.g., confidence at **0.5** and lift at **1.0**), this suggests that further iterations using the current approach may not yield improvements.

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules:**

1. **Re-examine Rule Specificity:**

   - **Issue:** The current rules may be too narrowly defined, limiting their applicability across the dataset.
   - **Solution:** Broaden the rules to encompass a wider range of data points. Avoid overly complex conditions that apply to very few instances. Focus on identifying key functional groups or structural features that have a significant impact on the yield.

2. **Increase Rule Support:**

   - **Issue:** Low support indicates that the rules apply to a minimal portion of the dataset.
   - **Solution:** Identify patterns or attributes that are more prevalent in the data. This could involve aggregating similar modifiers or generalizing certain structural features to capture more instances.

3. **Enhance Predictive Confidence:**

   - **Issue:** A confidence level of **0.5** is inadequate for reliable predictions.
   - **Solution:** Adjust the rules to target combinations of conditions that have historically resulted in higher confidence values. This might involve combining multiple beneficial features or excluding confounding factors that reduce confidence.

4. **Improve Lift Values:**

   - **Issue:** A lift of **1.0** signifies no predictive advantage.
   - **Solution:** Focus on rules that significantly increase the probability of a high yield compared to the baseline. This requires identifying features that are strongly associated with high yields but are not common in the dataset.

5. **Avoid Overfitting:**

   - **Issue:** Overly complex rules may fit the training data too closely, failing to generalize.
   - **Solution:** Simplify the rules to capture essential patterns. Employ cross-validation techniques to ensure the rules perform well on unseen data.

6. **Incorporate Statistical Validation:**

   - **Issue:** Reliance solely on training metrics may not accurately reflect rule performance.
   - **Solution:** Use a hold-out test set or employ k-fold cross-validation to validate the rules. Evaluate performance metrics on both training and validation sets to assess generalizability.

7. **Iterative Refinement with Feedback:**

   - **Issue:** Current iterations may not be incorporating feedback effectively.
   - **Solution:** After each iteration, analyze which rules perform poorly and understand why. Gather insights from domain experts to guide the refinement process.

**Conclusion:**

The current analysis suggests that the performance of the rules has diminished over successive iterations, potentially reaching a local minimum. To address this, it's essential to revisit the rule development strategy. By broadening the applicability of the rules, focusing on key predictive features, and ensuring they generalize well across the data, the overall performance can be improved. Implementing the recommendations above should help enhance confidence and lift, leading to more robust and effective rules for predicting catalytic yield.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results and the provided data, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current rules in predicting the catalytic modifier loading:

1. **Decline in Model Accuracy**:
   - The latest model accuracy is **42.86%**, which is significantly lower than previous iterations where accuracies ranged from approximately **54%** to **71%**.
   - This decline suggests that the current rules are not effectively capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

2. **Lack of Rule Contribution**:
   - The SHAP analysis for the latest iteration shows that **only Rule 15** had SHAP values listed, and all of these values are **zero**.
   - This indicates that **none of the rules are contributing to the model's predictions**. The model is likely defaulting to a baseline prediction without considering the features derived from the rules.

3. **Comparison with Previous Iterations**:
   - In earlier iterations, multiple rules had non-zero SHAP values, indicating active contributions to the model's predictions.
   - Those iterations also had higher accuracies, suggesting that the rules were more effective in capturing relevant features.

4. **Potential Underfitting**:
   - The fact that the model's accuracy has decreased and SHAP values are zero implies that the model is **underfitting**.
   - Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data, possibly due to an insufficient number of effective features or overly generalized rules.

5. **Possible Reasons for Performance Decline**:
   - **Rule Simplification or Removal**: If rules were simplified or removed in the latest iteration, this could have led to the lack of feature contribution.
   - **Over-Generalization**: The current rules might be too general, failing to capture specific patterns necessary for accurate predictions.
   - **Data Imbalance**: An imbalance in the distribution of high and low modifier loadings in the dataset could also affect model performance.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the effectiveness of the current rules and improve model performance, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Reassess and Refine Rules with Zero SHAP Values**:
   - **Reevaluate Rule 15**: Since Rule 15 is the only rule present in the SHAP analysis but with zero contribution, it should be reexamined for relevance and specificity.
   - **Reintroduce Effective Rules**: Reconsider adding back rules that previously showed significant contribution (non-zero SHAP values) and were associated with higher accuracies.

2. **Analyze Rules with Previous High SHAP Values**:
   - **Identify Problematic Rules**: In earlier iterations, certain rules had high positive SHAP values for molecules where the predicted loading was high but the experimental value was low (overestimation). For instance:
     - **Rule 2**: Often had high positive SHAP values in overestimations.
     - **Rule 7**: Occasionally contributed to incorrect high predictions.
   - **Adjust These Rules**:
     - **Modify Rule Conditions**: Adjust thresholds or conditions within these rules to reduce overestimations.
     - **Incorporate Additional Factors**: Introduce additional molecular descriptors to refine the rule's applicability.

3. **Address Rules with High Negative SHAP Values**:
   - **Rules Causing Underestimation**: Rules that had high negative SHAP values in cases where the predicted loading was low but the experimental value was high should be adjusted to prevent underestimation.
     - **Example**: If Rule 6 consistently had high negative SHAP values in such cases, consider modifying it to be less strict or to account for exceptions.

4. **Enhance Rule Specificity and Coverage**:
   - **Increase Specificity**: Ensure that rules are specific enough to capture important chemical nuances without being overly general.
   - **Improve Coverage**: Add new rules to cover molecular features not currently addressed, especially for misclassified molecules.

5. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors**:
   - Utilize descriptors such as **hydrophobicity (log P)**, **molar refractivity**, or **topological polar surface area (tPSA)** to enrich the feature set.
   - Enhanced descriptors can help the model differentiate molecules more effectively, potentially improving accuracy.

6. **Perform Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Beyond SHAP values, conduct a comprehensive feature importance analysis to identify which features (rules) contribute most to model performance.
   - Use this analysis to prioritize which rules to refine or expand upon.

7. **Balance Model Complexity**:
   - Avoid overfitting by keeping the model complexity appropriate for the dataset size.
   - Ensure that the rules are neither too simplistic (leading to underfitting) nor too complex (leading to overfitting).

8. **Iterative Testing and Validation**:
   - After modifying the rules, retrain the model and evaluate performance.
   - Use cross-validation to assess the model's generalization ability.
   - Continue iterating until the model's accuracy stabilizes and SHAP values indicate meaningful feature contributions.

9. **Consider Data Augmentation or Collection**:
   - **Augment Dataset**: If possible, expand the dataset with additional experimental data to improve model training.
   - **Address Data Imbalance**: Ensure that the dataset has a balanced representation of high and low modifier loadings to prevent model bias.

10. **Leverage Domain Expertise**:
    - Collaborate with chemists or material scientists to gain insights into why certain modifiers perform as they do.
    - Use this knowledge to refine rules or develop new ones that are grounded in chemical theory.

**Specific Rule Adjustments Based on SHAP Insights**

- **Rule 2**: Since Rule 2 often had high positive SHAP values in overestimations, consider refining the types of electron-withdrawing groups or their positions on the aromatic ring. Perhaps not all electron-withdrawing groups contribute equally to high yield.

- **Rule 6**: Given that Rule 6 might contribute to underestimations, reassess the distance criteria for amino or hydroxyl groups relative to the carboxyl group. Maybe modifiers with these groups slightly further away still contribute to high yield.

- **Rule 7**: The impact of fluorinated alkyl chains might be more nuanced. Consider differentiating between degrees of fluorination or the chain length in the rule.

- **Rule 15**: Since Rule 15 showed zero SHAP values in the latest iteration, evaluate its relevance. If methoxy groups in certain positions do not consistently lead to high yield, the rule may need modification or removal.

**Conclusion**

The current rules, in their latest form, are not effectively capturing the factors that influence the modifier loading on the catalyst, as evidenced by the low model accuracy and the lack of contribution from the rules (indicated by zero SHAP values). By refining existing rules based on SHAP analysis insights, reintroducing previously effective rules, and enhancing the specificity and coverage of the rules, the model's predictive performance can be improved. Iterative testing, combined with domain expertise, will be essential in developing a robust set of rules that accurately predict catalytic performance.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current set of rules for predicting the catalytic modifier loading on the catalyst has been analyzed through multiple iterations, and several key issues have been identified:

1. **Decline in Model Performance**:
   - **Accuracy**: The model's accuracy has significantly decreased to **42.86%**, indicating poor predictive capability.
   - **SHAP Analysis**: The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values reveal that only **Rule 15** is present, and its contribution is effectively **zero**. This suggests that the current rules are not contributing meaningfully to the model’s predictions.

2. **Decreased Rule Effectiveness**:
   - **Support, Confidence, and Lift**: The metrics show a decline over iterations:
     - **Support** has decreased to **0.0**, implying that none of the training data supports the rules.
     - **Confidence** has fallen to **0.5**, indicating that the rules are correct only half the time.
     - **Lift** is at **1.0**, showing no improvement over random chance.

3. **Possible Over-Specificity and Underfitting**:
   - The current rules may have become **too specific** or **over-generalized**, leading to a lack of generalization across the dataset.
   - The model appears to be **underfitting**, failing to capture the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

To address the identified issues and optimize the current rules, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Reassess and Refine Existing Rules**:
   - **Rule 15**: Given its zero SHAP values and lack of contribution, reevaluate its relevance. If methoxy groups in certain positions do not consistently lead to high yield, consider modifying or removing this rule.
   - **Rule 2**: Since it often had high positive SHAP values in cases of overestimations, refine the rule by reassessing the types and positions of electron-withdrawing groups. Not all electron-withdrawing groups may contribute equally to high yields.
   - **Rule 6**: Reconsider the distance criteria for amino or hydroxyl groups relative to the carboxyl group. The rule might be too restrictive, excluding modifiers that still contribute positively despite a slightly greater distance.
   - **Rule 7**: Investigate the nuanced effects of fluorinated alkyl chains. Different degrees of fluorination or chain lengths might influence the yield differently.

2. **Increase Rule Support and Coverage**:
   - **Broaden Rule Applicability**: Avoid overly narrow conditions that apply to very few data points. Generalize rules where appropriate to cover more modifiers.
   - **Include Additional Functional Groups**: Identify and incorporate other functional groups or structural features that may influence yield (e.g., ether groups, additional heterocycles).

3. **Enhance Rule Specificity without Overfitting**:
   - **Balance Specificity and Generalization**: Ensure that rules are specific enough to capture important chemical nuances but not so narrow that they fail to generalize.
   - **Avoid Overly Complex Conditions**: Simplify rules to prevent overfitting. Rules should be based on clear, chemically meaningful patterns.

4. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors**:
   - **Physicochemical Properties**: Introduce descriptors such as hydrophobicity (log P), molar refractivity, topological polar surface area (tPSA), and molecular weight.
   - **Electronic Factors**: Consider Hammett sigma constants or other electronic descriptors to quantify the effects of substituents.

5. **Utilize Statistical Validation Techniques**:
   - **Cross-Validation**: Employ k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's generalization performance.
   - **Hold-Out Test Set**: Use an independent test set to evaluate the model, ensuring that the rules perform well on unseen data.

6. **Refine SMARTS Patterns and Code Implementation**:
   - **Verify SMARTS Accuracy**: Ensure that SMARTS patterns accurately represent the intended functional groups and account for different ionic forms or tautomers.
   - **Improve Code Structure**: Avoid scope issues by passing necessary variables as parameters or using object-oriented approaches to manage patterns and functions.
   - **Remove Overly Broad Exception Handling**: Allow exceptions to be raised to better identify and fix issues in the code.

7. **Iterative Testing and Feedback**:
   - **Test Rules Individually**: Validate each rule with molecules known to match or not match to ensure they behave as expected.
   - **Incorporate Domain Expertise**: Consult with chemists or material scientists to provide insights into chemical behaviors that may not be captured by the current rules.

8. **Address Data Imbalance and Augmentation**:
   - **Balance Dataset**: Ensure an even representation of high and low yields in the dataset to prevent model bias.
   - **Expand Dataset**: If possible, include additional experimental data to improve the robustness of the model.

9. **Perform Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - **Identify Key Contributors**: Use feature importance metrics to determine which rules significantly impact the model's predictions.
   - **Focus on Effective Rules**: Prioritize refining rules that contribute most to the model's performance.

10. **Adjust Model Complexity**:
    - **Regularization Techniques**: Apply regularization to prevent overfitting while allowing the model to capture necessary complexity.
    - **Simplify Model if Necessary**: If the model is too complex relative to the dataset size, consider simplifying it to improve generalization.

**Possibility for Further Optimization without Overfitting**

Given the analysis and the suggestions provided, there is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Underfitting Concerns**: The current model appears to be underfitting, indicating that it is too simple to capture the necessary patterns. Introducing more relevant features and refining existing rules can address this issue.

- **Rule Refinement**: By adjusting and enhancing the specificity of the rules based on SHAP analysis and domain knowledge, the model can better capture the relationships between molecular features and catalytic performance.

- **Controlled Complexity**: By carefully balancing rule specificity and model complexity, we can improve predictive performance without overfitting.
