**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows us to predict high yield when a benzoic acid derivative has an electron-withdrawing group at the para position. It demonstrates property insight, considering the influence of electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic systems. The rule combines substructures (benzoic acid core and para substituent) and is supported by two data points (Entries 1 and 20), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly states that benzoic acid derivatives with electron-donating groups at the para position result in low yield. This reflects good property insight into how electron-donating groups affect reactivity. The rule combines substructures and is supported by two data points (Entries 22 and 26), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 suggests that aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar groups lead to high yield. While the rule is clear and provides some property insight, it is only supported by a single data point (Entry 4). The limited coverage weakens the rule's reliability and suggests that more examples are needed to confirm it.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 indicates that aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups result in low yield. The rule is clear and combines substructures effectively. It has strong coverage, supported by multiple data points (Entries 29, 31, and 34), and demonstrates good property insight into how polar groups may interfere with the reaction.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 states that modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain lead to high yield. Although the rule is clear and considers a complex combination of substructures, it is only supported by one data point (Entry 8). The limited coverage reduces confidence in this rule.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 differentiates between thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) and thiol groups on aromatic rings (low yield). This rule is clear, shows property insight, and considers combinations of substructures. It is supported by two data points (Entries 17 and 9), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 indicates that modifiers with aldehyde groups tend to result in low yield. The rule is clear and provides property insight into the reactivity of aldehyde groups. It is supported by two data points (Entries 19 and 18), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 indicates that heterocyclic aromatic carboxylic acids lead to high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring. The rule is clear, shows property insight, and considers combinations of substructures. It is supported by two data points (Entries 15 and 21), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 suggests that modifiers with amide linkages between aromatic rings and carboxylic acids result in low yield. The rule is clear, considers complex substructures, and is supported by two data points (Entries 26 and 23). This meets the coverage requirement and reflects property insight into how amide linkages may affect reactivity.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that modifiers with ketone groups on aliphatic chains adjacent to carboxylic acids result in low yield. While the rule is clear and offers property insight, it is only supported by one data point (Entry 27), which limits its reliability due to insufficient coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 indicates that modifiers containing long polyether chains result in low yield. The rule is clear and considers complex substructures but is supported by only one data point (Entry 10). The limited coverage suggests that additional data are needed to validate this rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 suggests that amino acids with aromatic side chains lead to high yield. The rule is clear and combines substructures effectively. However, it is supported by only one data point (Entry 14), which means coverage is insufficient to confirm the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 states that modifiers with pyridine rings connected through an alkyl chain to a carboxylic acid lead to high yield. The rule is clear and considers complex substructures but is only supported by one data point (Entry 24), indicating limited coverage.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 indicates that modifiers with electron-donating groups on aliphatic chains tend to result in low yield. The rule is clear, combines substructures, and shows property insight. It is supported by multiple data points (Entries 29 and 31), meeting the coverage criterion.

The rule is supported by at least two data points (Entries 1 and 20), meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and specifies that benzoic acid derivatives with aldehyde groups result in low yield.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups distant from the carboxyl group result in low yield. The rule is clear and offers physicochemical insight. It combines positional and functional group considerations, satisfying complexity. Nonetheless, it is supported by only one data point (Entry 27), not meeting the coverage requirement.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows prediction of the yield based on electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups at the para position of benzoic acid derivatives. It provides property insight into how electronic effects influence the reaction. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by 5 data points (Entries 1, 9, 19, 20, 22), offering good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear, specifying that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring lead to high yield. It provides property insight into the electronic effects of direct attachment. The rule considers combinations of functional groups and is supported by 3 high-yield data points (Entries 7, 15, 21) and one low-yield counterexample (Entry 11), offering acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly states the impact of chain length on yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups. It offers property insight into steric effects and coordination ability. The rule considers combinations of functional groups and chain length, and is supported by 4 data points (Entries 0, 2, 31, 34), providing acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 suggests that unsubstituted long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (≥8 carbons) without additional functional groups lead to high yield. However, the rule is only supported by a single data point (Entry 4 - octanoic acid), which is insufficient coverage per the criteria. Additional data points are needed to validate the rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 addresses modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups leading to high yield and those with a single hydroxyl group leading to low yield. While the rule is clear and offers property insight into hydrogen-bonding capabilities, it is supported by only one high-yield data point (Entry 8) and one low-yield data point (Entry 29). This insufficient coverage weakens the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 states that thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield, while thiol groups on aromatic rings result in low yield. The rule is clear and provides property insight into coordination abilities. However, it is supported by only one data point for each case (Entries 17 and 9), which is insufficient coverage to firmly establish the rule.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, indicating that modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield. It offers property insight related to electron-withdrawing effects and potential steric hindrance. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by 2 data points (Entries 13 and 28), providing acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 states that modifiers with extended ether linkages result in low yield. The rule is clear and offers property insight regarding solubility and coordination effects. It considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by 2 data points (Entries 10 and 32), offering acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 specifies that modifiers with aromatic rings connected via amide linkages to carboxylic acids result in low yield. The rule is clear and provides property insight into steric hindrance and coordination issues. It combines sub-structures and is supported by 2 data points (Entries 23 and 26), providing acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 differentiates between amino acids with indole side chains (high yield) and phenyl side chains (low yield). While clear and insightful regarding electronic effects, it is supported by only one data point for each case (Entries 14 and 12). This insufficient coverage undermines the rule's strength.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 relates yield to the length of aliphatic chains connecting aromatic rings to carboxylic acids. It is clear and offers property insight into steric effects. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by 3 data points (Entries 6, 24, 30), providing acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 suggests that modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings and connected via aliphatic chains lead to high yield. While the rule is clear and provides property insight, it is supported by only one data point (Entry 25), which is insufficient for strong coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with distant ketone groups result in low yield. The rule is clear but is only supported by one data point (Entry 27), providing insufficient coverage according to the criteria.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 indicates that modifiers containing fused aromatic systems or benzofuran derivatives result in high yield. Despite the rule being clear and offering property insight, it is based on a single data point (Entry 16), which is insufficient for adequate coverage.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 asserts that N-acetylated amino acids result in low yield. The rule is clear and provides property insight, but it is supported by only one data point (Entry 33), rendering coverage insufficient.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows for straightforward identification of modifiers that will result in high yield based on the presence of a carboxylic acid directly attached to a heteroaromatic ring. The property insight is strong, as the heteroaromatic system may influence electronic properties favorable for the reaction. The rule effectively combines specific functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. Supported by multiple examples (Entries 21, 15, 7, 16) and a counterexample (Entry 11), it has good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** distinctly separates modifiers based on chain length and the presence of polar groups. It's clear and provides property insight into how polar substituents may interfere with the reaction. The rule considers both chain length and functional group presence, adding complexity. With support from one high-yield example (Entry 4) and several low-yield counterexamples (Entries 29, 31, 34), it meets the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear in distinguishing between polyhydroxy acids and monohydroxy acids. The property insight suggests that multiple hydroxyl groups enhance interaction with the catalyst or substrate. Complexity is addressed by considering the number of hydroxyl groups on the aliphatic chain. Supported by high-yield examples (Entries 8, 5) and a low-yield counterexample (Entry 29), coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** clearly states the impact of thiol group positioning on yield. The property insight is logical, as the proximity of thiol groups to the carboxylic acid may influence coordination with metal centers. Complexity arises from considering both the functional group and its location. With a high-yield example (Entry 17) and a low-yield counterexample (Entry 9), the rule has acceptable coverage despite the limited number of data points.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear and focuses on fluorinated alkyl chains leading to low yield. The property insight relates to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms affecting reactivity. While the rule is less complex, dealing with a single functional group, it is supported by multiple low-yield examples (Entries 13, 28), providing good coverage.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** provides a clear correlation between chain length of amino-substituted acids and yield. The property insight is reasonable, as shorter chains may favor better interaction with the active site. Complexity is added by combining functional groups with chain length criteria. Supported by high-yield examples (Entries 2, 0) and low-yield counterexamples (Entries 31, 34), it has strong coverage.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear in stating that extended ether linkages result in low yield. The property insight is limited, but it may relate to steric hindrance or solubility issues. Complexity is minimal, focusing on a specific structural motif. Supported by low-yield examples (Entries 10, 32), coverage is sufficient though could be improved with more data points.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly identifies modifiers with aromatic rings connected via amide linkages as leading to low yield. The property insight is acceptable, considering that amide bonds may alter electronic distribution. Complexity is present through the combination of functional groups and linkages. With support from low-yield examples (Entries 26, 23), coverage meets the criteria.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** distinctly differentiates yield outcomes based on the nature of aromatic side chains in amino acids. The property insight into how indole rings may enhance interactions compared to phenyl rings adds value. Complexity is addressed through the combination of amino acid structure and side-chain type. Although supported by one high-yield example (Entry 14) and one low-yield counterexample (Entry 12), coverage is limited and could be strengthened with additional data.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear regarding the relationship between aliphatic chain length connecting aromatic rings to carboxylic acids and yield. Property insight is modest but suggests that longer chains may improve flexibility or positioning. Complexity arises from considering both chain length and functional groups. Supported by high-yield examples (Entries 6, 24) and a low-yield counterexample (Entry 30), coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** specifies that ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings connected via aliphatic chains lead to high yield. While clear and complex due to the specific structure, the property insight is limited without further explanation. With only one supporting example (Entry 25), coverage is weak, suggesting the rule may need more data for validation.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** clearly states that fused aromatic systems or benzofuran derivatives result in high yield. The property insight may relate to the unique electronic properties of fused systems. Complexity is adequate, but with only one supporting example (Entry 16), coverage is limited, and the rule may require additional evidence.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** is clear in identifying modifiers with aldehyde groups on aromatic rings as leading to low yield. The property insight is reasonable, considering aldehydes may participate in side reactions. Complexity is low, focusing on a single functional group. Supported by low-yield examples (Entries 19, 18), the rule meets the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** clearly states that N-acetylated amino acids result in low yield. The property insight is acceptable, as acetylation may hinder interaction with the catalyst. Complexity is minimal, involving a single modification. With only one low-yield example (Entry 33), coverage is limited, and the rule could benefit from more data.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** effectively highlights that para-substituted benzoic acids with amino groups lead to high yield. The property insight is interesting, noting that electron-donating amino groups may enhance yield. Complexity is moderate, considering both substitution position and functional groups. Supported by a high-yield example (Entry 3) and low-yield counterexamples (Entries 22, 9), coverage is satisfactory.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position tend to result in _high_ yield.

  - **Clarity**: The rule is clear and specific, identifying aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position as leading to high yields. One can easily determine if a modifier fits this description.
  - **Property Insight**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and can enhance coordination with metal catalysts like Fe, potentially stabilizing reaction intermediates.
  - **Complexity**: The rule appropriately combines multiple structural features—aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, para substitution, and electron-withdrawing groups.
  - **Coverage**: Supported by at least three data points (Entries 1, 3, and 20) showing high yield, with relevant counterexamples (Entry 22 and 19) demonstrating low yield when the substituents are electron-donating or interfere differently.
  - **Balance**: The rule strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage, capturing an important trend in the data without being overly complex.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents at the para position tend to result in _low_ yield.

  - **Clarity**: The rule is clear and allows for straightforward classification of modifiers based on their substituents.
  - **Property Insight**: Electron-donating groups can decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid and may hinder effective coordination with the catalyst.
  - **Complexity**: It combines structural elements of the aromatic carboxylic acid and the nature of the substituent (electron-donating), adding appropriate complexity.
  - **Coverage**: Supported by at least two data points (Entries 9 and 22) with low yields. However, **4-Aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 3) is a counterexample, as the amino group is typically electron-donating but results in a high yield.
  - **Balance**: While the rule generally holds, the counterexample suggests that amino groups may have additional interactions (e.g., coordination with Fe) that override the general trend, indicating the need for refinement.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to heteroaromatic rings (e.g., pyridine) tend to result in _high_ yield.

  - **Clarity**: The structural criterion is clear and unambiguous.
  - **Property Insight**: Heteroaromatic rings like pyridine can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.
  - **Complexity**: The rule captures the combined effect of heteroaromatic rings and carboxylic acid groups.
  - **Coverage**: Supported by at least three data points (Entries 7, 15, and 21) with high yields. The counterexample (Entry 11) strengthens the rule by showing that when the carboxyl group is not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring, the yield is low.
  - **Balance**: Good balance between complexity and coverage, with sufficient examples and consideration of structural nuances.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium to long unbranched chains (≥6 carbons) without additional polar functional groups tend to result in _high_ yield; the presence of polar groups reduces yield.

  - **Clarity**: The rule clearly defines the chain length and the absence of polar groups.
  - **Property Insight**: Longer aliphatic chains without polar groups may favor hydrophobic interactions and optimal positioning in the catalytic site.
  - **Complexity**: Considers both chain length and the presence/absence of polar functional groups.

  - **Balance**: Well-balanced with a strong correlation between structure and observed yields.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with short chains (≤5 carbons) containing amino groups tend to result in _high_ yield; those with longer chains result in _low_ yield.

  - **Clarity**: The rule is specific about chain length and the presence of amino groups.
  - **Property Insight**: Short-chain amino acids may enhance catalyst coordination without introducing steric hindrance.
  - **Complexity**: Combines chain length and functional group presence, adding appropriate complexity.
  - **Coverage**: Supported by high-yield examples (Entries 0 and 2) and low-yield examples (Entries 31 and 34).
  - **Balance**: Adequate balance, with clear structural distinctions correlating with yield outcomes.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield differently based on the ring type: indole-containing side chains result in _high_ yield; phenyl-containing side chains result in _low_ yield.

  - **Clarity**: Clearly distinguishes between indole and phenyl side chains.
  - **Property Insight**: Indole rings may have enhanced interactions with the catalyst due to their electron-rich nature compared to phenyl rings.
  - **Complexity**: Considers both the amino acid backbone and the nature of the aromatic side chain.
  - **Coverage**: Supported by high-yield (Entry 14) and low-yield (Entry 12) data points.
  - **Balance**: The rule effectively explains the differing yields based on aromatic side chain structure.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains (polyhydroxy acids) tend to result in _high_ yield; those with only a single hydroxyl group or with ether linkages tend to result in _low_ yield.

  - **Clarity**: The distinction between multiple hydroxyl groups versus single hydroxyl or ethers is clear.
  - **Property Insight**: Multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance solubility and interactions with the catalyst, while ethers may decrease reactivity.
