Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in specifying that short-chain aliphatic amino acids (3-5 carbons, no aromatic rings) yield high, while longer chains (6+ carbons) yield low. The structural criteria are well-defined, and the examples in the dataset support the rule, with multiple data points on each side. The rule provides property insight by implicating chain length as a factor influencing yield, possibly due to steric or electronic effects. The complexity is appropriate; it considers both chain length and the absence of aromatic rings. Overall, the rule meets the criteria of clarity, property insight, complexity, and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 attempts to correlate para-substituent electronic effects with yield, stating that electron-withdrawing groups result in high yield, while electron-donating or bulky groups result in low yield. However, there are inconsistencies with this rule. For example, 4-aminobenzoic acid is listed as high yield, but the amino group is generally electron-donating. Similarly, 4-formylbenzoic acid, which contains an electron-withdrawing formyl group, is listed as low yield. This suggests a lack of clarity and property insight in the rule. The rule may need to be refined to accurately reflect the observed data. The complexity of the rule is acceptable, but the coverage is undermined by these inconsistencies.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in stating that heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high, supported by examples in the dataset. The property insight is sound, as heterocyclic compounds can coordinate with metal centers, potentially facilitating electron transfer in the catalytic process. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on heterocyclic structures. The rule is well-supported by data points, meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 states that long-chain (6-8 carbons) aliphatic carboxylic acids yield high, while amino-substituted analogs yield low. The rule is clear and offers property insight by suggesting that the addition of amino groups decreases yield due to increased polarity or interference with the catalyst. However, the coverage is limited, with only one data point (octanoic acid) supporting high yield for the unmodified long-chain acids. For the amino-substituted analogs, there are two data points showing low yield, which partially supports the rule. The rule's complexity is acceptable, but the limited coverage reduces its robustness.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 states that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups yield high, attributing this to enhanced solubility and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst. The rule is clear and provides reasonable property insight. However, the coverage is limited, with only two data points supporting the rule and no contrasting low-yield examples. The complexity is acceptable. To strengthen the rule, additional data points would be beneficial.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 states that modifiers with aldehyde groups yield low due to potential side reactions like Schiff base formation or catalyst poisoning. The rule is clear and offers property insight. However, the coverage is minimal, with only two data points supporting the rule. The rule's complexity is low. To enhance the rule's robustness, more data points and perhaps contrasting high-yield examples without aldehyde groups would be helpful.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 differentiates between thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) and aromatic rings (low yield). The rule is clear and offers plausible property insight. However, the coverage is very limited, with only one data point for each case. The rule's complexity is acceptable. To strengthen the rule, additional data points are needed to confirm the trend.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 states that modifiers with highly fluorinated aliphatic chains yield low due to hydrophobicity affecting interactions with catalytic sites. The rule is clear and offers reasonable property insight. However, the coverage is minimal, with only one data point supporting the rule. The complexity is low. Additional data points are needed to confirm this pattern.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 suggests that modifiers with extended conjugated aromatic systems yield high due to π-π stacking interactions. While the rule provides property insight, the term "extended conjugated aromatic systems" is somewhat vague and may lack clarity. The coverage is limited, with only two data points. The complexity is acceptable. To improve the rule, clearer definitions and more supporting data would be beneficial.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that modifiers with polyether chains yield low due to steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects. The rule is clear and offers property insight. However, the coverage is minimal, with only one data point. The complexity is acceptable. Additional examples are needed to support the rule.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that hydroxyphenyl groups with longer aliphatic linkers yield high, while those with shorter linkers yield low. The rule is clear and provides property insight. The complexity is appropriate, considering both chain length and functional groups. The coverage is minimal, with only one example for each case. More data points are needed to confirm this trend.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 suggests that modifiers with ketone groups near carboxylic acids yield low due to chelation with metal centers or interference with catalytic activity. The rule is clear and offers property insight. However, the coverage is minimal, with only one data point. The complexity is acceptable. More supporting data is needed.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents not conjugated with the carboxylic acid yield low. While the rule provides property insight, it may lack clarity due to the complexity of defining "not conjugated" in this context. The coverage is minimal, with only two data points. The complexity of the rule is high. Clarification and additional data points would strengthen the rule.

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in low yield. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and impede the reaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid – Low Yield

      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid – Low Yield

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows us to determine the yield based on the carbon chain length and the position of the amino group in aliphatic amino acids. It provides strong physical-chemical insight, attributing high yields to optimal coordination and minimal steric hindrance in shorter chains. The rule considers both chain length and functional groups, offering a good balance between complexity and coverage with multiple supporting data points.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is well-defined, focusing on para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating groups yielding high, and those with electron-donating or non-coordinating groups yielding low. It offers solid physical-chemical insight into how electron-withdrawing substituents enhance metal coordination. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage, supported by multiple data points that validate its applicability.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides clear guidance by identifying nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids as yielding high. It offers adequate physical-chemical insight into the role of nitrogen heterocycles in metal coordination. While the rule is clear and considers specific substructures, its coverage could be strengthened with additional data points, although it currently meets the minimum requirement.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is straightforward and clear, stating that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids yield high, while the addition of polar functional groups lowers the yield. The rule provides reasonable physical-chemical insight into how polar groups may alter solubility or interfere with catalyst coordination. It effectively balances complexity by considering both the absence and presence of functional groups and is well-supported by multiple data points.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 lacks sufficient coverage, with limited data points supporting the high yield for modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short chains. While it offers some physical-chemical insight into enhanced solubility and catalyst interaction, the rule's complexity may not justify its limited applicability. Additional data is needed to strengthen the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in distinguishing between aliphatic and aromatic thiol groups' effects on yield. However, the rule's coverage is minimal, relying on a single high-yield and one low-yield example. Despite providing physical-chemical insight into metal coordination and potential catalyst poisoning, the limited data reduces confidence in the rule's general applicability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 identifies that highly fluorinated aliphatic chains yield low, attributing this to reduced catalyst interaction due to electronegativity and hydrophobicity. The rule is clear but has very limited coverage with only one supporting data point. This minimal coverage hampers its effectiveness and reliability for broader application.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and supported by several data points showing that modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yield low. It offers adequate physical-chemical insight, suggesting possible chelation or side reactions with the catalyst. The rule balances complexity by focusing on specific functional group arrangements and has sufficient coverage to support its validity.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 has low coverage, supported by only one data point. While it introduces the concept that extended conjugation involving heterocycles yields high, the rule lacks clarity due to its vague description. The physical-chemical insight is plausible but not sufficiently detailed, and more data points are needed to validate this rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 discusses the impact of chain length in hydroxyphenyl-substituted aliphatic acids on yield. Despite offering some physical-chemical insight, the rule is based on minimal data, with only one high-yield and one low-yield example. The limited coverage and specificity reduce its reliability for predicting outcomes with new modifiers.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 addresses modifiers with polyether chains yielding low, suggesting steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects. The rule is clear but has insufficient coverage, supported by a single data point. This minimal support limits its applicability and confidence in the rule's generalizability.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear in stating that bulky non-coordinating substituents yield low. It provides reasonable physical-chemical insight into how steric hindrance may prevent proper catalyst interaction. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is supported by at least two data points, offering a balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 overlaps with Rule 2, focusing on aromatic rings with amino groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yielding high. While it provides adequate physical-chemical insight into enhanced metal coordination, the rule's coverage is limited to a single data point. The redundancy and minimal support reduce its added value beyond what is already covered in Rule 2.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is unclear and contains contradictory information. The rule states that modifiers with methoxy groups without coordinating substituents yield low, yet provides an example where such a compound yields high. This inconsistency undermines the rule's clarity and reliability, and the lack of sufficient supporting data further weakens its validity.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 introduces the idea that modifiers with fused nitrogen heterocyclic aromatic systems yield high, exemplified by tryptophan. While the rule offers physical-chemical insight into electron delocalization and metal coordination, it is supported by only one data point. The limited coverage necessitates more data to confirm the rule's applicability and strengthen its predictive power.

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids with Carboxylic Groups Yield High; Long-Chain Amino Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids (with 4 or 5 carbons) containing amino groups at the α-position and carboxylic acid groups yield high. These structures allow optimal coordination with the metal catalyst and minimize steric hindrance. In contrast, long-chain amino acids with terminal amino groups yield low, possibly due to ineffective coordination and increased steric hindrance.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: **Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Para Substituents Yield High; Electron-Donating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) yield high. These substituents enhance metal coordination by increasing the electrophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen. Electron-donating groups at the para position (e.g., methyl, methoxy) yield low, as they decrease the effectiveness of coordination with the metal center.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 3**: **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in high yield. The lone pair on the heterocyclic nitrogen can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity. If the nitrogen heterocycle is not directly attached to the carboxyl group, the yield is generally low due to reduced coordination efficiency.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 4**: **Aliphatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains yield high due to the thiol's ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - Octanoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid

---

    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms in aliphatic chains yield low. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and decrease solubility in the reaction medium.

  *Example:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Aliphatic Acids with Medium-Length Chains Yield High; Short Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups connected to carboxylic acids via medium-length aliphatic chains (e.g., five carbons) yield high.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Bulky Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky substituents that cannot effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst cause steric hindrance, leading to low yield. These groups may prevent proper access of the catalyst to the reactive sites of the modifier.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups Lacking Additional Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings yield low if they lack other coordinating functionalities. Methoxy groups are electron-donating and may reduce the electrophilicity needed for effective metal coordination.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 4-methoxybenzoic acid (if present)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Ketone Groups Adjacent to Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  Modifiers where an aldehyde or ketone group is directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or deactivate the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Dimethoxyphenyl Groups Attached via Medium-Length Chains Yield High**

  Modifiers containing dimethoxyphenyl groups connected by medium-length aliphatic chains (e.g., four carbons) yield high. The combination of electron-donating methoxy groups and optimal chain length may facilitate effective interaction with the catalyst.

  *Example:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear, specifying that modifiers with carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen heterocycles yield high, while those without direct attachment yield low. It provides physical-chemical insight into the coordination role of heterocyclic nitrogen lone pairs. The rule's complexity arises from considering the direct attachment to heterocycles. Supported by data points like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid yielding high, and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yielding low, it has good coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly differentiates between aliphatic thiol carboxylic acids yielding high and aromatic thiol carboxylic acids yielding low. It offers physical-chemical insight into how thiol groups coordinate differently in aliphatic versus aromatic contexts. The rule adds complexity by considering both the thiol group and the nature of the carbon chain (aliphatic vs. aromatic). With data points like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid yielding high and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid yielding low, it meets the minimal coverage requirement.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in stating that unsubstituted medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids yield high, whereas introducing terminal polar groups decreases yield. It provides physical-chemical insight by explaining the impact of polar groups on solubility and catalyst binding. The rule considers chain length and functional groups, adding complexity. Supported by octanoic acid yielding high and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid yielding low, it demonstrates strong coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 specifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains yield high. It offers physical-chemical insight into enhanced solubility and multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions stabilizing the catalyst complex. The rule adds complexity by considering both the number of hydroxyl groups and chain length. However, it is supported by only one clear data point—(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid—so its coverage is limited.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly states that modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yield low. It provides physical-chemical insight into how these carbonyl groups may compete for coordination or cause side reactions. The rule considers specific structural combinations, adding complexity. With multiple supporting data points—4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 4-oxoheptanedioic acid yielding low—it has strong coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 indicates that modifiers with polyether chains yield low due to steric hindrance and altered solvation dynamics. While the rule is clear and offers physical-chemical insight, it is supported by only one data point—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid—limiting its coverage and strength.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 states that modifiers with perfluorinated chains yield low because of reduced interactions with the catalyst and decreased solubility. The rule is clear and provides physical-chemical insight. However, it is supported by only one data point—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid—resulting in limited coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear in explaining that hydroxyphenylalkanoic acids with medium-length chains yield high, while shorter chains yield low due to insufficient flexibility for effective catalyst interaction. It provides physical-chemical insight into chain length effects and considers combinations of substructures. Supported by 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yielding high and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yielding low, it meets minimal coverage requirements.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 specifies that modifiers with fused aromatic systems containing heteroatoms yield high, attributing this to enhanced π-electron interactions and metal coordination. While the rule adds complexity by considering intricate ring systems, it is supported by only two data points—1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid—thus limiting its coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 addresses that bulky non-coordinating substituents lead to low yield due to steric hindrance obstructing catalyst access. It provides physical-chemical insight into steric effects but could improve in clarity, as "bulky" and "non-coordinating" are somewhat subjective terms. Supported by 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid and 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid yielding low, it meets minimal coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 asserts that modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups yield low. However, this rule lacks clarity as the example provided—2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid—does not contain methoxy groups, and there are data points like 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid yielding high, which contradict the rule. The rule lacks sufficient data support and clarity.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14, stating that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings yield low, is clear and provides physical-chemical insight. However, it is redundant with Rule 7, which covers modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yielding low. Combining these rules would improve conciseness and avoid redundancy.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is highly specific, focusing on modifiers with dimethoxyphenyl groups connected via ketone-containing chains yielding high. It provides physical-chemical insight into favorable interactions due to methoxy and ketone functionalities. However, it is supported by only one data point—4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid—limiting its coverage.

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers influence the reaction yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization. By considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, steric hindrance, and solubility, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield.

**Summary of Key Insights:**

- **Coordination Enhancement:** Functional groups such as amino, carboxylate, nitrogen heterocycles, thiol, and hydroxyl groups enhance coordination with the metal catalyst, leading to higher yields.
- **Functional Group Positioning:** The position of functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acid directly attached to a nitrogen heterocycle) significantly impacts coordination effectiveness.
- **Electronic Effects:** Substituents capable of coordinating with the catalyst enhance yield, regardless of whether they are electron-donating or electron-withdrawing.
- **Steric Considerations:** Bulky or flexible substituents, such as polyether chains or additional acetamido groups, can hinder effective catalyst coordination, resulting in lower yields.
- **Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic Balance:** Modifiers with appropriate chain lengths and functional group positioning balance hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, optimizing catalyst binding.
- **Structural Features:** Modifiers with medium-length aliphatic chains linking polar groups or containing rigid fused aromatic systems with heteroatoms offer unique coordination properties that enhance reaction outcomes.
- **Interfering Functional Groups:** Aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids or perfluorinated chains can interfere with catalyst coordination, leading to lower yields.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of potential modifiers and design new compounds to optimize and control the reaction yield.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** reiterates aspects of Rule 3, focusing on nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids yielding high. The **clarity** and **property insight** remain strong, but redundancy indicates that combining this rule with Rule 3 might enhance conciseness.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** is **clear** in stating that modifiers with oxygen-containing fused aromatic rings yield high. The **property insight** about additional coordination sites is valid. However, **coverage** is limited to a single data point (index 17), reducing the rule's robustness. More data points would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is **clear**, indicating that α-amino monocarboxylic acids with hydrophobic side chains yield low, except for indole rings. The **property insight** about steric hindrance and exceptional coordination ability of indole rings is logical. The **complexity** involves both the amino acid backbone and side-chain variations. **Coverage** is adequate with examples like phenylalanine yielding low (index 13) and tryptophan yielding high (index 15). The rule balances complexity with supportive data.
