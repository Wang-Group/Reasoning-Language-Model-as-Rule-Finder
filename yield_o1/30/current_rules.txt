**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1: Modifiers That Are α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino acids containing two carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic acids) yield high. The presence of both an amino group and two carboxylate groups enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, improving its stability and activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine) *(Monocarboxylic acid with hydrophobic side chain)*

---

- **Rule 2: Modifiers with Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles Directly Attached to Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers where a carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycle yield high. Nitrogen atoms enhance coordination with the metal catalyst, increasing catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Niacin)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Pyridine ring not directly bonded to carboxyl group)*

---

- **Rule 3: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing or Coordinating Groups Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high when the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group or capable of coordinating with the metal catalyst (e.g., nitro, amino, bromomethyl groups). These groups enhance electronic interactions and coordination with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Methyl group does not improve coordination)*
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)*

---

- **Rule 4: Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Terminal Polar Groups Yield High; Terminal Polar Groups Decrease Yield**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids yield high when they have medium-length chains (typically 6–8 carbons) without additional terminal polar functional groups. Introduction of terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) decreases the yield due to altered solubility and coordination dynamics.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **Octanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5: Modifiers with Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers featuring thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains yield high due to strong coordination via sulfur atoms. When the thiol group is attached to an aromatic ring, the yield is low, possibly due to reduced availability of the sulfur atom for effective coordination.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6: Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups yield high. The hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and provide additional coordination sites with the metal catalyst, improving reactivity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Single hydroxyl group at terminal position)*

---

- **Rule 7: Modifiers with Functional Groups That Interfere with Coordination Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers possessing functional groups that may interfere with catalyst coordination (e.g., aldehydes adjacent to carboxylic acids, perfluorinated alkyl chains, long polyether chains, bulky acetamido groups) yield low due to steric hindrance or electronic effects that disrupt effective binding.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Aldehyde adjacent to carboxylic acid)*
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Perfluorinated chain)*
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Long polyether chain)*
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Bulky acetamido group)*

---

- **Rule 8: Modifiers That Are α-Amino Monocarboxylic Acids with Hydrophobic Side Chains Yield Low; Exception for Indole Rings**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino monocarboxylic acids with large hydrophobic side chains yield low due to steric hindrance and reduced solubility. An exception exists for side chains capable of additional coordination, such as indole rings, which yield high.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan) *(Indole ring enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 9: Modifiers with Aromatic Rings Connected via Medium-Length Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that have an aromatic ring connected to a carboxylic acid via a medium-length aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) yield high. This structure balances hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, enhancing binding with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Shorter chain length reduces favorable interactions)*

---

- **Rule 10: Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups on Fused Aromatic Rings Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers containing fused aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., keto groups) yield high. These groups enhance the electron-deficient nature of the aromatic system, improving coordination with the metal catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
