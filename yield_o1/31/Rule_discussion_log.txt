- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for an unambiguous prediction of high yield when a modifier is an α-amino acid with a carboxylic acid side chain, as supported by aspartic acid and glutamic acid. The rule provides property insight by linking the acidic side chain to increased yield, possibly due to enhanced coordination with Fe ions. The rule appropriately combines sub-structures (α-amino acid and acidic side chain), and is supported by at least two data points.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in defining that α-amino acids with hydrophobic or basic side chains lead to low yield, as evidenced by phenylalanine, N-acetyllysine, and aminoalkanoic acids. The rule provides property insight by suggesting that hydrophobic or basic side chains negatively affect the yield, possibly by interfering with catalyst interactions. It appropriately combines sub-structures and is supported by several data points.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and allows clear prediction based on substituents on benzoic acid derivatives. The property insight is that electron-withdrawing groups at the para position enhance yield, possibly through favorable electronic effects on the catalyst interaction, whereas electron-donating groups decrease yield. The rule appropriately considers combinations of sub-structures and is well-supported by multiple data points.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in distinguishing between simple aliphatic carboxylic acids and those with amino groups, resulting in high or low yield respectively. The property insight is that amino groups negatively affect the reaction, possibly by interfering with catalyst coordination, whereas unfunctionalized aliphatic acids promote yield. The rule combines the aliphatic chain with functional group presence, and is supported by at least three data points.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and allows for unambiguous predictions. The property insight is that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen can coordinate with Fe centers, enhancing the reaction. The rule combines the heteroaromatic ring and carboxyl group, and is well-supported by multiple data points.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in predicting high yield for modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain. The property insight is that these hydroxyl groups can enhance catalyst interactions or solubility. However, the rule is based on a single data point, which limits its coverage and reliability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly predicts low yield for modifiers with polyether chains containing multiple ether linkages. The property insight suggests these structures may hinder reaction, possibly due to steric effects or interference with catalyst coordination. The rule combines specific structural features and is supported by at least two data points.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear in predicting low yield for modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains. The property insight is that perfluorinated chains might interfere with catalyst interactions or decrease solubility. However, the rule is supported by only a single data point, which limits its coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and allows the prediction of low yield for derivatives with aldehyde or ketone groups attached directly to an aromatic ring. The property insight is that these carbonyl groups might interfere with catalyst interactions or act as competing coordinating sites. The rule is backed by at least two data points.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly differentiates between aliphatic thiol acids (high yield) and aromatic thiol acids (low yield). The property insight is that the position of the thiol group affects interaction with the catalyst, possibly favoring aliphatic thiols. The rule combines structural features and is supported by data.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear in specifying that chain length affects the yield when hydroxyphenyl groups are present. The property insight is that longer linkers may position the functional groups favorably for interaction with the catalyst or reduce steric hindrance. The rule combines multiple structural elements and is supported by data.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly distinguishes between aromatic amino acids with electron-rich heterocycles and those without, in terms of yield. The property insight suggests that heterocyclic rings may enhance interaction with the catalyst via π-stacking or coordination. The rule combines several structural features and is supported by data.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly states that amide derivatives of amino acids or carboxylic acids result in low yield, which is supported by the data. The property insight is that amide groups might interfere with the catalyst or reaction mechanism, possibly due to different coordination behavior. The rule appropriately combines structural features.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear in predicting the yield based on the length of the linker between the aromatic ring and carboxylic acid group. The property insight is that longer linkers may allow better interaction or less steric hindrance in the catalysis. The rule considers multiple structural features and is supported by data.

These rules have been developed to reflect the observed relationships between the molecular features of the modifiers and the reaction yield, based on the provided dataset and underlying chemical principles. By combining multiple functional groups and structural motifs, the rules offer predictive power for determining whether a given modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** in the reaction.

**Underlying Chemical Principles:**

- **Coordination Ability:** Functional groups that can coordinate with the catalyst's metal center (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol, nitrogen heterocycles) enhance the modifier's effectiveness, leading to higher yields. The presence of heteroatoms like nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur provides lone pairs that can interact with metal centers.

- **Steric Effects:** Longer aliphatic chains or bulky substituents may hinder effective coordination due to steric hindrance, resulting in lower yields. Modifiers with optimal chain lengths allow better accessibility to the catalyst.

- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-donating groups facilitate better coordination with the catalyst by increasing electron density, whereas strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., perfluorinated chains) decrease electron density, hindering interaction.

- **Functional Group Interference:** Certain functional groups like aldehydes or amides may react with the catalyst or block active sites, reducing the catalyst's efficiency and leading to lower yields.

- **Linker Length:** The distance between functional groups (e.g., an aromatic ring and a carboxyl group) affects the modifier's ability to interact with the catalyst. Longer linkers can reduce steric hindrance and improve binding.

By focusing on broad trends and specific functional group effects, these rules maintain a balance between coverage and specificity. They prioritize rules that cover a broader range of the dataset while acknowledging more complex, narrower cases. This approach aligns with the requirements to generate rules that are grounded in chemical reasoning and applicable to a broad range of similar compounds.

These 15 rules cover the majority of the dataset and provide clear guidance on predicting the reaction yield based on the structural features of the molecular modifiers. They can be utilized to design new modifiers with desired properties, ultimately aiding in the optimization and control of the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Note:** The rules have been refined and improved upon to ensure clarity, coverage, and adherence to the provided requirements. Redundant or less effective rules from the previous set have been consolidated or removed, and new rules have been added to better capture the nuances of the dataset and underlying chemical principles.

These rules are developed based on the observed relationships between the molecular features of the modifiers and the reaction yield, considering the underlying chemical principles:

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups like amino, hydroxyl, thiol, and nitrogen-containing heterocycles enhance coordination with the catalyst's metal center, leading to higher yields. Electron-donating groups increase electron density at coordination sites, favoring coordination.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups, such as fluorinated alkyl chains or formyl groups, decrease electron density at potential coordination sites, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst and resulting in lower yields.

- **Steric Effects and Linker Length**: The length and flexibility of linkers between functional groups influence effective coordination. Flexible aliphatic chains of optimal length (typically four or five carbons) reduce steric hindrance and improve interactions with the catalyst. Chains that are too long or too short may reduce effectiveness due to steric hindrance or insufficient reach.

- **Functional Group Interference**: Certain groups, such as amide linkages and ether linkages, may interfere with the catalyst's activity or coordination ability, leading to lower yields. Thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings may cause steric hindrance or alter electronic properties unfavorably.

- **Additional Coordination Sites**: Modifiers with multiple coordination sites, such as polyhydroxylated acids or heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms, can form stronger interactions with the catalyst, enhancing its activity and leading to higher yields.
