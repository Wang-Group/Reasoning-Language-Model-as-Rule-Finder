**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with acidic side chains**, specifically those containing an amino group (-NH₂) and two carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) (e.g., aspartic acid and glutamic acid), result in **high yield**.

  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with basic or hydrophobic side chains**, such as phenylalanine and N-acetylated amino acids, result in **low yield**.

  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (N-Acetyllysine)
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acid derivatives substituted at the para position with amino (-NH₂) or nitro (-NO₂) groups** result in **high yield**, whereas those substituted with aldehyde (-CHO), methyl (-CH₃), or sulfanyl (-SH) groups result in **low yield**.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of up to eight carbons** (e.g., octanoic acid) result in **high yield**. However, if the aliphatic chain contains additional amino groups (-NH₂), they result in **low yield**.

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** with the carboxyl group directly attached to a heterocyclic ring containing nitrogen atoms (e.g., pyridinecarboxylic acids, pyrazolecarboxylic acids) result in **high yield**.

  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains containing electron-rich heterocycles**, such as the indole ring in tryptophan, result in **high yield**, whereas those with non-heterocyclic aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) result in **low yield**.

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups attached to an aliphatic chain or cyclic backbone**, such as sugar acids, result in **high yield**.

  - *Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains with multiple ether linkages** (e.g., triethylene glycol derivatives) result in **low yield**.

  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers where a **thiol group (-SH) is attached to an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**, whereas thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in **low yield**.

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains**, such as perfluorinated carboxylic acids, result in **low yield**.

  - *Example*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (=O) groups directly attached to an aromatic ring** result in **low yield**.

  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a **hydroxyphenyl group connected via a sufficiently long aliphatic chain (five carbons or more) to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**, whereas those with shorter chains result in **low yield**.

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
