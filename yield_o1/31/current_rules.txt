**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids**, meaning they are **α-amino acids with an additional carboxyl group in the side chain**, result in **high yield**. The presence of both amino and extra carboxyl groups enhances chelation with the metal center.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of metal coordination**, such as **amino (-NH₂)**, **nitro (-NO₂)**, or **bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)**, result in **high yield**. These substituents provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Methyl group lacks coordination ability)*
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Formyl group reduces electron density)*

- **Rule 3**: **Heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring**, such as **pyridine** and **pyrazole** derivatives, result in **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms offer lone pairs for strong coordination with the metal center.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Possibility of steric hindrance due to biphenyl-like structure)*

- **Rule 4**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of eight carbons or fewer**, especially those with **coordinating groups** (e.g., amino or thiol groups) near the carboxyl end, result in **high yield**. Proximity of coordinating groups enhances metal binding.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(Amino group too distant from carboxyl group)*

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids**, containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, result in **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]-2-oxoacetic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that contain ether linkages (-O-) within their carbon chains** result in **low yield**. The flexibility and potential interference from ether oxygens reduce effective coordination with the metal center.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid**, such as **formyl (-CHO)** groups or **fluorinated alkyl chains**, result in **low yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density at coordination sites, hindering effective interaction with the metal center.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents or sterically hindering groups near potential coordination sites** result in **low yield**. Steric hindrance can prevent effective coordination with the metal center.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with flexible aliphatic linkers and coordinating substituents on the aromatic ring** result in **high yield**. The flexible linker reduces steric hindrance and allows better interaction with the metal center.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Shorter linker may limit flexibility and coordination)*

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains containing heteroatoms capable of chelation**, such as an **indole ring**, result in **high yield**. Additional coordination sites enhance interaction with the metal center.

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*

  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine lacks coordinating side chain)*
