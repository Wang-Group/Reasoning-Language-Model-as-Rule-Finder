**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing an amino group within three carbons of the carboxylate tend to result in high yield, especially when the amino group is in the alpha or beta position relative to the carboxylate.**

  - *Explanation*: Proximal amino groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through chelation.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position, such as amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups, tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups at the para position can enhance metal coordination by increasing the acidity of the carboxylate and facilitating interaction with metal centers.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing hydroxyl groups within two to three carbons of the carboxylate tend to result in high yield when these hydroxyl groups can coordinate with metals.**

  - *Explanation*: Hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing chelation and stabilizing the metal catalyst.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in positions that can coordinate with metals tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can act as ligands, coordinating with metal centers to enhance catalytic activity.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple carboxylic acid groups (diacids) tend to result in high yield due to the ability to chelate through multiple coordination sites.**

  - *Explanation*: Diacids can coordinate through both carboxylate groups, forming stable chelating complexes with metal centers.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxylate tend to result in high yield, whereas aromatic thiol groups may result in low yield due to possible catalyst poisoning.**

  - *Explanation*: Aliphatic thiols can coordinate with metal centers without excessively binding or deactivating them, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalysis.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl chains near the carboxylate tend to result in low yield due to decreased electron density for coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate effectively with metal centers.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers featuring bulky or flexible ether chains adjacent to the carboxylate tend to result in low yield due to steric hindrance impeding coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Bulky ether chains can prevent effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating functional groups tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Aromatic side chains without coordinating groups do not enhance metal coordination beyond the amino and carboxylate groups.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(Methionine derivative)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxylate tend to result in low yield due to possible side reactions or competing coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Carbonyl groups can interact with metal centers or participate in side reactions, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with intramolecular hydrogen bonding that sequesters coordinating groups tend to result in low yield due to decreased availability of these groups for metal coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Internal hydrogen bonds can reduce the ability of functional groups to coordinate with the metal, diminishing catalytic activity.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Acetylated lysine)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers combining multiple proximate coordinating groups, such as amino and hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate, tend to result in high yield due to synergistic chelation effects.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple adjacent coordinating groups enhance binding to the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to result in lower yield due to limited coordination ability.**

  - *Explanation*: Lack of functional groups beyond the carboxylate reduces the ability to form strong interactions with metal centers.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-donating groups at positions that do not enhance metal coordination tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups may increase electron density but may not improve coordination unless properly positioned.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles capable of coordination tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Side-chain nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*

**Summary and Key Considerations:**

These rules establish the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their effect on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. They emphasize the importance of functional groups capable of coordinating with metal centers, such as amino, hydroxyl, thiol, and heteroaromatic nitrogen atoms.

**Highlights:**

- **Proximal Coordinating Groups Enhance Yield**: Functional groups like amino and hydroxyl near the carboxylate increase metal coordination through chelation, leading to higher yields.

- **Aromatic Substituents' Influence**: Electron-withdrawing groups at strategic positions on aromatic rings can facilitate coordination, whereas electron-donating groups without proper positioning may not.

- **Chelation Through Multiple Sites**: Modifiers with multiple coordinating sites, such as diacids or compounds with several functional groups, form more stable complexes with metal centers.

- **Steric and Electronic Hindrance**: Bulky groups, flexible chains, or electron-withdrawing substituents can impede effective coordination, leading to lower yields.

**Applicability:**

These rules serve as guidelines for selecting molecular modifiers to optimize the yield of the reaction. By analyzing the presence and positioning of functional groups, chemists can predict the performance of modifiers and tailor them to enhance catalytic activity.
