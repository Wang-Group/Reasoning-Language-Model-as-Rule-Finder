The property insight is solid, explaining why aliphatic thiols enhance activity while aromatic thiols may inhibit it. The complexity is appropriate, and coverage is acceptable with supporting data for high yield (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) and low yield (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid).

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear, with strong property insight into how the direct attachment of carboxylic acid groups to pyridine rings enhances coordination with metal centers.

The complexity is high, considering multiple functional groups and their interactions. Coverage is limited to a single data point (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) yielding high results. Additional data would improve the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is moderately clear but introduces some inconsistencies. While it suggests that electron-donating groups capable of coordinating with metal ions on aromatic rings lead to high yield, data point 31 (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid) shows low yield despite fitting the structural criteria.

- **Comment 3**: While Rule 3 is based on the coordination abilities of nitrogen heterocycles, it lacks clarity due to conflicting data. Specifically, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid gives a low yield despite containing a coordinating nitrogen heterocycle. This suggests that additional structural factors influence the yield, and the rule may need refinement to account for these exceptions. The coverage is adequate but would benefit from addressing contradictions to improve clarity and balance.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and provides physico-chemical insight into how multiple hydroxyl groups can stabilize reactive intermediates through hydrogen bonding and coordination. However, it is based on a single data point, limiting its coverage. To strengthen this rule, more supporting data points are needed to verify its general applicability and improve balance.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and distinguishes modifiers based on chain length and the presence of terminal polar groups. The rationale is sound, considering how hydrophobic interactions and the absence of steric hindrance enhance catalyst performance. It involves combinations of structural features and is supported by multiple data points for both high and low yields, ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 effectively differentiates between aliphatic and aromatic thiols in terms of their impact on yield. The rule is clear, and the rationale about coordination with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst is plausible. However, the coverage is minimal, with only one data point for each case. Additional data would enhance the rule's validity and balance.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and supported by two data points, providing adequate coverage. The physico-chemical insight into how aldehyde groups can deactivate the catalyst through side reactions or forming inactive complexes is reasonable. The rule is simple and well-balanced, but further data could strengthen its applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly states that modifiers with internal amide bonds (excluding simple amino acids) give low yield. The rationale that amide groups may compete with the catalyst for metal binding or block active sites is solid. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by at least two data points, ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in identifying that strongly electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains lead to low yield. The physico-chemical rationale is adequate. However, the rule is based on a single data point, which limits its coverage and balance. Additional examples are needed to confirm the rule's general validity.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and has adequate physico-chemical insight into how polyether chains can interfere with the catalyst's coordination environment. It considers combinations of structural features and is supported by at least two data points, providing acceptable coverage and balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is complex due to the exception involving extended conjugated systems, which affects clarity. While the rationale is valid, the coverage is minimal, with only one data point supporting each case. The rule would benefit from simplification and additional supporting data to improve its clarity, coverage, and balance.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear and provides reasonable physico-chemical insight into how large aromatic systems can enhance catalyst performance through π-π interactions. However, it lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one data point. More examples are necessary to validate the rule and ensure proper balance.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 has conflicting data, as 5-aminopentanoic acid gives a high yield while 8-aminooctanoic acid gives a low yield. This inconsistency impacts the rule's clarity and suggests that factors such as chain length or steric effects may influence the outcome. The rule requires refinement and additional data to resolve contradictions, enhancing clarity and balance.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear with adequate physico-chemical insight regarding the formation of strong chelates that may deactivate the catalyst. However, it is based on a single data point, limiting its coverage. Additional examples are necessary to confirm the rule's applicability and improve balance.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 distinguishes between the positioning of phenolic hydroxyl groups relative to the carboxylic acid. While the rule is supported by data and provides a plausible rationale, the clarity could be improved by explicitly explaining the significance of the aliphatic chain length. Coverage is acceptable but would benefit from more data points to enhance balance.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:
  - **Rule 1** demonstrates excellent clarity by clearly specifying that α-amino acids containing side-chain carboxylic acid groups give high yield. The property insight is strong, explaining how additional carboxyl groups enhance metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance. The rule effectively combines sub-structures (α-amino acid backbone with side-chain carboxylic acids), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by data points such as (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid, fulfilling the coverage requirement. Overall, the rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 2**:
  - **Rule 2** lacks clarity due to inconsistencies between the rule and the examples provided. The rule states that para-substituted electron-donating groups lead to high yield, while electron-withdrawing groups lead to low yield. However, 4-nitrobenzoic acid (an electron-withdrawing group) is listed as a high-yield example, and 4-methylbenzoic acid (an electron-donating group) is listed as low yield. This contradiction undermines the clarity and property insight of the rule. While the rule attempts to combine sub-structures and has coverage, the inconsistency diminishes its effectiveness and balance.

- **Comment 3**:
  - **Rule 3** excels in clarity by specifying that modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxyl groups give high yield. The property insight is solid, attributing enhanced catalyst performance to additional coordination sites provided by nitrogen atoms. The rule combines nitrogen heterocycles with carboxyl groups, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, satisfying coverage. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**:
  - **Rule 4** suffers from a lack of clarity due to contradictions in the examples. It states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains without polar groups give high yield, yet includes 5-aminopentanoic acid (which has a polar amino group) as a high-yield example. Additionally, the rule mentions that additional polar groups lead to low yield, but 5-aminopentanoic acid contradicts this. This inconsistency affects the property insight and balance of the rule.

    - **High yield example**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
    - **Low yield example**: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
    - **Rationale**: Aliphatic thiols are more accessible for metal coordination, whereas aromatic thiols may be less reactive due to resonance stabilization and steric factors.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with heterocyclic aromatic side chains containing nitrogen atoms** give **high yield**.
    - **Example**: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).
    - **Rationale**: Heterocyclic nitrogen atoms enhance coordination with the metal center, improving catalyst stability and reactivity.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **hydroxylated aliphatic chains (multiple hydroxyl groups)** give **high yield**.
    - **Example**: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid).
    - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and facilitate hydrogen bonding, enhancing interaction with the metal center.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **aromatic rings separated from the carboxylic acid group by an aliphatic chain of three or more carbons** give **high yield**.
    - **Example**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.
    - **Rationale**: Increased distance between the aromatic ring and carboxyl group reduces steric hindrance at the metal center, allowing better coordination.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds within aliphatic chains** give **low yield**.
    - **Examples**: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid.
    - **Rationale**: Internal amide groups can decrease molecular flexibility and interfere with effective metal coordination, negatively affecting catalyst performance.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and well-defined, specifying that α-amino dicarboxylic acids give high yield. The rule provides solid physical-chemical insight by highlighting multiple coordination sites enhancing catalyst activity. It considers combinations of functional groups (amino and two carboxyl groups) and is supported by at least two data points—(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid—meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 lacks clarity due to inconsistencies with the dataset. While it states that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups give high yield, one of its examples, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, actually gives low yield according to the dataset. This contradiction undermines the rule's reliability. The property insight is acceptable, but the inconsistency suggests a need for reevaluation or refinement of the rule.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight by emphasizing nitrogen atoms in heterocycles enhancing metal coordination. It considers the combination of nitrogen-containing heterocycles and carboxylic acid groups, adding complexity. Supported by at least two data points—pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid—it satisfies the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear, indicating that short aliphatic chains with polar functional groups give high yield. The rationale is sound, linking strong metal coordination to enhanced performance. It combines structural features (chain length and polar groups), adding complexity. With examples like 5-aminopentanoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, it is supported by sufficient data points.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and provides physical-chemical insight by associating multiple hydroxyl groups with catalyst stabilization. However, its coverage is limited to a single data point—(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid—reducing its robustness and general applicability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 conflicts with the dataset. Although it claims that modifiers with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups give low yield, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, listed as an example, actually gives high yield in the dataset. This discrepancy indicates that the rule lacks clarity and reliability, and the physical-chemical rationale does not align with the observed data.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is contradicted by the dataset; it states that modifiers with long aliphatic chains give low yield, but octanoic acid, one of the examples, gives high yield according to the data. This inconsistency suggests that chain length alone may not be a determining factor and that the rule may require refinement to account for additional structural features or exceptions.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and offers good physical-chemical insight into how polyether chains affect catalyst performance. It considers combinations of structural features, adding complexity. With at least two supporting data points—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid—it satisfies the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and provides reasonable physical-chemical insight regarding steric hindrance from bulky aromatic side chains. However, its coverage is limited to a single data point—(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid—reducing its overall strength and predictive power.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is well-defined and offers solid physical-chemical reasoning about how amide bonds adjacent to aromatic rings can reduce catalytic performance. It adds complexity by considering specific structural arrangements. Supported by at least two data points—2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid and (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid—it meets the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and provides acceptable physical-chemical insight into the effects of fluorination on electron density and metal-ligand interactions. However, it has limited coverage with only one supporting data point—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid—which may limit its general applicability.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 offers clarity and insight into why thiol groups on aromatic rings might lead to low yield. Despite this, it lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one data point—4-sulfanylbenzoic acid—which diminishes its reliability.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is inconsistent with the dataset. It asserts that modifiers with ortho-substituted hydroxy or amino groups give high yield, yet the example provided, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, gives low yield according to the data. This inconsistency questions the rule's validity and suggests a need for reevaluation.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear and provides reasonable physical-chemical insight into how internal amide bonds may hinder coordination. However, it is supported by only one data point—2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid—reducing its coverage and predictive strength.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and offers solid physical-chemical insight by combining multiple structural features—aromatic rings with short aliphatic linkers. It is supported by at least two data points—5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid—meeting the coverage requirement and making it a strong rule.
