**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino dicarboxylic acids** (amino acids with two carboxyl groups) give **high yield**.
   - **Examples**: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid).
   - **Rationale**: The presence of both amino and two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites to the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups** (e.g., amino, hydroxy) give **high yield**.
   - **Examples**: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, strengthening metal-ligand interactions and improving catalytic efficiency.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids** give **high yield**.
   - **Examples**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.
   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to the metal center and promoting catalytic activity.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers with **short aliphatic chains (≤5 carbons) bearing polar functional groups** (e.g., amino, thiol) give **high yield**.
   - **Examples**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
   - **Rationale**: Short chains with polar groups facilitate strong metal coordination without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalyst performance.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids** (sugar acids) give **high yield**.
   - **Example**: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid).
   - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and can form hydrogen bonds, stabilizing the metal complex.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro, formyl) give **low yield**.
   - **Examples**: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid.
   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on the aromatic ring, weakening metal-ligand interactions and decreasing catalytic effectiveness.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains (≥6 carbons) regardless of functional groups** give **low yield**.
   - **Examples**: Octanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
   - **Rationale**: Long aliphatic chains increase steric bulk and molecular flexibility, hindering effective metal coordination.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains** (multiple ether linkages in aliphatic chains) give **low yield**.
   - **Examples**: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.
   - **Rationale**: Polyether chains increase flexibility and solvation, disrupting stable metal-ligand interactions essential for catalytic activity.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **bulky nonpolar aromatic side chains** (e.g., phenyl groups) give **low yield**.
   - **Example**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine).
   - **Rationale**: Bulky aromatic groups cause steric hindrance near the metal center, impeding effective coordination and reducing catalyst efficiency.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds adjacent to aromatic rings** give **low yield**.
    - **Examples**: 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.
    - **Rationale**: Amide groups adjacent to aromatic rings can engage in resonance, reducing availability of lone pairs for metal coordination and decreasing catalytic performance.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups** give **low yield**.
    - **Example**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.
    - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **thiol groups on aromatic rings** give **low yield**.
    - **Example**: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
    - **Rationale**: Thiol groups on aromatic systems are less effective in metal coordination due to potential delocalization of electrons and steric hindrance.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituted hydroxy or amino groups** give **high yield**.
    - **Example**: 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
    - **Rationale**: Ortho-substituents can participate in chelation with the metal center, forming stable five-membered chelate rings that enhance catalyst activity.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **amide bonds within aliphatic chains** give **low yield**.
    - **Example**: 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid.
    - **Rationale**: Internal amide groups reduce chain flexibility and may obstruct effective coordination with the metal center.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **aromatic rings separated from carboxylic acid groups by short aliphatic chains (2–4 carbons)** give **high yield**.
    - **Examples**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.
    - **Rationale**: The aliphatic linker reduces steric hindrance at the coordination site while the aromatic ring can engage in favorable π-interactions, enhancing catalyst performance.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been formulated based on an in-depth analysis of the provided dataset and fundamental chemical principles influencing metal-ligand coordination in the catalytic reaction. Each rule:

- **Combines Functional Groups**: By considering combinations of structural features such as functional groups, chain length, and substitution patterns, the rules link specific molecular characteristics to the observed yields.
- **Considers Physical-Chemical Properties**: The rationales account for factors like electron donation/withdrawal, steric effects, chelation ability, and molecular flexibility—all crucial in determining metal coordination and catalyst efficiency.
- **Provides Clear Predictions**: Each rule explicitly states whether a modifier fitting the description is expected to yield a high or low value, facilitating the prediction of catalytic outcomes for new compounds.
- **Covers a Broad Dataset Range**: The rules address a wide variety of modifiers in the dataset, including amino acids, aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids, and molecules with diverse functional groups.
- **Balances Simplicity and Complexity**: The rules strike a balance between broad applicability (e.g., modifiers with long aliphatic chains give low yield) and specific scenarios (e.g., modifiers with ortho-substituted hydroxy groups on aromatic rings give high yield), aligning with the requirement to blend simple and complex rules.

**Note**: These refined rules supersede the previous set, addressing overlaps and eliminating less effective or redundant rules to improve clarity and predictive power. They serve as a practical guide for selecting or designing molecular modifiers to optimize the yield of the radical-mediated δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. Experimental validation is recommended to confirm their applicability to modifiers beyond the dataset.---------------------------------------------------------------
