**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids containing side chains with additional carboxylate groups result in a **high** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid) (High yield)
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid) (High yield)
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Explanation*: Additional carboxylate groups enhance coordination with the metal catalyst (Fe), improving its activity by providing multiple binding sites.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in a **low** yield; however, if the aromatic side chain contains coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen), the yield is **high**.**

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine) (Low yield)

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan) (High yield)

  *Explanation*: Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms do not facilitate effective metal coordination. Heteroatoms like nitrogen can bond with the metal center, enhancing stability and reactivity.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles result in a **high** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (High yield)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (High yield)
  - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (High yield)
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings serve as coordination sites for the metal catalyst, enhancing its reactivity by facilitating electron transfer.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, aldehyde) result in a **high** yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) result in a **low** yield.**

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (High yield)

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (High yield due to extended conjugation)

  *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing metal coordination. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity, diminishing coordination efficiency.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups capable of coordination result in a **high** yield, despite the amino group being electron-donating.**

  *Example*:
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (High yield)

  *Explanation*: The amino group provides an additional site for metal coordination, compensating for its electron-donating effect and enhancing catalyst interaction.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (6 carbons or more) and no additional polar functional groups result in a **high** yield.**

  *Example*:
  - *Octanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Explanation*: Hydrophobic chains can interact favorably with the catalyst's environment, aiding in substrate accessibility without hindering metal coordination.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (6 carbons or more) and additional polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) result in a **low** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Polar groups on long chains introduce steric hindrance and unfavorable polar interactions, disrupting effective coordination with the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups result in a **high** yield due to increased coordination sites.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid) (High yield)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (High yield)

  *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional sites for hydrogen bonding and metal coordination, enhancing catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with thiol groups attached to short aliphatic chains result in a **high** yield; thiol groups on aromatic rings result in a **low** yield.**

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with metal centers due to their high nucleophilicity. Aromatic thiols are less nucleophilic and may engage in less effective metal binding.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups result in a **low** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups can form irreversible complexes with the metal catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst availability.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that contain perfluorinated alkyl chains result in a **low** yield due to decreased coordinating ability.**

  *Example*:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with extended aliphatic chains (3 carbons or more) result in a **high** yield; shorter chains may not mitigate steric effects, leading to a **low** yield.**

  *High Yield Examples*:
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (High yield)
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and reduce steric hindrance near the coordination site, improving metal interaction.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages in the chain result in a **low** yield.**

  *Example*:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and polarity, potentially disrupting optimal binding and increasing steric hindrance around the metal center.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with adjacent carbonyl groups (e.g., ketones, amides) near the carboxylate result in a **low** yield due to possible over-chelation and catalyst deactivation.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Low yield)
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (Despite being high yield, may be an exception)

  *Explanation*: Additional carbonyl groups can form strong chelates with the metal, reducing catalyst turnover and activity.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with long aliphatic side chains or bulky substituents result in a **low** yield due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Bulky or long side chains can interfere with the metal catalyst's active sites, hindering effective complex formation.
