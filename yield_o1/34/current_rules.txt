**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids** with side chains containing **additional acidic groups** (e.g., carboxyl or hydroxyl groups) result in a **high yield**; those with **non-polar or bulky side chains** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - *5-Aminopentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Lysine derivative)
    - *8-Aminooctanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Additional acidic groups (like carboxyl or hydroxyl) in the side chain increase the molecule's ability to coordinate with Fe ions through additional binding sites and hydrogen bonding. This enhances the formation and activity of the Fe-based catalyst. Non-polar or bulky side chains lack these coordination sites and may introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst formation and activity.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing substituents** (e.g., nitro, halogens) in the **para position** result in a **high yield**; those with **electron-donating substituents** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Methylbenzoic acid*
    - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate ion, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, diminishing coordination ability. The para position maximizes this effect due to resonance.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that contain **nitrogen-containing heterocycles** (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) attached directly or via short linkers to the **carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**; those with **bulky aromatic linkers** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing catalyst formation. Short linkers ensure effective metal-ligand interactions. Bulky aromatic linkers introduce steric hindrance, impeding coordination.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**; those with **insufficient hydroxyl groups** or **hydroxyl groups far from the carboxylate** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate enhance Fe ion coordination through chelation and hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxylate or in insufficient numbers cannot effectively participate in metal coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **accessible thiol groups** result in a **high yield**; those with **thiol groups in aromatic systems** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Thiol groups are strong ligands for Fe ions due to their soft Lewis base character. In aliphatic chains, thiol groups are more accessible for coordination. In aromatic systems, thiol groups are less available due to resonance stabilization with the aromatic ring, reducing their ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde or acyl substituents** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Aldehyde and acyl groups can interfere with Fe ion coordination by either participating in side reactions (e.g., forming Schiff bases with amines) or by withdrawing electron density from the carboxylate group, weakening its coordinating ability.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are **perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in a **low yield** due to reduced electron density on the carboxylate group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the electron density of the carboxylate, weakening its coordination to Fe ions. This results in less effective catalyst formation.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **amino groups on short chains** (up to 5 carbons) result in a **high yield**; those with **amino groups on longer chains** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-Aminopentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-Aminooctanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Amino groups on short chains can effectively coordinate with Fe ions by forming stable chelates. On longer chains, the amino group is spatially distant from the carboxylate, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination (chelation) and potentially introducing steric hindrance.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are **ethers with multiple hydroxyl groups** near the **carboxylate** result in a **high yield**; ethers lacking sufficient hydroxyl groups result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination with Fe ions through hydrogen bonding and chelation. Ethers without enough hydroxyl groups cannot provide these interactions, resulting in weaker metal coordination and lower catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents directly attached to the ring** result in a **low yield**; increasing the distance between bulky groups and the carboxylate leads to a **high yield**.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
    - *2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group cause steric hindrance, impeding effective coordination with Fe ions. A longer aliphatic linker distances the bulky group from the carboxylate, reducing steric effects and allowing better metal-ligand interactions.

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. They consider underlying physicochemical properties such as metal coordination ability, steric effects, electronic effects, and chelation potential.

**Application of the Rules:**

     - *Examples:* Gluconic acid.
   - **Aliphatic Thiolacids (Rule 5):** Utilize aliphatic carboxylic acids with accessible thiol groups.
     - *Example:* 3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid.
   - **Short-Chain Amino Acids (Rule 8):** Consider aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups on short chains for effective chelation.
     - *Example:* 5-Aminopentanoic acid.
   - **Ethers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups (Rule 9):** Include modifiers where ethers have sufficient hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate.
     - *Example:* 2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.
   - **Aromatic Acids with Distant Bulky Groups (Rule 10):** Choose modifiers where bulky substituents are separated from the carboxylate by an aliphatic linker.
     - *Example:* 5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

2. **Identifying Low Yield Modifiers:**
   - **Amino Acids with Non-Polar/Bulky Side Chains (Rule 1):** Avoid amino acids with side chains that lack coordination sites or introduce steric hindrance.
     - *Examples:* Phenylalanine, 8-Aminooctanoic acid.
   - **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups (Rule 2):** Refrain from using modifiers with methyl, methoxy, or other electron-donating substituents at the para position.
     - *Examples:* 4-Methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.
   - **Modifiers with Bulky Aromatic Linkers (Rule 3):** Avoid modifiers where heterocycles are attached via bulky aromatic rings.
     - *Example:* 4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.
   - **Modifiers Lacking Sufficient Hydroxyl Groups (Rule 4 & 9):** Exclude aliphatic acids or ethers that do not have enough hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate.
     - *Examples:* 7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid, 2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.
   - **Aromatic Thiol Acids (Rule 5):** Do not use thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids.
     - *Example:* 4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid.
   - **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Acyl Substituents (Rule 6):** Steer clear of modifiers with aldehyde or acyl groups.
     - *Examples:* 4-Formylbenzoic acid, 4-Oxoheptanedioic acid.
   - **Perfluorinated Acids (Rule 7):** Exclude modifiers that are perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids.
     - *Example:* 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid.
   - **Long-Chain Amino Acids (Rule 8):** Avoid amino acids with amino groups on long aliphatic chains.
     - *Examples:* 7-Aminoheptanoic acid, 8-Aminooctanoic acid.
   - **Modifiers with Sterically Hindered Carboxylate Groups (Rule 10):** Do not use modifiers where bulky groups are adjacent to the carboxylate.
     - *Examples:* 4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

**Underlying Physicochemical Principles:**

- **Coordination Ability:** Modifiers that can effectively coordinate with Fe ions through multiple binding sites (e.g., carboxylate, hydroxyl, amino, thiol, nitrogen heterocycles) enhance catalyst formation and activity.
- **Steric Effects:** Bulky groups near coordination sites impede effective metal-ligand interactions due to steric hindrance.
- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylate anion, while electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.
- **Chelation Potential:** Modifiers capable of chelating Fe ions through multiple neighboring donor atoms form more stable complexes, improving catalyst performance.
- **Side Reactions:** Functional groups like aldehydes may participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of the modifier to coordinate with Fe ions.

**Note on Rule Application:**

When evaluating a new modifier:

- **Consider All Applicable Rules:** A compound may fall under multiple rules; assess each rule's impact based on the modifier's structure.
- **Balance Between Features:** Some features may enhance yield, while others may diminish it. Prioritize modifiers where the enhancing features dominate.
- **Physicochemical Context:** Think about how the modifier's functional groups interact during catalyst formation and the reaction process.

**Summary:**

These rules provide a comprehensive framework for predicting the efficacy of molecular modifiers in enhancing the yield of the target reaction. By focusing on the presence and combination of specific functional groups and structural features, grounded in coordination chemistry and steric considerations, researchers can make informed decisions when selecting or designing new modifiers. This approach facilitates the optimization and control of the reaction yield, advancing the goals of the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------
