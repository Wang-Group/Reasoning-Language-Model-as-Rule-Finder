    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with no additional functional groups yield a high value of yield when the carbon chain length is up to 8 carbons.**

  *Examples*:  
  - *Octanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexamples*:  
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Low yield; hydroxyl group reduces yield)  
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Low yield; amino group decreases yield)

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with short aliphatic chains (3 to 5 carbons) yield a high value of yield.**

  *Examples*:  
  - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid, High yield)
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid, High yield)
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexamples*:  
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield; longer chain length)
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Low yield; additional acetamido group)

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position yield a high value of yield.**

  *Examples*:  
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (High yield)
  - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexamples*:  
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Low yield; methyl is electron-donating)
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Low yield; aldehyde group may interfere with catalyst)

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heterocycle yield a high value of yield.**

  *Examples*:  
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (High yield)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (High yield)
  - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexample*:  
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Low yield; steric hindrance due to additional ring)

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids yield a high value of yield due to enhanced coordination with the catalyst.**

  *Examples*:  
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid, High yield)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexample*:  
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Low yield; single hydroxyl group insufficient)

  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexample*:  
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) at the para position yield a low value of yield.**

  *Examples*:  
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Exception*:  
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (High yield; amino group can coordinate with catalyst)

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains yield a low value of yield due to destabilization of the catalyst complex.**

  *Example*:  
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (Low yield)

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings yield a low value of yield due to potential side reactions.**

  *Examples*:  
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Example*:  
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (Low yield)

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to carboxylic acid groups yield a low value of yield due to reduced coordination ability.**

  *Examples*:  
  - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (Low yield)
  - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Low yield)

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yield a low value of yield unless compensated by electron-donating groups.**

  *Example*:  
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Low yield)

  *Exception*:  
  - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (High yield; methoxy groups enhance yield)

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are fused-ring carboxylic acids or contain lactone structures yield a high value of yield due to rigid structures facilitating coordination.**

  *Example*:  
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (High yield)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with amino groups on long aliphatic chains (more than 6 carbons) yield a low value of yield due to steric hindrance.**

  *Examples*:  
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield)

**End of Rules**

These rules capture the relationship between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the reaction yield. They consider the following underlying physical-chemical properties:

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and coordination ability, enhancing yield. Electron-donating groups decrease these properties, lowering yield.
- **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents and long chains introduce steric hindrance, affecting the modifier's ability to interact with the catalyst.
- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups capable of coordinating with the metal center (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups) influence yield based on their position and the overall structure.
- **Chelation and Rigid Structures**: Modifiers that can chelate or have rigid structures facilitate better interaction with the catalyst, improving yield.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low reaction yield based on its structural features.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of up to 8 carbons and without additional functional groups yield a high value of yield due to optimal hydrophobic interaction and minimal steric hindrance.**

  *Example*:
  - *Octanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexamples*:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Low yield; additional hydroxyl group increases polarity and affects coordination)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield; amino group may interfere with catalyst interaction)

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with short aliphatic side chains yield a high value of yield due to favorable coordination with the catalyst's metal centers; aromatic or bulky side chains decrease the yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid, High yield)
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexamples*:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine, Low yield; aromatic side chain interferes with coordination)
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Low yield; longer chain and additional amide group reduce coordination)

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position yield a high value of yield due to increased acidity and better coordination with the catalyst.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (High yield)
  - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexamples*:
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Low yield; methyl group is electron-donating)
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Low yield; aldehyde group may interfere with catalyst coordination)

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heterocycle yield a high value of yield due to strong coordination between heteroatoms and the metal catalyst.**

  *Examples*:
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid, High yield)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexample*:
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Low yield; additional benzene ring causes steric hindrance)

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxylated acids) yield a high value of yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and stabilization of the catalyst complex.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid, High yield)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexample*:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Low yield; single hydroxyl group insufficient for stabilization)

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol groups (-SH) on short aliphatic chains yield a high value of yield due to strong coordination between sulfur atoms and the metal catalyst.**

  *Example*:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexample*:
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Low yield; thiol on aromatic ring reduces effective coordination)

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) at the para position yield a low value of yield due to decreased acidity and weaker coordination with the catalyst.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Exception*:
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (High yield; amino group can coordinate positively with the catalyst)

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains yield a low value of yield due to the strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms disrupting catalyst functionality.**

  *Example*:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (Low yield)

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or formyl groups attached to aromatic rings yield a low value of yield due to potential side reactions with the catalyst or inhibition of coordination sites.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (Low yield)

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with indole side chains yield a high value of yield due to favorable π–π interactions and coordination with the catalyst, whereas phenyl side chains yield a low value of yield.**

  *Example*:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan, High yield)

  *Counterexample*:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine, Low yield)

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in their aliphatic chain yield a low value of yield due to increased flexibility and decreased ability to form stable complexes with the catalyst.**

  *Example*:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (Low yield)

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with additional amide bonds adjacent to carboxylic acid groups yield a low value of yield due to reduced availability of coordination sites and potential catalyst deactivation.**

  *Example*:
  - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Low yield)

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (more than 6 carbons) bearing polar functional groups yield a low value of yield due to steric hindrance and decreased effective coordination with the catalyst.**

  *Examples*:
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield)

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic acids with fused ring systems or lactone structures yield a high value of yield due to rigid structures facilitating effective coordination with the catalyst.**

  *Example*:
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (High yield)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acid yield varying results; if compensated by electron-donating groups elsewhere, the yield may be high; otherwise, the yield is low due to interference with catalyst coordination.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Low yield)
  - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (High yield; methoxy groups enhance electron density)

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate the direct relationship between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the reaction yield, considering the following underlying physical-chemical properties:

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance the modifier's ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst, leading to higher yields. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken coordination, resulting in lower yields.

- **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents and long aliphatic chains introduce steric hindrance, impeding effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, leading to lower yields.

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups capable of strong coordination with the metal center (e.g., amino, thiol groups) influence the yield based on their position and the overall structure of the modifier. Proper positioning enhances coordination and increases yield, while improper positioning or additional interfering groups can negate the positive effects.

- **Hydrogen Bonding and Chelation**: Modifiers capable of forming hydrogen bonds or chelating the metal center stabilize the catalyst complex, improving the reaction yield.

- **Rigidity of Structure**: Rigid structures, such as fused aromatic rings or lactone systems, facilitate better alignment and coordination with the catalyst, enhancing the yield.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low reaction yield based on its structural features. The rules balance broad coverage with specificity, combining multiple functional groups and considering the interplay of electronic and steric factors.

**Coverage and Balance**

- **Simple Rules with Higher Coverage**: Rules 1, 3, and 7 address broad structural features (aliphatic acids, electron-withdrawing/donating groups on aromatic rings) and cover multiple examples and counterexamples in the dataset.

- **Complex Rules with Lower Coverage**: Rules 10 and 15 involve more specific combinations of functional groups and structural motifs (e.g., indole-containing amino acids, ketone groups with compensating electron-donating groups), providing nuanced predictions for specific cases.

This set of rules maintains a suitable balance between simplicity and complexity, ensuring broader applicability while accounting for specific structural intricacies affecting the reaction yield.

**Application**

Researchers can use these rules to design or select molecular modifiers that are more likely to produce high yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By analyzing potential modifiers through the lens of these rules, one can predict their effectiveness and optimize the reaction conditions accordingly.---------------------------------------------------------------

    **Analysis of Current Rules and Dataset**

After analyzing the provided dataset and the current set of rules, I've identified opportunities to refine the rules for better clarity, coverage, and alignment with the underlying physical-chemical principles. Below is a revised set of rules that more effectively describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the relative high or low yield of the reaction.

---

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups yield a high value of yield due to favorable hydrophobic interactions and minimal steric hindrance. Introduction of polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) lowers the yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *Octanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexamples*:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Low yield; hydroxyl group increases polarity)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield; amino group introduces polarity and potential unwanted interactions)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with short, non-bulky, polar side chains (e.g., carboxylate, hydroxyl) yield a high value of yield due to effective coordination with the catalyst's metal centers. Bulky or aromatic side chains reduce the yield due to steric hindrance and decreased coordination efficiency.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid, High yield)
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid, High yield)
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexamples*:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine, Low yield)
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Low yield; additional amide group adds steric bulk)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position yield a high value of yield due to increased acidity and enhanced metal coordination. Electron-donating groups or aldehydes at the para position lower the yield due to decreased acidity or potential side reactions.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (High yield)
  - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexamples*:
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Low yield; methyl group is electron-donating)
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Low yield; aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heterocycle yield a high value of yield due to strong coordination through the heteroatom. Additional aromatic rings or bulky substituents decrease the yield due to steric hindrance.**

  *Examples*:
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid, High yield)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (High yield)
  - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexample*:
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Low yield; additional benzene ring increases steric bulk)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol groups (-SH) on short aliphatic chains yield a high value of yield due to strong sulfur-metal coordination. Thiol groups on aromatic rings yield a low value of yield due to reduced accessibility and less effective coordination.**

  *Example*:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexample*:
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) yield a high value of yield due to multiple hydrogen bonding interactions and chelation with the catalyst. Monohydroxylated acids typically yield a low value of yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid, High yield)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexample*:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Low yield; single hydroxyl group insufficient)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains yield a low value of yield due to the electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms, which reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.**

  *Example*:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (Low yield)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde groups conjugated to aromatic rings yield a low value of yield due to potential side reactions with the catalyst and inhibition of coordination sites.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (Low yield)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with indole side chains yield a high value of yield due to π–π stacking interactions and potential coordination via the indole nitrogen. Amino acids with phenyl side chains without heteroatoms yield a low value of yield due to lack of coordination ability and increased steric hindrance.**

  *Example*:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan, High yield)

  *Counterexample*:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine, Low yield)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (7 carbons or more) bearing polar functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) yield a low value of yield due to increased steric hindrance and reduced effective coordination with the catalyst.**

  *Examples*:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Counterexample*:
  - *Octanoic acid* (High yield; absence of polar groups)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether groups yield a low value of yield due to increased polarity and potential interference with catalyst interactions.**

  *Example*:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (Low yield)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with secondary functional groups capable of chelation or competition with the catalyst's active sites (e.g., ketones, amides, additional carboxyl groups) yield a low value of yield due to interference with catalyst performance.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Low yield; ketone group)
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Low yield; amide group)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy, methyl) at the para position yield a low value of yield due to decreased acidity and less effective coordination with the metal catalyst.**

  *Example*:
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)

---

**Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst and increasing yield. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, reducing coordination efficiency and yield.

- **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents and long chains with polar groups introduce steric hindrance, interfering with catalyst access and decreasing yield.

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups capable of strong coordination (e.g., amino, thiol, indole nitrogen) enhance interactions with the metal catalyst, improving yield. Proper positioning is crucial for effective coordination.

- **Hydrogen Bonding and Chelation**: Polyhydroxylated acids can form multiple hydrogen bonds and chelate with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst complex and increasing yield.

- **π–π Interactions**: Modifiers with aromatic rings capable of π–π stacking (e.g., indole rings) stabilize the catalyst-modifier complex, enhancing yield.

- **Hydrophobic Interactions**: Non-polar aliphatic chains favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, leading to higher yields.

- **Competitive Coordination**: Functional groups like aldehydes and ketones may compete with the catalyst's active site or participate in side reactions, reducing yield.

---

**Coverage and Balance**

This set of 13 rules maintains a suitable balance between simplicity and complexity:

- **Simple Rules with Higher Coverage**:
  - **Rule 1** addresses straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids.
  - **Rule 2** covers α-amino acids based on side chain characteristics.
  - **Rule 3** focuses on aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups.

- **Complex Rules with Lower Coverage**:
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 9** target specific functional groups like thiols and indole rings.
  - **Rule 6** addresses polyhydroxylated acids with multiple hydrogen bonding capabilities.

These rules collectively cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, providing clear guidance for predicting the reaction yield based on structural features.

---

**Application**

Applying these rules allows for the prediction of whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By understanding the relationship between functional groups, steric factors, and electronic properties, researchers can rationally design or select modifiers to optimize reaction conditions and enhance efficiency.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with short, polar side chains containing additional carboxylate groups result in a **high** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid) (High yield)
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid) (High yield)
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Explanation*: Additional carboxylate groups enhance coordination with the metal catalyst without causing significant steric hindrance, improving catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in a **low** yield; however, if the aromatic side chain contains heteroatoms capable of coordination, the yield is **high**.**

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine) (Low yield)

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan) (High yield)

  *Explanation*: Aromatic side chains without coordinating sites hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. Heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole) can coordinate with the metal, enhancing yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles result in a **high** yield, especially when the nitrogen is part of the ring.**

  *Examples*:
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (High yield)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (High yield)
  - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (High yield)

  *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing stability and reactivity.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) result in a **high** yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) result in a **low** yield.**

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (High yield)

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing coordination with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups in the para position result in a **high** yield due to additional coordination, despite the amino group being electron-donating.**

  *Example*:
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (High yield)

  *Explanation*: The amino group can act as an additional coordination site with the metal catalyst, compensating for its electron-donating nature.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (6 carbons or more) and no additional polar functional groups result in a **high** yield.**

  *Example*:
  - *Octanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexamples*:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Hydrophobic chains facilitate optimal interaction with the catalyst surface without interfering polar groups.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (6 carbons or more) and additional polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) result in a **low** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Polar groups on long chains introduce steric hindrance and can disrupt effective coordination with the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in a **high** yield due to multiple coordination sites.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid) (High yield)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (High yield)

  *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enable extensive hydrogen bonding and chelation with the metal catalyst.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with thiol groups attached to short aliphatic chains result in a **high** yield; thiol groups on aromatic rings result in a **low** yield.**

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing activity, while aromatic thiols may have reduced reactivity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups result in a **low** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or inhibit catalyst activity by irreversible binding.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages in the chain result in a **low** yield.**

  *Example*:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Ether linkages increase flexibility and polarity, which can disrupt optimal binding to the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in a **low** yield due to decreased coordinating ability.**

  *Example*:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms reduce the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with extended aliphatic chains result in a **high** yield; shorter chains may not compensate for steric effects.**

  *High Yield Examples*:
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (High yield)
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Longer aliphatic chains increase flexibility and reduce steric hindrance near the active site.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with additional functional groups capable of strong chelation (e.g., multiple carbonyl groups) may result in a **low** yield due to catalyst deactivation.**

  *Example*:
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Over-chelation can form overly stable complexes with the metal catalyst, reducing its activity.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with long aliphatic side chains or bulky substituents result in a **low** yield due to steric hindrance.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Large or long side chains can hinder effective coordination between the modifier and the catalyst.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids containing side chains with additional carboxylate groups result in a **high** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid) (High yield)
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid) (High yield)
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Explanation*: Additional carboxylate groups enhance coordination with the metal catalyst (Fe), improving its activity by providing multiple binding sites.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in a **low** yield; however, if the aromatic side chain contains coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen), the yield is **high**.**

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine) (Low yield)

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan) (High yield)

  *Explanation*: Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms do not facilitate effective metal coordination. Heteroatoms like nitrogen can bond with the metal center, enhancing stability and reactivity.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles result in a **high** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (High yield)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (High yield)
  - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (High yield)
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings serve as coordination sites for the metal catalyst, enhancing its reactivity by facilitating electron transfer.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, aldehyde) result in a **high** yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) result in a **low** yield.**

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (High yield)

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (High yield due to extended conjugation)

  *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing metal coordination. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity, diminishing coordination efficiency.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups capable of coordination result in a **high** yield, despite the amino group being electron-donating.**

  *Example*:
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (High yield)

  *Explanation*: The amino group provides an additional site for metal coordination, compensating for its electron-donating effect and enhancing catalyst interaction.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (6 carbons or more) and no additional polar functional groups result in a **high** yield.**

  *Example*:
  - *Octanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Explanation*: Hydrophobic chains can interact favorably with the catalyst's environment, aiding in substrate accessibility without hindering metal coordination.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (6 carbons or more) and additional polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) result in a **low** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Polar groups on long chains introduce steric hindrance and unfavorable polar interactions, disrupting effective coordination with the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups result in a **high** yield due to increased coordination sites.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid) (High yield)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (High yield)

  *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional sites for hydrogen bonding and metal coordination, enhancing catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with thiol groups attached to short aliphatic chains result in a **high** yield; thiol groups on aromatic rings result in a **low** yield.**

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with metal centers due to their high nucleophilicity. Aromatic thiols are less nucleophilic and may engage in less effective metal binding.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups result in a **low** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups can form irreversible complexes with the metal catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst availability.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that contain perfluorinated alkyl chains result in a **low** yield due to decreased coordinating ability.**

  *Example*:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with extended aliphatic chains (3 carbons or more) result in a **high** yield; shorter chains may not mitigate steric effects, leading to a **low** yield.**

  *High Yield Examples*:
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (High yield)
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and reduce steric hindrance near the coordination site, improving metal interaction.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages in the chain result in a **low** yield.**

  *Example*:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and polarity, potentially disrupting optimal binding and increasing steric hindrance around the metal center.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with adjacent carbonyl groups (e.g., ketones, amides) near the carboxylate result in a **low** yield due to possible over-chelation and catalyst deactivation.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Low yield)
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (Despite being high yield, may be an exception)

  *Explanation*: Additional carbonyl groups can form strong chelates with the metal, reducing catalyst turnover and activity.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with long aliphatic side chains or bulky substituents result in a **low** yield due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Explanation*: Bulky or long side chains can interfere with the metal catalyst's active sites, hindering effective complex formation.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids containing side chains with additional carboxylate groups (dicarboxylic amino acids) result in a **high** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid) — High yield
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid) — High yield

  *Explanation*: The presence of extra carboxylate groups enhances coordination with the Fe ion in the catalyst, providing multiple binding sites and increasing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms result in a **high** yield; those lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in a **low** yield.**

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan) — High yield

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine) — Low yield

  *Explanation*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen in the indole ring can coordinate with the Fe ion, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms do not facilitate effective metal coordination.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long unbranched chains (seven or more carbons) and no additional polar functional groups result in a **high** yield; introduction of polar groups lowers the yield.**

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *Octanoic acid* — High yield

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* — Low yield
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: Long hydrophobic chains enhance interactions with the catalyst environment and substrate accessibility without hindering metal coordination. Adding polar groups introduces steric hindrance or competing interactions that reduce yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy acids) result in a **high** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid) — High yield
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* — High yield

  *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites for the Fe ion, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in a **high** yield.**

  *Example*:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* — High yield

  *Explanation*: Thiol groups are strong nucleophiles and can effectively coordinate with the Fe ion, forming stable complexes that enhance catalyst performance.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in a **high** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* — High yield
  - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* — High yield

  *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the Fe ion and improving catalyst efficiency.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups result in a **low** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* — Low yield
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or form irreversible complexes with the Fe ion, deactivating the catalyst and reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages result in a **low** yield.**

  *Example*:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and polarity, which can disrupt optimal metal coordination and introduce steric hindrance around the Fe ion.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in a **low** yield due to decreased coordinating ability.**

  *Example*:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions and diminishing catalyst effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the ring result in a **high** yield when the nitrogen can coordinate with the Fe ion.**

  *Examples*:
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* — High yield
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* — High yield

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for the Fe ion, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. The effectiveness depends on the position of the nitrogen relative to the carboxylic acid group.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aliphatic side chains or additional amide groups result in a **low** yield due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* — Low yield
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: Bulky side chains or additional functional groups can interfere with access to the Fe ion's coordination sites, hindering effective catalyst formation and activity.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids containing side-chain carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic amino acids) result in a **high** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid) — High yield
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid) — High yield

  *Explanation*: The additional carboxyl group enhances coordination with the Fe ion, promoting effective catalyst formation and increasing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordinating with Fe (e.g., nitrogen in heterocycles or sulfur) result in a **high** yield; those lacking such heteroatoms result in a **low** yield.**

  *High Yield Examples*:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan) — High yield
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid* — High yield

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine) — Low yield
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: Side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with the Fe ion, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. Side chains without coordinating heteroatoms do not facilitate effective metal coordination.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long unbranched carbon chains (six carbons or more) and no additional polar functional groups result in a **high** yield; introduction of polar groups lowers the yield.**

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *Octanoic acid* — High yield

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* — Low yield
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: Long hydrophobic chains enhance interactions with the catalyst environment and substrate accessibility without hindering metal coordination. Adding polar groups introduces steric hindrance or competing interactions that reduce yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy acids) result in a **high** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid) — High yield
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* — High yield

  *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites for the Fe ion, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in a **high** yield; aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in a **low** yield.**

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* — High yield

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: Thiol groups are strong nucleophiles and can effectively coordinate with the Fe ion. In aliphatic acids, this coordination is unhindered, enhancing catalyst performance. In aromatic acids, steric and electronic factors reduce the effectiveness of thiol coordination.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in a **high** yield; those with electron-donating groups or less electron-withdrawing groups result in a **low** yield.**

  *High Yield Examples*:
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* — High yield
  - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* — High yield

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the Fe ion. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination efficiency.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups result in a **low** yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* — Low yield
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or form irreversible complexes with the Fe ion, deactivating the catalyst and reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids where a nitrogen-containing heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high** yield; those where the heterocycle is attached via an additional ring result in a **low** yield.**

  *High Yield Examples*:
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* — High yield
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* — High yield

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: When the coordinating nitrogen is in close proximity to the carboxylate group, it can effectively coordinate with the Fe ion. Additional rings can hinder this interaction due to increased steric bulk and electronic delocalization.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in a **low** yield.**

  *Example*:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions and diminishing catalyst effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages and lack multiple hydroxyl groups result in a **low** yield; those with multiple hydroxyl groups result in a **high** yield.**

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* — Low yield

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* — High yield

  *Explanation*: Ether linkages without additional hydroxyl groups introduce flexibility and polarity that can disrupt optimal metal coordination. In contrast, ethers with multiple hydroxyls provide additional coordination sites, enhancing yield.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky side chains or additional amide groups result in a **low** yield due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  *Example*:
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: Bulky side chains or additional functional groups can interfere with access to the Fe ion's coordination sites, hindering effective catalyst formation and activity.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aryl-aliphatic carboxylic acids with longer aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) result in a **high** yield; shorter chains result in a **low** yield.**

  *High Yield Example*:
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* — High yield

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: Longer aliphatic chains may position the aromatic ring favorably for interactions without hindering coordination with the Fe ion. Shorter chains may not provide the optimal spatial arrangement, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) at positions that interfere with Fe coordination result in a **low** yield.**

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* — Low yield

  *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups may reduce the acidity of the carboxylic acid and hinder effective coordination with the Fe ion, lowering catalyst activity.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules collectively describe how the structural features of molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the modifiers, we can predict their effect on the reaction yield based on underlying physical and chemical principles such as metal coordination, steric hindrance, and electronic effects.

- Modifiers enhancing Fe coordination without introducing steric hindrance or electronic disruption tend to result in **high** yields.
- Modifiers introducing steric hindrance, lacking coordinating groups, or bearing electron-donating groups that interfere with metal coordination tend to result in **low** yields.

These rules provide a predictive framework for selecting or designing molecular modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with carbon chains of five or more carbons and **no terminal polar groups** (e.g., hydroxy, amino) result in a **high** yield. If the aliphatic chain has **terminal polar groups**, they result in a **low** yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid* — High yield
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* — Low yield
    - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* — Low yield
    - *8-Aminooctanoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Non-polar aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, promoting better substrate accessibility and catalytic efficiency. Terminal polar groups can interfere with metal coordination or introduce steric hindrance, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids containing additional carboxylate groups** in the side chain (**dicarboxylic amino acids**) result in a **high** yield.**

  - *Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid) — High yield
    - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid) — High yield

  - *Explanation*: Additional carboxylate groups provide extra coordination sites for the Fe ion, enhancing catalyst formation and activity through stronger metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** at the para position (e.g., nitro, halomethyl) result in a **high** yield; those with **electron-donating groups** at the para position result in a **low** yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid* — High yield
    - *4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid* — High yield
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* — Low yield
    - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the Fe ion. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and coordination efficiency, diminishing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups** at the para position result in a **high** yield.**

  - *Example*:
    - *4-Aminobenzoic acid* — High yield

  - *Explanation*: The amino group can act as a bidentate ligand, coordinating with the Fe ion through both the amino and carboxylate groups. This strengthens metal-ligand interactions and enhances catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing **nitrogen heterocycles** directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high** yield; if the nitrogen heterocycle is attached via an additional aromatic ring, resulting in a rigid structure, the yield is **low**.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid) — High yield
    - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* — High yield
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as effective coordination sites for the Fe ion when directly attached, promoting catalyst formation. Rigid structures with additional aromatic rings can cause steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency and yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles** result in a **high** yield; **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains** lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in a **low** yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *(2R)-2-Amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan) — High yield
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine) — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen heterocycles in side chains provide additional coordination sites for the Fe ion. This strengthens metal-ligand interactions and improves catalytic activity. Bulky side chains without coordinating heteroatoms can cause steric hindrance, preventing effective interaction with the Fe ion.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with internal thiol groups** result in a **high** yield; **aromatic thiol carboxylic acids** result in a **low** yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid* — High yield
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: In aliphatic acids, thiol groups are more available for coordination with the Fe ion, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, the thiol group's lone pair can delocalize into the aromatic system, reducing its availability for coordination.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups** adjacent to the ring result in a **low** yield.**

  - *Examples*:
    - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* — Low yield
    - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups can interact with the Fe ion, forming inactive complexes or engaging in side reactions. This depletes the active catalyst species, lowering the reaction yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are **perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in a **low** yield.**

  - *Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with the Fe ion. This results in less effective catalyst formation and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups**, particularly **polyhydroxy aliphatic acids**, result in a **high** yield.**

  - *Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* — High yield
    - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* — High yield

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and facilitate hydrogen bonding networks. This stabilizes the Fe ion and enhances catalytic activity through effective metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with internal ether linkages** and multiple hydroxyl groups result in a **high** yield; those with **terminal ether groups** and fewer hydroxyls result in a **low** yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* — High yield
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Internal ether linkages with multiple hydroxyl groups enhance the ability to coordinate with the Fe ion. Terminal ether groups offer less coordination due to steric hindrance and fewer hydroxyl groups, reducing catalytic effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains containing sulfur in a thioether linkage** result in a **low** yield.**

  - *Example*:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Thioether sulfur is less effective in coordinating with the Fe ion compared to thiol sulfur. Additionally, bulky sulfur-containing side chains can cause steric hindrance, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules describe how combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the **high** or **low** yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By focusing on direct combinations of substructures and considering physicochemical properties such as metal coordination ability, steric effects, electronic effects, and hydrogen bonding, we can predict the impact of modifiers on the reaction yield.

- **High Yield Modifiers**: Typically possess functional groups that enhance coordination with the Fe ion without causing steric hindrance. Examples include:

  - **Aliphatic carboxylic acids** with long hydrophobic chains and **no terminal polar groups**.
  - **Amino acids** with additional **carboxylate groups** or **nitrogen-containing heterocycles** in side chains.
  - **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** at the para position.
  - Compounds with accessible **nitrogen heterocycles** directly attached to the carboxyl group.
  - **Polyhydroxy aliphatic acids** and those with **internal ether linkages** and multiple hydroxyl groups.
  - Aliphatic carboxylic acids with **internal thiol groups**.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**: Often contain functional groups that interfere with Fe coordination or diminish catalytic activity. These include:

  - **Aliphatic acids** with **terminal polar groups** (e.g., hydroxy, amino).
  - **Amino acids** with **bulky, non-coordinating side chains** (e.g., phenyl group).
  - **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating groups** or **aldehyde groups** adjacent to the ring.
  - Compounds with rigid structures causing **steric hindrance**.
  - **Perfluorinated acids** and **aromatic thiol acids** where coordinating atoms are less available.
  - Amino acids with **thioether-containing side chains**.

By applying these rules, one can predict the potential effectiveness of new molecular modifiers in the reaction and guide the design of modifiers to optimize and control the yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids** with side chains containing **additional carboxyl groups** (dicarboxylic amino acids like aspartic acid and glutamic acid) result in a **high** yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid) — High yield
    - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid) — High yield

  - *Explanation*: The additional carboxyl group in the side chain provides extra coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing catalyst formation through stronger metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with substituents capable of **coordinating with Fe ions**, such as **amino groups** or **nitrogen heterocycles**, generally result in a **high** yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Aminobenzoic acid* — High yield
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* — High yield
    - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* — High yield
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Functional groups that can coordinate with Fe ions enhance catalyst formation. However, the specific position of substituents and overall molecular structure influence effectiveness. In some cases, steric hindrance or electronic effects may reduce coordination efficiency despite the presence of coordinating groups.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids** result in a **high** yield.**

  - *Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* — High yield
    - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* — High yield
    - *2-Oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* — High yield

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as coordination sites, enhancing interaction with Fe ions in the catalyst. This strong metal-ligand interaction improves catalyst stability and activity.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids** with side chains containing **nitrogen heterocycles** (e.g., tryptophan) result in a **high** yield; those with **aromatic side chains lacking coordinating groups** (e.g., phenylalanine) result in a **low** yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *(2R)-2-Amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan) — High yield
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine) — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen heterocycles provide additional coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms offer no such benefit and may introduce steric hindrance.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing substituents** (e.g., nitro groups) result in a **high** yield, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents** (e.g., methyl, methoxy) result in a **low** yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid* — High yield
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* — Low yield
    - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken metal coordination, reducing catalyst formation and activity.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy aliphatic acids** (e.g., sugar acids) result in a **high** yield.**

  - *Example*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid) — High yield

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate Fe ions through coordination bonds and hydrogen bonding, enhancing catalyst stability and improving yield.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are **perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in a **low** yield.**

  - *Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms reduce the electron density on the carboxylate group, diminishing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions and leading to lower catalyst activity.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde groups** on the aromatic ring result in a **low** yield.**

  - *Examples*:
    - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* — Low yield
    - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or interfere with Fe ion coordination, reducing the effectiveness of catalyst formation and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **terminal thiol groups** result in a **high** yield; **thiol groups attached to aromatic rings** result in a **low** yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid* — High yield
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Thiol groups in aliphatic chains are readily available for coordination with Fe ions, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic systems, thiol groups may be less accessible due to resonance stabilization, reducing their coordination ability.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with **sterically hindered substituents** that lack coordinating ability result in a **low** yield.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* — Low yield
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Methionine derivative) — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Bulky substituents can cause steric hindrance, impeding effective interaction between the modifier and Fe ions, thus reducing catalyst formation and activity.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that contain **ether linkages** with limited hydroxyl groups result in a **low** yield, whereas those with **multiple hydroxyl groups** result in a **high** yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* — High yield
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Hydroxyl groups enhance coordination with Fe ions through hydrogen bonding and chelation, improving catalyst stability. Ether linkages without sufficient hydroxyl groups lack these interactions, resulting in lower yield.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules combine multiple functional groups and structural features to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. They consider underlying physicochemical properties such as metal coordination ability, steric effects, electronic effects, and chelation potential.

By applying these rules, researchers can:

- **Predict High Yield Modifiers**: Look for compounds with functional groups that enhance coordination with Fe ions (e.g., additional carboxylate groups, nitrogen heterocycles, multiple hydroxyl groups, electron-withdrawing substituents).

- **Identify Low Yield Modifiers**: Avoid compounds with functional groups that interfere with Fe coordination (e.g., electron-donating groups, aldehydes, perfluorinated chains) or have steric hindrance.

This approach aids in optimizing and controlling the reaction yield by selecting appropriate molecular modifiers based on their structural features.---------------------------------------------------------------

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - *5-Aminopentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Lysine derivative)
    - *8-Aminooctanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Additional acidic groups (like carboxyl or hydroxyl) in the side chain increase the molecule's ability to coordinate with Fe ions through additional binding sites and hydrogen bonding. This enhances the formation and activity of the Fe-based catalyst. Non-polar or bulky side chains lack these coordination sites and may introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst formation and activity.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing substituents** (e.g., nitro, halogens) in the **para position** result in a **high yield**; those with **electron-donating substituents** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Methylbenzoic acid*
    - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate ion, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, diminishing coordination ability. The para position maximizes this effect due to resonance.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that contain **nitrogen-containing heterocycles** (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) attached directly or via short linkers to the **carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**; those with **bulky aromatic linkers** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing catalyst formation. Short linkers ensure effective metal-ligand interactions. Bulky aromatic linkers introduce steric hindrance, impeding coordination.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**; those with **insufficient hydroxyl groups** or **hydroxyl groups far from the carboxylate** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate enhance Fe ion coordination through chelation and hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxylate or in insufficient numbers cannot effectively participate in metal coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **accessible thiol groups** result in a **high yield**; those with **thiol groups in aromatic systems** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Thiol groups are strong ligands for Fe ions due to their soft Lewis base character. In aliphatic chains, thiol groups are more accessible for coordination. In aromatic systems, thiol groups are less available due to resonance stabilization with the aromatic ring, reducing their ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde or acyl substituents** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Aldehyde and acyl groups can interfere with Fe ion coordination by either participating in side reactions (e.g., forming Schiff bases with amines) or by withdrawing electron density from the carboxylate group, weakening its coordinating ability.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are **perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in a **low yield** due to reduced electron density on the carboxylate group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the electron density of the carboxylate, weakening its coordination to Fe ions. This results in less effective catalyst formation.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **amino groups on short chains** (up to 5 carbons) result in a **high yield**; those with **amino groups on longer chains** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-Aminopentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-Aminooctanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Amino groups on short chains can effectively coordinate with Fe ions by forming stable chelates. On longer chains, the amino group is spatially distant from the carboxylate, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination (chelation) and potentially introducing steric hindrance.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are **ethers with multiple hydroxyl groups** near the **carboxylate** result in a **high yield**; ethers lacking sufficient hydroxyl groups result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination with Fe ions through hydrogen bonding and chelation. Ethers without enough hydroxyl groups cannot provide these interactions, resulting in weaker metal coordination and lower catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents directly attached to the ring** result in a **low yield**; increasing the distance between bulky groups and the carboxylate leads to a **high yield**.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
    - *2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group cause steric hindrance, impeding effective coordination with Fe ions. A longer aliphatic linker distances the bulky group from the carboxylate, reducing steric effects and allowing better metal-ligand interactions.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. They consider underlying physicochemical properties such as metal coordination ability, steric effects, electronic effects, and chelation potential.

**Application of the Rules:**

1. **Predicting High Yield Modifiers:**
   - **Amino Acids with Acidic Side Chains (Rule 1):** Look for amino acids containing additional carboxyl or hydroxyl groups in their side chains, enhancing coordination with Fe ions.
     - *Examples:* Aspartic acid, Glutamic acid, 5-Aminopentanoic acid.
   - **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups (Rule 2):** Select modifiers with nitro, halogen, or other electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position.
     - *Examples:* 4-Nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid.
   - **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles (Rule 3):** Use modifiers with pyridine, pyrazole, or similar rings directly attached or closely linked to the carboxyl group.
     - *Examples:* Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.
   - **Polyhydroxy Aliphatic Acids (Rule 4):** Opt for aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate.
     - *Examples:* Gluconic acid.
   - **Aliphatic Thiolacids (Rule 5):** Utilize aliphatic carboxylic acids with accessible thiol groups.
     - *Example:* 3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid.
   - **Short-Chain Amino Acids (Rule 8):** Consider aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups on short chains for effective chelation.
     - *Example:* 5-Aminopentanoic acid.
   - **Ethers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups (Rule 9):** Include modifiers where ethers have sufficient hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate.
     - *Example:* 2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.
   - **Aromatic Acids with Distant Bulky Groups (Rule 10):** Choose modifiers where bulky substituents are separated from the carboxylate by an aliphatic linker.
     - *Example:* 5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

2. **Identifying Low Yield Modifiers:**
   - **Amino Acids with Non-Polar/Bulky Side Chains (Rule 1):** Avoid amino acids with side chains that lack coordination sites or introduce steric hindrance.
     - *Examples:* Phenylalanine, 8-Aminooctanoic acid.
   - **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups (Rule 2):** Refrain from using modifiers with methyl, methoxy, or other electron-donating substituents at the para position.
     - *Examples:* 4-Methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.
   - **Modifiers with Bulky Aromatic Linkers (Rule 3):** Avoid modifiers where heterocycles are attached via bulky aromatic rings.
     - *Example:* 4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.
   - **Modifiers Lacking Sufficient Hydroxyl Groups (Rule 4 & 9):** Exclude aliphatic acids or ethers that do not have enough hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate.
     - *Examples:* 7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid, 2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.
   - **Aromatic Thiol Acids (Rule 5):** Do not use thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids.
     - *Example:* 4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid.
   - **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Acyl Substituents (Rule 6):** Steer clear of modifiers with aldehyde or acyl groups.
     - *Examples:* 4-Formylbenzoic acid, 4-Oxoheptanedioic acid.
   - **Perfluorinated Acids (Rule 7):** Exclude modifiers that are perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids.
     - *Example:* 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid.
   - **Long-Chain Amino Acids (Rule 8):** Avoid amino acids with amino groups on long aliphatic chains.
     - *Examples:* 7-Aminoheptanoic acid, 8-Aminooctanoic acid.
   - **Modifiers with Sterically Hindered Carboxylate Groups (Rule 10):** Do not use modifiers where bulky groups are adjacent to the carboxylate.
     - *Examples:* 4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

**Underlying Physicochemical Principles:**

- **Coordination Ability:** Modifiers that can effectively coordinate with Fe ions through multiple binding sites (e.g., carboxylate, hydroxyl, amino, thiol, nitrogen heterocycles) enhance catalyst formation and activity.
- **Steric Effects:** Bulky groups near coordination sites impede effective metal-ligand interactions due to steric hindrance.
- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylate anion, while electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.
- **Chelation Potential:** Modifiers capable of chelating Fe ions through multiple neighboring donor atoms form more stable complexes, improving catalyst performance.
- **Side Reactions:** Functional groups like aldehydes may participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of the modifier to coordinate with Fe ions.

**Note on Rule Application:**

When evaluating a new modifier:

- **Consider All Applicable Rules:** A compound may fall under multiple rules; assess each rule's impact based on the modifier's structure.
- **Balance Between Features:** Some features may enhance yield, while others may diminish it. Prioritize modifiers where the enhancing features dominate.
- **Physicochemical Context:** Think about how the modifier's functional groups interact during catalyst formation and the reaction process.

---

**Summary:**

These rules provide a comprehensive framework for predicting the efficacy of molecular modifiers in enhancing the yield of the target reaction. By focusing on the presence and combination of specific functional groups and structural features, grounded in coordination chemistry and steric considerations, researchers can make informed decisions when selecting or designing new modifiers. This approach facilitates the optimization and control of the reaction yield, advancing the goals of the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------
