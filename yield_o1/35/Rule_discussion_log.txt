This is supported by multiple data points such as (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Entry 0), 5-aminopentanoic acid (Entry 3), and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Entry 2). The rule provides good physical-chemical insight into how the presence of both functional groups enhances the reaction, and it balances complexity and coverage well.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly states that modifiers with aromatic rings bearing electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (-NO₂) or amino (-NH₂) at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group lead to high yield. This is supported by entries such as 4-aminobenzoic acid (Entry 4) and 4-nitrobenzoic acid (Entry 21). The rule offers strong property insight into the effect of electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings and has good coverage, enhancing its reliability.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in indicating that modifiers with aldehyde groups (-CHO) adjacent to the aromatic ring or aliphatic chain result in low yield.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 specifies that modifiers containing highly fluorinated alkyl chains or perfluorinated groups lead to low yield. This is supported by 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid (Entry 14) and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid (Entry 29). The rule is clear, provides property insight into the effects of fluorination on the reaction, and has adequate coverage, reinforcing its validity.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly states that modifiers with ether linkages (-O-) in their aliphatic chains tend to result in low yield. This is evidenced by 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (Entry 11) and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (Entry 33). The rule offers insight into how ether linkages might interfere with catalyst interactions or reaction pathways, and it has acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 distinguishes between thiol groups on aliphatic chains versus aromatic rings, stating that the former leads to high yield while the latter leads to low yield. This is supported by 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (Entry 18, high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (Entry 10, low yield). The rule is clear and provides valuable insight into the positional effects of thiol groups, though its coverage is based on two data points.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 states that aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups and with medium chain lengths (6-8 carbons) result in high yield, exemplified by octanoic acid (Entry 5). While the rule is clear and provides property insight, it is only supported by a single data point, limiting its coverage and the confidence in its general applicability.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 suggests that modifiers with large bulky substituents or multiple functional groups that could chelate or strongly interact with metal centers result in low yield. This is backed by data from 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid (Entry 24) and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid (Entry 27). The rule provides insight into steric and coordination effects but is somewhat vague and has limited coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 asserts that modifiers with electron-donating groups like methyl (-CH₃) on the aromatic ring lead to low yield, as seen with 4-methylbenzoic acid (Entry 23). The rule is clear and provides insight into electronic effects on the reaction, but it is supported by only one data point, which limits its coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 indicates that modifiers containing indole groups result in high yield, supported by (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Entry 15).

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows us to easily determine whether a modifier will result in high yield based on the presence of amino (-NH₂) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups on a short aliphatic chain (3-5 carbons). It combines chain length with specific functional groups, providing good property insight into how these groups may interact favorably with the catalyst. The rule is supported by multiple data points, such as 5-aminopentanoic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, both yielding high results, thus satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clearly defined, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position. This enables straightforward classification of modifiers. The rule provides chemical insight into how EWGs might enhance yield, possibly by stabilizing intermediates or facilitating interactions with the catalyst. It is adequately supported by the data, with 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid both resulting in high yield, so the coverage is sufficient.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear and specifies that modifiers with electron-donating groups (EDGs) on aromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid group lead to low yield. The rule offers property insight by indicating the impact of EDGs on the reaction yield, possibly due to electronic effects that hinder necessary interactions with the catalyst. It is backed by data points such as 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, both resulting in low yield, ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** clearly identifies modifiers with aldehyde groups adjacent to aromatic rings or within aliphatic chains as leading to low yield. The rule suggests property insight, as aldehyde groups could interfere with the catalyst or react with intermediates, negatively impacting the reaction. It is supported by data points such as 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, both yielding low results, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** states that medium-chain (6-8 carbons) aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield. While the rule is clear and provides property insight by highlighting the effect of chain length and simplicity of structure, its coverage is limited. Only octanoic acid supports this rule directly, and no other data points are given to reinforce it. Therefore, the rule lacks sufficient coverage as per the criteria.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** clearly defines that modifiers with polar functional groups on long aliphatic chains (6 carbons or more) result in low yield. This combines chain length with functional group presence, providing property insight into how polar groups may negatively affect the reaction, possibly due to steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions with the catalyst. The rule is well-supported by multiple data points, including 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, both yielding low results, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** specifies that modifiers with ether linkages or multiple oxygen-containing groups in their aliphatic chains result in low yield. While the rule is clear, coverage is limited, with only one direct data point (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) supporting it. Additionally, there is a contradictory data point—modifier 6 (2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid)—which contains multiple oxygen groups yet results in high yield. This suggests that the rule may not universally apply and lacks adequate coverage.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** attempts to associate high yield with modifiers containing pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid group, with the nitrogen in the meta position (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid). It provides property insight into how the position of nitrogen may influence the interaction with the catalyst. However, the rule's clarity is weakened by exceptions. For instance, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (modifier 25), which has the pyridine ring connected via an aliphatic chain, results in high yield, contradicting the rule's prediction for such structures. This indicates that the rule may lack sufficient coverage and may need refinement to account for such exceptions.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** clearly states that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or highly fluorinated groups result in low yield. This rule provides property insight into how fluorination may hinder the reaction, possibly due to strong electronegativity affecting catalyst interactions. It is supported by data points such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid, both resulting in low yield, thus satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** indicates that modifiers containing indole rings result in high yield. The rule is clear and provides property insight into the potential positive effect of indole rings, possibly due to π-π interactions or coordination with the catalyst. However, it lacks sufficient coverage, as only one data point (tryptophan) supports it. Without additional data points, it's difficult to conclusively validate this rule according to the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear in specifying that modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield, whereas thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield. The rule provides property insight by highlighting how the positioning of thiol groups affects the reaction, possibly due to varying abilities to interact with the catalyst. It is well-supported by data, with 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid yielding high and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid yielding low, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** suggests that modifiers with bulky substituents or multiple functional groups capable of chelating or strongly interacting with metal centers result in low yield. While this rule offers property insight, it lacks clarity due to its broadness, making it difficult to definitively classify modifiers. The coverage is also limited; only one data point directly supports the rule, and there are possible contradictions, as some modifiers with multiple functional groups result in high yield. The rule may benefit from refinement or more specific criteria to improve clarity and coverage.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:
  *Rule 1 (Aliphatic Amino Acids - Short-Chain)*: This rule is clear and easy to apply, as it specifies modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with primary amino and carboxylic acid groups on short carbon chains (2-5 carbons). It combines multiple functional groups, adding complexity. The rule is supported by data points 0, 2, and 3 (entries for (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid, and 5-aminopentanoic acid), all yielding high, providing good coverage. The property insight is adequate, suggesting that these functional groups favorably influence the reaction yield.

- **Comment 2**:
  *Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups at Para Position)*: The rule is clearly defined, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position leading to high yield. It considers both the aromatic structure and the position of substituents, adding complexity. Supported by data points 4 and 21 (4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid), both yielding high, it has acceptable coverage. The property insight is sound, as electron-withdrawing groups can enhance interaction with the catalyst.

- **Comment 3**:
  *Rule 3 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups at Para Position)*: This rule is clear and specifies that electron-donating groups at the para position result in low yield. It combines structural features and substituent effects, adding complexity. Supported by data points 23 and 31 (4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), both yielding low, it has adequate coverage. The property insight is reasonable, attributing lower yields to the influence of electron-donating groups on catalyst interaction.

- **Comment 4**:
  *Rule 4 (Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids)*: The rule is clear, focusing on heteroaromatic rings directly attached to carboxylic acid groups leading to high yield. It adds complexity by considering ring heteroatoms. Supported by data points 8, 16, and 22 (2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and pyridine-3-carboxylic acid), all yielding high, it has good coverage. The property insight is acceptable, as heteroatoms may enhance catalyst interaction.

- **Comment 5**:
  *Rule 5 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups - Short-Chain)*: This rule is clear but has limited coverage, supported only by data point 18 (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), which yields high. It combines thiol groups with short aliphatic chains, adding some complexity. The property insight is plausible, given thiol groups' tendency to coordinate with metals, potentially affecting catalysis.

- **Comment 6**:
  *Rule 6 (Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids without Polar Substituents)*: The rule is clear but has minimal coverage, supported solely by data point 5 (octanoic acid), yielding high. It is simple in complexity and offers limited property insight, suggesting that non-polar long chains favor high yield, possibly due to hydrophobic interactions.

- **Comment 7**:
  *Rule 7 (Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups on Aromatic Rings)*: This rule is clear and supported by data points 19 and 20 (5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid), both yielding low. It combines structural features of aromatic rings with aldehyde groups, adding complexity. The property insight is reasonable, as aldehyde groups may partake in side reactions or deactivate the catalyst.

- **Comment 8**:
  *Rule 8 (Modifiers with Multiple Fluorine Atoms or Perfluorinated Chains)*: The rule is clear but has limited coverage, supported by data point 14 (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), yielding low. It adds complexity by considering perfluorination and offers property insight regarding the strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms, which may negatively impact yield.

- **Comment 9**:
  *Rule 9 (Aromatic Amino Acids)*: The rule lacks clarity due to conflicting data. While data point 15 (tryptophan) yields high as expected, data point 13 (phenylalanine) yields low, contradicting the rule. The complexity is acceptable, but the inconsistent coverage diminishes its reliability. The property insight may not be universally applicable to all aromatic amino acids.

- **Comment 10**:
  *Rule 10 (Modifiers with Short-Chain Polyfunctional Ethers)*: The rule is clear but supported by only one data point, 6 (2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid), yielding high. It has high complexity due to multiple functional groups and provides moderate property insight into how polyfunctional ethers may enhance yield, though coverage is limited.

- **Comment 11**:
  *Rule 11 (Modifiers with Long-Chain Polyfunctional Ethers)*: This rule is clear and supported by data point 11 (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), yielding low. It adds complexity with multiple oxygen-containing groups on long chains. Property insight is limited, and coverage is minimal, reducing confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 12**:
  *Rule 12 (Modifiers Capable of Metal Chelation)*: The rule is clear but has limited coverage, supported only by data point 24 (2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid), yielding low. Complexity is present due to the chelating groups. The property insight is reasonable, suggesting that metal chelation could interfere with catalyst activity.

- **Comment 13**:
  *Rule 13 (Aromatic Thiol Modifiers)*: The rule is clear but only supported by data point 10 (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), yielding low. It adds complexity by combining aromatic rings with thiol groups. The property insight is acceptable, considering strong metal binding by thiols, but the limited coverage weakens its robustness.

- **Comment 14**:
  *Rule 14 (Long-Chain Aliphatic Acids with Polar Substituents)*: This rule is clear and has good coverage, supported by data points 30, 32, and 34 (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid), all yielding low. It combines chain length with polar substituents, adding complexity. The property insight is acceptable, suggesting that polar groups on long chains may hinder desirable interactions in the reaction.

- **Comment 15**:
  *Rule 15 (Modifiers with Electron-Donating Aromatic Chains)*: This rule lacks reliability due to conflicting data. Data points 7 and 26 (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) both yield high, contrary to the rule's prediction of low yield. Clarity and complexity are acceptable, but the coverage contradicts the rule, indicating it may need revision or removal. The property insight does not align with the observed data.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and provides good property insight into how long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar functional groups enhance yield, possibly due to favorable hydrophobic interactions. It combines structural features (chain length and absence of polar groups), showing appropriate complexity. The rule is supported by multiple data points (e.g., octanoic acid with high yield and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid with low yield), ensuring adequate coverage and a good balance between complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and insightful, highlighting the impact of chain length in aliphatic α-amino acids on yield. It considers both the amino acid functional group and the chain length, demonstrating suitable complexity. Supported by several data points for both high yield (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) and low yield (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid), the rule has strong coverage and balances complexity with practical applicability.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear, allowing easy identification of modifiers that fit the description. It provides solid property insight into the effect of electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids on yield, likely enhancing metal coordination. The rule combines multiple structural elements, adding appropriate complexity. With multiple supporting examples (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid with high yield and 4-methylbenzoic acid with low yield), the rule has good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and offers valuable property insight into how heteroatoms in aromatic carboxylic acids improve yield through enhanced coordination with metal centers. The rule focuses on specific sub-structures, adding suitable complexity. It is supported by several data points (e.g., nicotinic acid and pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid with high yield), providing adequate coverage and a balanced approach.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in identifying modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups on aromatic rings that result in low yield. It provides reasonable property insight, suggesting that these groups may inhibit catalyst activity. The rule has a moderate level of complexity by focusing on specific functional groups attached to aromatic systems. However, coverage is limited to two data points (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid with low yield). While the rule meets the minimum coverage criterion, additional data would strengthen it.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and highlights the positive impact of thiol groups on aliphatic chains for yield, likely due to effective metal coordination. It combines functional group presence with chain type, adding complexity. The rule is based on minimal data points—one high yield example (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) and one low yield counter-example (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid). While the rule provides property insight, the limited coverage suggests that further data are needed to enhance its reliability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear about perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids yielding low, attributing it to strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity. The rule has specific complexity but is supported by only one data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid with low yield). The property insight is sound, but the limited coverage weakens the rule's robustness. Additional examples would improve its validity.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is somewhat specific but clear, distinguishing between alpha-amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains (high yield) and those with phenyl side chains (low yield). It offers good property insight into how heteroatoms in side chains can enhance coordination with the catalyst. The rule combines backbone and side-chain structures, adding complexity. However, it relies on limited data (e.g., tryptophan with high yield and phenylalanine with low yield). More data points are necessary to strengthen coverage and confirm the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and provides reasonable property insight into how polyether chains may adversely affect yield due to unfavorable catalyst interactions. It focuses on specific structural features, offering appropriate complexity. Supported by two data points with low yield (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), the rule meets the minimum coverage criterion. While coverage is minimal, it is sufficient for the rule to be considered valid.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear in describing how multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains enhance yield, possibly through improved solubility and coordination. The rule combines functional group multiplicity with chain type, adding complexity. With one high yield example (gluconic acid) and one low yield counter-example (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), coverage is limited. Additional supporting data would be beneficial to reinforce the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and provides insightful reasoning on how multiple directly connected aromatic rings can reduce yield due to steric hindrance and π-π stacking. It combines the presence of multiple aromatic rings and their connectivity, demonstrating appropriate complexity. The rule is supported by data points showing low yield (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) and a counter-example with high yield when the linker is extended (4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid). Coverage is adequate, and the balance between complexity and applicability is well-maintained.

- **Comment 1**:
  
  Rule 1 is clear and specifies that modifiers are short-chain (C4–C6) aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with an amino group at the alpha position, resulting in high yield. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining enhanced coordination due to the presence of two carboxylate groups and an amino group. The rule is sufficiently complex, considering combinations of substructures. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., aspartic acid and glutamic acid yielding high), satisfying the coverage criterion. Overall, Rule 1 meets all the criteria effectively.

---

- **Comment 2**:
  
  Rule 2 clearly distinguishes between alpha-amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains (yielding high) and those with simple aromatic side chains (yielding low). The property insight is strong, attributing the difference to enhanced coordination through lone pairs on heteroatoms. The rule is complex enough, considering both the amino acid backbone and side chain type. It is supported by examples like tryptophan (high yield) and phenylalanine (low yield), meeting the coverage requirement. Rule 2 aligns well with the criteria.

---

- **Comment 3**:
  
  Rule 3 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with para electron-donating groups yield high, while those with electron-withdrawing groups yield low. It provides clear structural criteria and property insight into how electron-donating groups enhance electron density and metal coordination. The rule is complex, involving both the aromatic ring and substituent effects. It is supported by multiple examples and counter-examples. However, the exception of 4-nitrobenzoic acid yielding high (despite the nitro group being electron-withdrawing) introduces inconsistency. Clarifying this exception within the rule would improve its clarity and applicability.

---

- **Comment 4**:
  
  Rule 4 is clear, specifying that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms yield high. The property insight is solid, explaining enhanced coordination via lone pair electrons on nitrogen. The rule considers ring structure and heteroatoms, adding complexity. With examples like nicotinic acid and pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid yielding high, the rule has adequate coverage. Rule 4 meets the criteria effectively.

---

- **Comment 5**:
  
  Rule 5 defines that long-chain (≥ C8) aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar groups yield high. It is clear and provides property insight by mentioning the hydrophobic nature promoting better interaction with the catalyst. The rule is complex, considering chain length and absence of polar groups. While octanoic acid supports the rule, coverage is limited with only one positive example and several counter-examples (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid yielding low). Additional data points supporting high yield would strengthen the rule's coverage.

---

- **Comment 6**:
  
  Rule 6 states that modifiers containing polyether chains yield low. The rule is clear and provides property insight by explaining how flexibility and hydrophilicity interfere with coordination. It considers the presence of multiple ether linkages, adding complexity. The rule is supported by examples such as 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid yielding low, satisfying the coverage criterion. Rule 6 meets the criteria effectively.

---

- **Comment 7**:
  
  Rule 7 specifies that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains yield low. The rule is clear and provides property insight, noting strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity reducing coordination. However, coverage is limited to a single example (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). To meet the coverage criterion more fully, additional data points supporting the rule are needed. Rule 7 partially meets the criteria but would benefit from enhanced coverage.

---

- **Comment 8**:
  
  Rule 8 indicates that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains yield high. The rule is clear, and the property insight is sound, highlighting additional coordination sites and increased solubility. Complexity is present by considering multiple functional groups. However, the rule's coverage is limited to a single example (gluconic acid). Additional supporting data points are necessary to fully meet the coverage criterion. Rule 8 partially satisfies the criteria.

---

- **Comment 9**:
  
  Rule 9 states that modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains yield high, while those attached to aromatics yield low. The rule is clear and provides property insight into the strong coordination ability of thiol groups and the potential steric or electronic hindrance when attached to aromatics. It is complex, considering both the functional group and its attachment. Supported by examples like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield), the rule meets the coverage criterion. Rule 9 aligns well with the criteria.

---

- **Comment 10**:
  
  Rule 10 asserts that aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups yield high. While the rule is clear and provides property insight into electron-donating effects, it overlaps significantly with Rule 3, which already covers electron-donating groups in the para position (including methoxy groups). This redundancy could be reduced by integrating Rule 10 into Rule 3 for better coherence and to avoid unnecessary complexity. The rule meets the criteria but could be streamlined.

---

- **Comment 11**:
  
  Rule 11 specifies that modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield low. The rule is clear and offers property insight into how electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density, hindering coordination. Complexity is present, considering the adjacency effect of functional groups. With examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid yielding low, the rule has adequate coverage. Rule 11 meets the criteria effectively.

---

- **Comment 12**:
  
  Rule 12 explains that modifiers with flexible linkers between aromatic rings yield high, while directly connected rings yield low. The rule is clear and provides property insight into steric hindrance and coordination efficiency. It is complex, considering the nature of linkers and ring connectivity. Supported by examples such as 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (high yield) and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (low yield), the rule meets the coverage criterion. Rule 12 aligns well with the criteria.

---

- **Comment 13**:
  
  Rule 13 posits that modifiers with polycyclic aromatic systems yield high. The rule is clear and offers property insight into enhanced π-electron delocalization improving coordination. However, the coverage is limited to a single example (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid). Additional examples are needed to fully satisfy the coverage criterion. Rule 13 partially meets the criteria but would benefit from more supporting data.

---

- **Comment 14**:
  
  Rule 14 states that modifiers with nitro groups on the aromatic ring yield high, despite nitro being an electron-withdrawing group. This contradicts Rule 3, which indicates that electron-withdrawing groups in the para position yield low. While Rule 14 provides an explanation that nitro groups may coordinate through oxygen atoms, the inconsistency between the rules could cause confusion. Clarifying and integrating this exception into Rule 3 or adjusting the rules to resolve the contradiction would improve clarity and coherence. Rule 14 partially meets the criteria but needs refinement.

---

- **Comment 15**:
  
  Rule 15 specifies that modifiers with aldehyde groups on aliphatic chains yield low. The rule is clear and provides property insight into reduced coordination ability or possible side reactions. It is complex, considering the position of functional groups. Supported by examples like 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid yielding low, the rule meets the coverage criterion. Rule 15 aligns well with the criteria.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and provides strong property insight by linking the presence of alpha-amino dicarboxylic acids to high yield due to multiple coordination sites with the metal center. It effectively combines substructures (amino and dicarboxylic groups) and is supported by multiple data points (aspartic acid and glutamic acid yielding high), demonstrating good coverage and balance.
- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is reasonably clear, emphasizing that amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains yield high, while those with nonpolar or simple aromatic side chains yield low. It offers chemical insight into coordination via heteroatoms. However, coverage is limited to few data points (tryptophan for high yield and phenylalanine for low yield), suggesting that additional data would strengthen the rule and improve balance.
- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and well-supported by multiple data points. It explains that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar groups yield high (e.g., octanoic acid), while those with polar substituents yield low. The rule combines substructures effectively and has good coverage and balance, making it a robust guideline.
- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and provides property insight by attributing low yield to modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains due to electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (nonafluoropentanoic acid yielding low), indicating low coverage. This limits the rule's general applicability and suggests a need for more supporting data.
- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and offers chemical reasoning that aromatic carboxylic acids with para electron-donating groups yield high due to enhanced electron density and metal coordination. It is supported by several data points (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid yielding high). However, there are exceptions (e.g., 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yielding low), indicating that additional factors like chain length may influence the outcome. Refinement of the rule could improve its clarity and coverage.
- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and demonstrates good property insight by explaining that para electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic carboxylic acids lead to low yield, with the exception of nitro groups which can coordinate through oxygen atoms. It is well-supported by data points and maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.
- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and provides solid chemical reasoning that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms yield high due to coordination via lone pair electrons. It effectively considers substructures and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., nicotinic acid and pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid yielding high), showing good coverage and balance.
- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and offers logical property insight that modifiers containing polyether chains yield low due to interference with metal coordination. It is supported by data points and maintains an appropriate level of complexity and coverage, making it a reliable rule.
- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and provides chemical reasoning that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains yield high by offering additional coordination sites. However, it is supported by only one data point (gluconic acid yielding high), indicating low coverage. This limits confidence in the rule, and more data are needed to confirm its validity.
- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and gives strong property insight into how the position of thiol groups affects yield—aliphatic thiols yield high while aromatic thiols yield low due to steric or electronic hindrance. It is supported by data points for both high and low yield cases, showing good coverage and balance.
- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and explains that modifiers with aldehyde or keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acid yield low due to decreased electron density for metal coordination. It has adequate coverage with supporting data points and provides solid chemical reasoning, making it a sound rule.
- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is somewhat complex but clear, highlighting that flexible aliphatic linkers between functional groups yield high, whereas rigid or directly connected groups yield low due to steric hindrance. It is supported by multiple data points and balances complexity with coverage effectively, providing valuable insight.
- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear but has low coverage, being supported by only one data point (benzofuran derivative yielding high). While it provides property insight into the role of polycyclic aromatic systems containing oxygen atoms, the limited data reduce confidence in the rule's general applicability.
- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear but redundant, as it restates an exception already covered in Rule 6 regarding nitro groups on aromatic rings yielding high. It has low coverage with only one supporting data point, suggesting that it could be consolidated with Rule 6 to improve clarity and reduce overlap.
- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and provides chemical reasoning that keto groups in conjugation with aromatic rings yield high by stabilizing coordination through delocalized π-systems. However, it is supported by only one data point, indicating low coverage. The rule may overlap with others involving aromatic ketones, suggesting a need for consolidation for better balance.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for easy identification of modifiers that fit the criteria, namely alpha-amino dicarboxylic acids. The property insight is sound, explaining that the combination of amino and two carboxylate groups enhances metal coordination. The rule considers a combination of substructures and is supported by multiple data points, fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is straightforward and clearly defines the structural requirements for high yield—simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar groups. The property insight effectively explains how the absence of extra polar groups minimizes undesired interactions, promoting better catalyst interaction. It combines multiple sub-structural features and is well-supported by examples and counter-examples.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and provides a direct correlation between electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic carboxylic acids and high yield. The property insight is strong, as it explains how electron-withdrawing groups increase electrophilicity, enhancing metal coordination. The rule is complex, considering both the aromatic ring and the substituents, and is backed by sufficient data points.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde or formyl groups yield low. The property insight is adequate, explaining that aldehydes can decrease electron density and engage in side reactions. The rule is specific to a combination of features and is supported by multiple examples, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and identifies nitrogen-containing heterocycles as high-yield modifiers. The property insight is solid, noting that nitrogen atoms provide lone pairs that enhance metal coordination. It considers combinations of substructures and is well-supported by several data points, meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 lacks some clarity due to the subjective nature of "near coordination sites" and "bulky." While the property insight regarding steric hindrance is valid, the rule is primarily based on a single example, which does not sufficiently meet the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, specifying that modifiers with polyether chains yield low. The property insight is reasonable, attributing the low yield to increased flexibility and hydrophilicity disrupting the reaction environment. It considers the combination of polyether chains with carboxylic acids and is supported by multiple examples.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and effectively communicates that polar groups on aliphatic chains yield low. The property insight is sound, explaining that these polar groups can interfere with the hydrophobic environment and metal coordination. It combines multiple sub-structural features and is well-supported by several data points.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and provides good property insight by explaining how multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains offer additional coordination sites, resulting in high yield. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple examples, fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, identifying modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains as yielding low. However, the property insight could be expanded upon, and the rule is based on a single example, which limits its coverage and reduces its overall strength.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11, while somewhat complex, is clear in describing modifiers with flexible aliphatic linkers to aromatic rings yielding high. The property insight is valid, as flexibility allows for better conformational adjustment and metal coordination. It combines several substructures and has adequate supporting examples.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear but lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one example. While the property insight about intramolecular hydrogen bonding reducing metal interaction is logical, more data points are needed to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides reasonable property insight by linking methoxy groups to enhanced electron density and potential coordination sites. However, the rule is based on a single example, which limits its coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 offers a nuanced description of how the position of sulfhydryl groups affects yield. The property insight is meaningful, but the rule's coverage is limited due to only one supporting example for each case, which diminishes its reliability.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 lacks clarity by stating that modifiers yield variable results based on additional factors. The property insight is not sufficiently developed, and the rule is supported by minimal data points, making it less actionable and effective.

These rules highlight the structural features of molecular modifiers that influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction:

- **Chelation Ability**: Modifiers capable of chelating the metal center through appropriately positioned donor atoms (e.g., carboxylate with adjacent amino or heteroatoms) enhance catalyst stability and activity.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups (like amino) or specific electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) on aromatic rings can facilitate metal coordination through modulation of electron density.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups can either hinder or enhance coordination depending on their ability to interact with the metal center without causing steric clashes.

- **Functional Group Interference**: Terminal polar groups or flexible chains can interfere with effective coordination, leading to lower yields.

- **Multiple Coordination Sites**: Modifiers with additional coordination sites (e.g., hydroxyl, sulfanyl groups) near the carboxylic acid can form more stable complexes.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict whether a molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield and can design new modifiers to optimize the catalytic performance of the Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe) system in the target reaction.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows unambiguous identification of modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids, predicting high yield. The underlying chemistry provides solid physicochemical insight relating to tridentate coordination enhancing catalytic activity. The rule combines functional groups (amino and two carboxylic acids), meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points (aspartic acid and glutamic acid yielding high, phenylalanine yielding low), satisfying coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is well maintained.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear, specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-amino or para-hydroxy groups yield high. The underlying chemistry, involving electron-donating groups enhancing metal coordination, is sound. The rule considers combinations of substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is backed by data points like 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yielding high, while 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid yield low, satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is well maintained.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clearly defined, focusing on heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with adjacent donor atoms yielding high. The underlying chemistry of bidentate chelation is reasonable. The rule incorporates combinations of substructures, satisfying complexity criteria. Supported by data points such as pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid yielding high, and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yielding low, it meets the coverage criterion. There is a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 states that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without terminal polar groups yield high, but the dataset provides limited support. While octanoic acid yields high, 5-aminopentanoic acid also yields high despite having a terminal amino group, contradicting the rule. Thus, the clarity is compromised due to exceptions, coverage is minimal with only one positive example, and the rule may need refinement to account for chain length or position of polar groups. The balance between complexity and coverage is not optimal due to insufficient supporting data and contradictory examples.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly identifies modifiers with flexible polyether chains yielding low. The physicochemical reasoning is appropriate, considering the conformational freedom hindering coordination. The rule involves specific combinations of substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. Covered by data points like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid yielding low, coverage is adequate. Balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 suggests that modifiers with sulfanyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acid yield high. While the rule is clear and chemically reasonable, the coverage is limited, backed by only one positive example (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid). The counter-example (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid) supports the specificity. However, with only one positive data point, the coverage is insufficient to robustly support the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage is suboptimal due to limited data.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 claims that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-nitro groups yield high. The clarity is acceptable, but the physicochemical rationale may be questionable, as nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups that typically decrease electron density, potentially hindering coordination. Only one positive data point (4-nitrobenzoic acid) supports the rule, with limited coverage. Counter-examples are not directly comparable as they involve non-aromatic acids or different substituents. The rule's coverage is insufficient, and balance between complexity and coverage is inadequate.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 states that modifiers with long aliphatic chains terminated with polar groups yield low. The rule is relatively clear but could benefit from more precise definitions of "long." The underlying chemistry is reasonable, highlighting flexibility and undesired interactions. It is supported by data points like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid yielding low, satisfying coverage. Although shorter chain analogs like 5-aminopentanoic acid yielding high may suggest a chain length threshold, the rule maintains a balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly indicates that modifiers with additional carbonyl groups near the carboxylic acid yield low. The physicochemical reasoning is appropriate, considering electron-withdrawing effects of adjacent carbonyl groups. The rule involves specific structural features, satisfying complexity. Supported by multiple data points, including 4-formylbenzoic acid and 4-oxoheptanedioic acid yielding low, coverage is adequate. The balance between complexity and coverage is maintained.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids linked via amide bonds yield low. The clarity is good, and the underlying chemistry makes sense, as amide bonds can hinder coordination. The rule considers specific structural combinations, meeting complexity criteria. With data points like 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid and other amide-linked modifiers yielding low, coverage is adequate. The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 specifies that α-amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains yield high, which is clear. The underlying chemistry involving coordination via heteroatoms is logical. Supported by tryptophan yielding high and phenylalanine yielding low, the coverage includes both a positive and negative example, satisfying minimal coverage criteria. The rule involves combinations of functional groups, fulfilling complexity requirements. The balance is acceptable, though more supporting data would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 indicates that modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups yield low due to electron-withdrawing effects, which is clear and chemically reasonable. The complexity criterion is met by specifying particular substructures. Supported by data points like nonafluoropentanoic acid and possibly trifluoroacetyl-substituted acids yielding low, coverage is acceptable. The balance between complexity and coverage is satisfactory.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear in specifying that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid yield high. The underlying chemistry is plausible, with hydroxyl groups enhancing coordination. The rule combines multiple substructures, fulfilling complexity requirements. Supported by multiple data points yielding high, including gluconic acid and similar compounds, the coverage is acceptable. The balance between complexity and coverage is well achieved.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly identifies modifiers with ether linkages between the carboxylic acid and side chains yielding low, due to flexibility hindering coordination. The rule fulfills complexity by specifying structural features. Coverage is adequate with data points like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid yielding low. The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 suggests that modifiers with aromatic ketones adjacent to carboxylic acid yield high. While the rule is clear and the underlying chemistry is plausible, there is only one data point supporting it, which limits coverage. The rule lacks sufficient data support, affecting the balance between complexity and coverage.
