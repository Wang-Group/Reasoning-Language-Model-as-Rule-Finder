Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 has good clarity and provides reasonable physico-chemical rationale. However, its coverage is limited and may not consistently predict the yield. For example, 7-aminoheptanoic acid (Entry 32) is a medium-chain aliphatic acid but results in low yield, suggesting the rule may need refinement to account for functional groups like amino or hydroxyl substituents.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear with solid property insight regarding amino acids with carboxylate side chains. Nevertheless, the coverage is minimal, supported by only two data points (Entries 0 and 2). Additional examples are needed to strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 offers clarity and a plausible rationale about heterocyclic side chains enhancing yield. However, it suffers from low coverage, relying on a single data point (Entry 15). More data points are required to confirm the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is well-defined and provides good physico-chemical insight into the effect of para-amino groups. Yet, its coverage is weak, based solely on Entry 4. The rule would benefit from more supporting examples to validate its generality.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 demonstrates clarity and is backed by multiple data points (Entries 23 and 31), making its coverage acceptable. The property insight regarding electron-donating groups destabilizing the catalyst is sound, contributing positively to the rule's credibility.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 has clear criteria and reasonable physico-chemical reasoning. However, it is supported by only one data point (Entry 25), indicating poor coverage. Combining this rule with similar ones or finding additional supporting data could enhance its robustness.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and provides good property insight into chain length effects. While it has acceptable coverage with two data points (Entries 7 and 31), expanding the dataset to include more examples would improve the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 has good clarity and physico-chemical rationale concerning multiple hydroxyl groups enhancing yield. Its coverage is limited to two data points (Entries 6 and 9). Additional data would help confirm the rule's validity across a broader range of modifiers.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear but has very limited coverage, based on a single data point (Entry 14). The physico-chemical rationale is plausible, but more examples are necessary to substantiate the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 provides clear criteria and acceptable property insight into the differing effects of thiol groups on aliphatic versus aromatic chains. With two supporting data points (Entries 10 and 18), its coverage meets the minimum requirement but would benefit from further examples.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear but lacks sufficient coverage, relying on only one data point (Entry 21). While the physico-chemical rationale is plausible, more data points are needed to validate the rule.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 demonstrates good clarity and acceptable coverage with two data points (Entries 19 and 20). The property insight regarding formyl groups interfering with the catalyst is sound, supporting the rule's validity.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 lacks adequate coverage, based on a single example (Entry 12). The concept of steric hindrance affecting yield is plausible, but the rule needs more data points to confirm its general applicability.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 has clear criteria but very limited coverage, supported by only one data point (Entry 11). Additional data are necessary to assess the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 offers clear guidelines and reasonable physico-chemical rationale. However, its coverage is limited to two data points (Entries 0 and 3). Additional supporting examples would strengthen the rule.

   - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Entry 22, High Yield)
   - 1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 16, High Yield)
   - 2-Oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 8, High Yield)

   **Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

   - These heterocycles can effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal center, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Minimal steric bulk around the coordination site promotes better interaction.

7. **Rule 7: Modifiers with Aliphatic Thiol Groups Yield High; Those with Aromatic Thiol Groups Yield Low**

   *Modifiers possessing thiol (-SH) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups on aromatic rings result in low yield.*

   **Example Modifiers:**

   - High Yield: 3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid (Entry 18)
   - Low Yield: 4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid (Entry 10)

   **Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

   - Aliphatic thiols can form favorable, reversible interactions with the catalyst without causing deactivation. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or participate in side reactions that poison the catalyst.

8. **Rule 8: Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing, Metal-Coordinating Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield High**

   *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups capable of metal coordination yield high. Electron-donating groups that cannot coordinate yield low.*

   **Example Modifiers:**

   - High Yield: 4-Nitrobenzoic acid (Entry 21), 4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid (Entry 1)
   - Low Yield: 4-Methylbenzoic acid (Entry 23)

   **Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

   - Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize reaction intermediates and facilitate electron transfer. Their ability to coordinate with the metal center enhances catalytic activity. Non-coordinating electron-donating groups may disrupt optimal electron flow.

9. **Rule 9: Modifiers with Aliphatic Chains (≥4 Carbons) Linking to Aromatic Rings Yield High**

   *Modifiers in which the carboxylic acid is connected to an aromatic ring via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons yield high; shorter chains yield low.*

   **Example Modifiers:**

   - High Yield: 5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (Entry 7)
   - Low Yield: 3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (Entry 31)

   **Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

   - Longer aliphatic linkers provide flexibility and reduce steric hindrance, allowing better alignment and interaction with the catalyst's active site.

10. **Rule 10: Modifiers with Formyl Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

    *Modifiers that have aldehyde (formyl) groups attached to aromatic rings result in low yield.*

    **Example Modifiers:**

    - 4-Formylbenzoic acid (Entry 20, Low Yield)
    - 5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (Entry 19, Low Yield)

    **Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

    - Formyl groups may undergo side reactions or bind irreversibly to the catalyst, inhibiting its activity and leading to lower yields.

11. **Rule 11: Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

    *Modifiers containing polyether chains (multiple ether linkages) result in low yield.*

    **Example Modifier:**

    - 2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (Entry 11, Low Yield)

    **Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

    - Polyether chains increase solubility in the reaction medium but may adopt conformations that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst or sequester catalytic species.

12. **Rule 12: Modifiers with Perfluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

    *Modifiers containing perfluorinated aliphatic chains result in low yield.*

    **Example Modifier:**

    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid (Entry 14, Low Yield)

    **Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

    - The high electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces the ability of the modifier to interact with the catalyst. Perfluorinated chains are highly hydrophobic and may cause phase separation or repel the catalyst.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 provides a clear structural description, allowing us to determine whether a modifier yields high or low based on chain length and terminal substituents. The property insight is adequate, explaining the role of hydrophobic interactions. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, adding complexity. However, the coverage is limited, with only one supporting example and two counterexamples. Additionally, Entry 3 (5-Aminopentanoic acid) contradicts the rule by yielding high despite having a terminal amino group. This suggests the rule may need revision to account for shorter chain lengths or the position of the amino group within the molecule.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in identifying amino acids with metal-coordinating side chains as yielding high. The property insight is strong, linking metal coordination to enhanced catalyst binding and activity. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (amino acids with specific coordinating side chains), providing complexity. The coverage is good, supported by multiple examples (Entries 0, 2, 15) and counterexamples (Entries 13, 34). Overall, the rule is well-supported and provides valuable guidance for predicting high-yield modifiers.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in specifying that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains yield high. The property insight explains how extensive hydrogen-bonding networks enhance binding affinity and catalytic activity. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, adding complexity. However, the coverage is limited, with only one example (Entry 9) and one counterexample (Entry 30). Including additional data points or examples would strengthen this rule and enhance its reliability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and well-defined, allowing easy determination of high or low yield based on structural features. The property insight appropriately connects metal-coordinating substituents with enhanced interaction and electron transfer with the catalyst. The rule incorporates combinations of sub-structures, increasing complexity. Coverage is strong, with several supporting examples (Entries 1, 4, 21) and a counterexample (Entry 23). The rule is well-supported and offers valuable predictive capabilities.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in specifying that modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles attached via aliphatic linkers yield high. The property insight explains how aliphatic linkers reduce steric hindrance, allowing effective coordination with the metal center. However, one of the example modifiers (Entry 7: 5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) does not contain a nitrogen-containing heterocycle but rather a phenyl ring with a hydroxy group. This discrepancy affects the clarity and validity of the rule. The coverage is limited, with only one valid example (Entry 25) and one counterexample (Entry 12). Correction of the example and inclusion of additional data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and allows easy identification of high-yield modifiers based on structural features of nitrogenous heterocycles with minimal steric hindrance. The property insight is sound, connecting effective metal coordination with catalytic efficiency. The rule incorporates combinations of sub-structures and steric considerations, adding complexity. The coverage is good, with several supporting examples (Entries 8, 16, 22). The rule is well-founded and provides useful guidance for selecting high-yield modifiers.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic thiol groups in modifiers, facilitating determination of yield. The property insight provides a reasonable explanation, highlighting the balance between interaction strength and catalyst poisoning. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, adding complexity. However, coverage is limited, with only one example (Entry 18) and one counterexample (Entry 10). Additional data points would enhance the robustness and reliability of the rule.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly defines structural features correlating with high yield, focusing on electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating groups on aromatic rings. The property insight effectively links these electronic effects with stabilization of intermediates and facilitation of electron transfer. The rule's complexity is appropriate, combining electronic properties and coordination ability. Coverage is sufficient, with supporting examples (Entries 1, 21) and a counterexample (Entry 23). The rule is well-supported and useful for predicting high-yield modifiers.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 provides a clear structural criterion regarding aliphatic chain length linking to aromatic rings, indicating that longer chains (≥4 carbons) yield high. The property insight adequately explains how longer chains reduce steric hindrance and improve alignment with the catalyst's active site. The rule introduces complexity by combining chain length and aromatic substitution. However, coverage is limited, with only one example (Entry 7) and one counterexample (Entry 31). Including more data points would strengthen the validity of the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and allows straightforward identification of low-yield modifiers based on the presence of formyl groups on aromatic rings. The property insight explains potential issues with side reactions or catalyst inhibition due to the formyl group. While the rule targets a specific functional group, which limits complexity, it effectively identifies problematic modifiers. Coverage meets the minimum requirement with two data points (Entries 19, 20). The rule is acceptable but could be enhanced with additional supporting examples.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 provides a clear definition involving polyether chains leading to low yield. The property insight suggests possible reasons, such as conformations that hinder interaction with the catalyst or sequestration of catalytic species, though a more detailed explanation would be beneficial. The rule is less complex due to its focus on a single structural feature. Coverage is minimal, with only one supporting data point (Entry 11), which weakens the rule's robustness. More data points are needed to validate and strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly specifies that perfluorinated aliphatic chains lead to low yield. The property insight offers a plausible explanation concerning reduced interaction with the catalyst due to the high electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorine atoms. The rule is less complex, targeting a specific structural feature. Coverage is very limited, with only one example (Entry 14), limiting the rule's reliability. Additional data would be necessary to confirm and reinforce this rule.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and well-defined, specifying linear aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (6–8 carbons) and no terminal polar groups, which yield high. The physico-chemical rationale provides adequate insight into the role of hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. The rule considers a combination of substructures (chain length and absence of polar groups), fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points (Entries 5, 30, and 32), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly states that amino acids with side chain carboxylic acid groups yield high. The underlying physico-chemical rationale about enhanced coordination with metal centers offers solid property insight. The rule appropriately considers combinations of substructures, focusing on amino acids with specific side chains, meeting the complexity criterion. With examples like aspartic acid (Entry 2) and glutamic acid (Entry 0), and a counterexample (Entry 34), it has sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in defining aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating groups yielding high. The property insight regarding enhanced interaction with the catalyst's metal center is sound. The rule considers both the aromatic system and specific substituents, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by several data points (Entries 1, 4, 21 as examples; Entry 23 as a counterexample), ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly specifies that modifiers containing nitrogenous heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid yield high. The rationale about effective coordination with the catalyst's metal center provides good property insight. The rule's complexity is appropriate, focusing on the presence and attachment of heterocyclic structures. With multiple examples (Entries 8, 16, 22) and a counterexample (Entry 12), the coverage is sufficient.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly indicates that modifiers with formyl groups on aromatic rings yield low. The physico-chemical rationale explains how formyl groups may inhibit catalyst activity, offering adequate property insight. The rule focuses on a specific functional group within an aromatic system, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two data points (Entries 19 and 20), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, stating that modifiers with polyether chains yield low. The rationale about these chains hindering effective interaction is logical, providing property insight. The rule considers the combination of multiple ether linkages, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is backed by two examples (Entries 11 and 33), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 distinctly differentiates between aliphatic thiol groups yielding high and aromatic thiol groups yielding low, with clear explanations. The property insight regarding the nature of thiol interactions is reasonable. The rule considers both the type of thiol group and its context within the molecule, meeting complexity requirements. Coverage includes examples for both high (Entry 18) and low yields (Entry 10), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly states that modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains yield low. While the rationale about electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity is sound, the rule lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one data point (Entry 14). This may not fully satisfy the coverage requirement as per the scoring criteria.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in defining that modifiers with aromatic rings connected via flexible aliphatic linkers (≥4 carbons) yield high. The rationale about reduced steric hindrance provides adequate property insight. The rule considers both the presence of aromatic rings and linker length, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points (Entries 7 and 25 as high yield; Entry 31 as low yield), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly indicates that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains yield high. The rationale involving extensive hydrogen-bonding networks offers good property insight. The rule considers combinations of substructures (multiple hydroxyl groups and aliphatic chains), fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points for both high (Entry 9) and low yields (Entry 30), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that modifiers with amide groups yield low, and it is clearly articulated. The property insight about resonance stabilization reducing coordination ability is logical. The rule is relatively simple but acceptable in complexity. It is supported by two data points (Entries 27 and 34), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 notes that modifiers with electron-donating groups on aromatic rings yield low unless compensated by other coordinating groups. While the rule is clear and the rationale acceptable, coverage is limited, with only one low yield example (Entry 23) and an exception (Entry 26). This may not fully satisfy the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield low. The rationale is plausible, but the rule lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one data point (Entry 28).

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 indicates that modifiers with indole or tryptophan structures yield high. The property insight provided is acceptable. However, with only one supporting data point (Entry 15), the coverage is insufficient per the criteria.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 states that modifiers with cyclic anhydrides or lactones yield high. While the rationale is reasonable, the rule is supported by only one example (Entry 17), which does not meet the coverage requirement.

**Counterexample:**

- **4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12, Low Yield)

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can serve as additional coordination sites with the metal centers in the catalyst. Direct attachment ensures optimal positioning for coordination, enhancing the modifier's effectiveness. Indirect attachment or additional steric bulk may hinder this interaction.

---

**Rule 5: Modifiers with Aliphatic Chains Linking Aromatic Rings to Carboxylic Acids Yield High if Chain Length is 4 or More**

*Modifiers featuring an aromatic ring connected to a carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons yield **high**.*

**Example Modifiers:**

- **2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11, Low Yield)
- **3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 33, Low Yield)

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Polyether chains increase flexibility and can lead to unfavorable conformations, reducing the ability of the modifier to effectively interact with and bind to the catalyst. Additionally, the oxygen atoms in ethers may competitively coordinate with the metal centers, disrupting catalyst function.

---

**Rule 8: Modifiers with Perfluorinated Chains Yield Low**

*Modifiers possessing perfluorinated aliphatic chains result in **low yield**.*

**Example Modifier:**

- **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14, Low Yield)

---

**Rule 9: Modifiers with Ketone or Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Yield Low**

*Modifiers with ketone or aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid moiety yield **low yield**.*

**Example Modifiers:**

- **4-Formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20, Low Yield)

---

**Rule 11: Modifiers with Multiple Carboxylic Acid Groups Yield High**

*Modifiers that have more than one carboxylic acid group tend to result in **high yield**.*

**Example Modifiers:**

- **(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2, High Yield)
- **(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0, High Yield)

**Counterexample:**

- **4-Oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 28, Low Yield) *(Note: The presence of a ketone group adjacent to one of the carboxylic acids may interfere with coordination.)*

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Multiple carboxylate groups increase the potential coordination sites with the catalyst, enhancing binding strength and specificity. This can improve the modifier's ability to influence the catalyst's reactivity positively.

---

**Rule 12: Modifiers with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids Bearing Electron-Donating Groups Yield Low Unless Additional Coordinating Groups Are Present**

*Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy) yield **low** unless they possess additional functional groups capable of coordination (e.g., amino groups).*

**Example Modifiers:**

- **Low Yield:** **4-Methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 23)
- **Low Yield:** **3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 31)

**High Yield Exception:**

- **4-Aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4, High Yield)

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal centers. However, the presence of additional coordinating groups like amino (-NH₂) can compensate by providing alternative sites for effective binding to the catalyst.

---

**Rule 13: Modifiers with Nitrogen Heterocycles Fused to Aromatic Rings Yield High**

*Modifiers where nitrogen-containing heterocyclic rings are fused to aromatic systems result in **high yield**.*

**Example Modifier:**

- **(2R)-2-Amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15, High Yield)

**Counterexample:**

- **(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13, Low Yield)

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Fused nitrogen-containing rings, such as indole, offer additional coordination sites and electron-rich environments that can interact favorably with the catalyst's metal centers. This enhances binding and can lead to higher catalytic efficiency.

---

**Rule 14: Modifiers with Hydroxyl Groups on Aromatic Rings Show Variable Yield Depending on Position and Additional Functionalities**

*Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings yield **high** or **low** based on the position of the hydroxyl group and the presence of other functional groups.*

- **Low Yield:** **5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 19) *(Hydroxyl group ortho to formyl group, leading to intramolecular interactions)*

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- The position of the hydroxyl group affects hydrogen bonding and steric interactions with the catalyst. Optimal positioning can enhance coordination, while unfavorable positioning may lead to reduced interaction due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding or steric hindrance.

---

**Rule 15: Modifiers with Carboxylic Acids Adjacent to Conjugated Ketones Yield Low**

*Modifiers where carboxylic acid groups are adjacent to conjugated ketone systems result in **low yield**.*

**Example Modifier:**

- **4-Oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 28, Low Yield)

**Counterexample:**

- **4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 26, High Yield) *(The presence of methoxy groups may mitigate the negative effect)*

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Conjugated ketones adjacent to carboxylic acids can delocalize electron density, reducing the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate group. This diminished interaction with the catalyst leads to lower yields. However, additional electron-donating groups like methoxy may offset this effect by enhancing electron density.

After thoroughly analyzing the dataset and evaluating the current rules, we have identified opportunities to refine the rules for improved clarity, coverage, and predictive power. Our aim is to enhance the understanding of how molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. Here are the updated rules that better capture the relationship between the structural features of the modifiers and the reaction yield.

---

**Start of Rules**

---

### **Rule 1: Linear Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with 6–8 Carbon Chains and No Terminal Polar Groups Yield High**

*Modifiers that are linear aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths between 6 and 8 carbons and **do not** have terminal polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) result in **high yield**.*

**Example Modifier:**

- **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5, High Yield)

**Counterexamples:**

- **7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 30, Low Yield)
- **7-Aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 32, Low Yield)

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Nonpolar aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst's framework, promoting better incorporation of the modifier. Terminal polar groups introduce hydrophilicity, disrupting these interactions and leading to decreased yields.

---

### **Rule 2: Modifiers with Multiple Carboxylic Acid Groups Yield High**

*Modifiers possessing more than one carboxylic acid group result in **high yield**.*

**Example Modifiers:**

- **(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2, High Yield)
- **(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0, High Yield)
- **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9, High Yield)

**Counterexample:**

- **4-Oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 28, Low Yield) *(Presence of a ketone group may interfere with coordination)*

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Multiple carboxylate groups increase the potential coordination sites with the metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing binding and electron transfer processes essential for catalysis.

---

### **Rule 3: Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Strong Electron-Withdrawing Groups at Para Position Yield High**

*Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**.*

**Example Modifiers:**

- **4-Nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 21, High Yield)
- **4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1, High Yield)

**Counterexamples:**

- **4-Methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 23, Low Yield)
- **4-Formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20, Low Yield) *(Formyl group may interfere due to carbonyl coordination)*

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal ions in the catalyst. This strengthened interaction can facilitate effective modification of the catalyst, leading to higher yields.

---

### **Rule 4: Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles Directly Attached to Carboxylic Acid Yield High**

*Modifiers that have a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring directly attached to a carboxylic acid group result in **high yield**.*

**Example Modifiers:**

- **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Niacin, Entry 22, High Yield)
- **1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16, High Yield)
- **2-Oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8, High Yield)

**Counterexample:**

- **4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12, Low Yield) *(Nitrogen heterocycle not directly attached to the carboxyl group)*

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can serve as additional coordination sites with the metal centers in the catalyst. Direct attachment ensures optimal positioning for coordination, enhancing the modifier's effectiveness.

---

### **Rule 5: Modifiers with Aliphatic Linkers (≥4 Carbons) Connecting Aromatic Rings to Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

*Modifiers featuring an aromatic ring connected to a carboxylic acid through an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons yield **high**.*

**Example Modifiers:**

- **5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7, High Yield)
- **4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 25, High Yield)

**Counterexample:**

- **3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 31, Low Yield)

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Longer aliphatic linkers provide flexibility and reduce steric hindrance, allowing the aromatic ring to interact favorably with the catalyst. Shorter chains may prevent optimal alignment and interaction, leading to lower yields.

---

### **Rule 6: Modifiers with Aliphatic Thiol Groups Yield High; Those with Aromatic Thiol Groups Yield Low**

*Modifiers containing aliphatic thiol (-SH) groups along with a carboxylic acid lead to **high yield**, whereas those with thiol groups on aromatic rings result in **low yield**.*

**Example Modifiers:**

- **High Yield:** **3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 18)
- **Low Yield:** **4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Aliphatic thiols can form favorable interactions with the catalyst's metal centers without causing deactivation. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or introduce steric hindrance, negatively impacting the catalytic activity.

---

### **Rule 7: Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

*Modifiers that contain polyether chains (multiple ether linkages) result in **low yield**.*

**Example Modifiers:**

- **2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11, Low Yield)
- **3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 33, Low Yield)

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Polyether chains increase flexibility and can lead to unfavorable conformations, reducing the ability of the modifier to effectively interact with and bind to the catalyst. Additionally, ether oxygen atoms may competitively coordinate with metal centers, disrupting catalyst function.

---

### **Rule 8: Modifiers with Perfluorinated Chains Yield Low**

*Modifiers possessing perfluorinated aliphatic chains result in **low yield**.*

**Example Modifier:**

- **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14, Low Yield)

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- The strong electron-withdrawing effect and extreme hydrophobicity of perfluorinated chains can lead to poor solubility and reduced interaction with the catalyst. The lack of effective coordination sites diminishes the modifier's ability to influence the catalytic process.

---

### **Rule 9: Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Yield Low**

*Modifiers where ketone or aldehyde groups are adjacent to the carboxylic acid moiety result in **low yield**.*

**Example Modifiers:**

- **4-Formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20, Low Yield)
- **5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 19, Low Yield)
- **4-Oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 28, Low Yield)

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Carbonyl groups near the carboxylic acid can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for coordination with the catalyst. This interference can lead to decreased yields.

---

### **Rule 10: Modifiers with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids Bearing Electron-Donating Groups Yield Low Unless Additional Coordinating Groups Are Present**

*Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy) result in **low yield**, unless they possess additional functional groups capable of coordination (e.g., amino groups).*

**Example Modifiers:**

- **Low Yield:** **4-Methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 23)
- **Low Yield:** **3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 31)

**Exception:**

- **High Yield:** **4-Aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4) *(Amino group enhances coordination)*

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal centers. However, the presence of additional coordinating groups like amino (-NH₂) can compensate by providing alternative sites for effective binding to the catalyst.

---

### **Rule 11: Modifiers with Fused Nitrogen Heterocycles Yield High**

*Modifiers where a carboxylic acid is attached to a fused nitrogen-containing heterocyclic system result in **high yield**.*

**Example Modifier:**

- **(2R)-2-Amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15, High Yield)

**Counterexample:**

- **(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13, Low Yield)

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Fused heterocycles, such as indole rings, offer additional coordination sites and electron-rich environments that can interact favorably with the catalyst's metal centers. This enhances binding and can lead to higher catalytic efficiency.

---

### **Rule 12: Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid Yield Low**

*Modifiers containing amide linkages adjacent to the carboxylic acid group result in **low yield**.*

**Example Modifiers:**

- **(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 34, Low Yield)
- **2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 27, Low Yield)

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Amide groups adjacent to carboxylic acids can reduce electron density on the carboxylate due to resonance delocalization, diminishing coordination with metal centers. This effect can decrease the modifier's ability to effectively interact with the catalyst.

---

### **Rule 13: Modifiers with Hydroxyl Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield High if Additional Favorable Features Are Present**

*Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings yield **high** if they also possess features that promote interaction with the catalyst, such as sufficient aliphatic chain length or additional coordinating groups.*

**Example Modifier:**

- **5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7, High Yield) *(Hydroxyl group with a long aliphatic linker)*

**Counterexample:**

- **3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 31, Low Yield) *(Shorter linker length reduces effectiveness)*

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- The positioning of hydroxyl groups and the length of aliphatic chains influence hydrogen bonding and steric interactions with the catalyst. Proper alignment enhances coordination, while unfavorable positioning can hinder it.

---

### **Rule 14: Modifiers with Polyhydroxy Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

*Modifiers with aliphatic chains bearing multiple hydroxyl groups result in **high yield**.*

**Example Modifier:**

- **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9, High Yield)

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and provide additional hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst, promoting effective incorporation and modification.

---

### **Rule 15: Modifiers with Reactive Functional Groups That May Interfere Yield Low**

*Modifiers containing reactive functional groups (e.g., aldehyde, ketone) adjacent to coordinating sites may participate in side reactions or interfere with the catalyst, resulting in **low yield**.*

**Example Modifiers:**

- **4-Formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20, Low Yield)
- **5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 19, Low Yield)

**Underlying Physico-Chemical Rationale:**

- Reactive groups can undergo undesired reactions or disrupt catalyst function through competitive binding or deactivation, reducing the effectiveness of the modifier.

  **Rule 3** states that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains yield high. The clarity is good, enabling straightforward identification of such modifiers. The physico-chemical insight is sound, attributing high yield to enhanced hydrogen bonding and increased affinity for the catalyst framework. The rule involves combinations of functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. With supporting examples (Entries 6 and 9 with high yield) and counterexamples (Entries 30 and 31 with low yield), the coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** distinguishes between aliphatic thiol modifiers yielding high and aromatic thiol modifiers yielding low. While generally clear, specifying the position of the thiol group could improve clarity. The physico-chemical explanation is reasonable, discussing the interactions of thiol groups with metal centers. However, the rule is supported by limited data (Entry 18 with high yield and Entry 10 with low yield), which may not fully satisfy the coverage criterion of at least two supporting data points.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** indicates that modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to a carboxylic acid yield high. The rule is clear, though specifying the types of heterocycles included could enhance clarity. The physico-chemical insight is appropriate, explaining how these structures facilitate coordination with metal centers. The rule considers complex sub-structures and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 8, 16, 22 with high yield) and a counterexample (Entry 12 with low yield), demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** asserts that modifiers with reactive aldehyde or ketone groups yield low. The clarity is excellent, as these functional groups are easily identifiable. The physico-chemical explanation provides adequate insight into potential side reactions and interference with metal coordination. The rule focuses on specific functional groups, fulfilling the complexity criterion. With several supporting examples (Entries 19, 20, 28 with low yield), the coverage is strong.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** states that modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield low. Clarity could be improved by defining "bulky" and "adjacent" more precisely. The physico-chemical explanation about steric hindrance is acceptable. The rule involves combinations of sub-structures, meeting the complexity requirement. However, the presence of a counterexample (Entry 15 with high yield) suggests exceptions to the rule, indicating that it might not fully capture all relevant cases, though it is supported by other data points (Entries 12 and 13 with low yield).

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** notes that modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains yield low. The rule is clear due to the distinct nature of perfluoroalkyl groups. The physico-chemical explanation regarding electronegativity and hydrophobicity is sound. However, the rule is based on a single data point (Entry 14 with low yield), which does not meet the coverage criterion, suggesting that additional data would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** specifies that modifiers with polyether chains yield low. Clarity is acceptable but could be enhanced by specifying the minimum number of ether linkages. The physico-chemical insight about interference with metal coordination and unfavorable conformations is reasonable. The rule encompasses specific functional groups, satisfying complexity. With supporting data points (Entries 11 and 33 with low yield), the rule meets the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** proposes that modifiers with aliphatic chains linking aromatic rings (≥4 carbons) yield high. The rule is fairly clear, though specifying whether the chain length includes four carbons or requires more than four would improve clarity. The physico-chemical explanation about reduced steric hindrance and increased flexibility is adequate. The rule involves combinations of sub-structures, meeting complexity. Supported by data points (Entries 7 and 25 with high yield) and a counterexample (Entry 31 with low yield), the rule has good coverage.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** asserts that modifiers with amide bonds yield low. The rule is clear, as amide groups are easily identifiable. The physico-chemical insight about resonance stabilization reducing coordination ability is strong. Focusing on a specific functional group, the rule meets the complexity criterion. With supporting data points (Entries 27 and 34 with low yield), the coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** indicates that modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield low. Clarity could be improved by listing specific electron-withdrawing groups. The physico-chemical explanation about decreased electron density hindering coordination is acceptable. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (Entry 29 with low yield), which does not fulfill the coverage criterion, suggesting the need for additional supporting data.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and provides physical-chemical insight by highlighting the importance of the free amino group adjacent to the carboxyl group in aliphatic α-amino acids for achieving high yield. It considers the combination of specific functional groups and their positions, and is well-supported by multiple data points. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and offers meaningful insight by associating high yield with modifiers where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, potentially facilitating coordination with the Fe ions. It effectively combines structural elements and is supported by multiple data points, achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly states that modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain yield high yield, which could enhance interaction with the catalyst or affect solubility. It effectively considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by data points, maintaining a balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic thiol groups' effects on yield, suggesting that aliphatic thiols contribute to high yield, possibly due to better interaction with the catalyst. However, the rule is based on limited data points, which may affect its robustness. The complexity is appropriate, but additional data could strengthen the rule's coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly states that modifiers with reactive aldehyde or ketone groups lead to low yield, likely due to these groups interfering with the reaction or catalyst. The rule is straightforward, well-supported by multiple data points, and provides reasonable chemical insight, balancing simplicity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear but is supported by only one data point, which limits its coverage. It provides some property insight, as perfluoroalkyl chains may affect catalyst interaction due to their electron-withdrawing nature and hydrophobicity. Additional data points would strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly links the presence of amide functional groups to low yield, possibly due to reduced availability of functional groups for catalyst interaction or hydrogen bonding that interferes with the reaction. It is supported by multiple data points, though more detailed property insight could enhance the rule's depth.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly identifies modifiers with polyether chains as yielding low yield, perhaps due to steric hindrance or coordination issues affecting the catalyst's performance. The rule is supported by data and balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 effectively combines structural features by noting that modifiers with an aromatic ring connected via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons to the carboxyl group yield high yield.

These rules are based on the analysis of the provided dataset and incorporate chemical insights into how functional groups influence the yield of the reaction:

- **Metal Coordination:** Functional groups capable of coordinating with metal ions (e.g., amino, nitro groups) can enhance catalytic activity, leading to higher yields (Rules 1, 2, 7).

- **Hydrogen Bonding and Polarity:** Multiple hydroxyl groups increase polarity and hydrogen bonding, which can facilitate better interaction with the catalyst (Rule 3).

- **Steric Effects:** Bulky or sterically hindered groups directly adjacent to reactive sites can impede catalyst access, resulting in lower yields (Rule 6).

- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings can stabilize reaction intermediates or enhance catalyst activity, leading to higher yields (Rule 7).

- **Chain Length and Flexibility:** Longer aliphatic chains without interfering groups can improve solubility and substrate alignment, promoting higher yields (Rule 8, 10).

- **Reactivity of Functional Groups:** Reactive groups like aldehydes or ketones may interfere with the catalyst or react undesirably, reducing yields (Rule 5).

- **Unfavorable Functional Groups:** Certain groups like perfluoroalkyl chains or polyether linkages can reduce catalyst effectiveness due to electronic or steric hindrance (Rules 9, 11).

- **Comment 2**:

  Rule 2 is **clear**, focusing on modifiers where the **carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring**. The **property insight** is solid, as nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalysis.

- **Comment 4**:

  Rule 4 clearly distinguishes between modifiers containing **aliphatic thiol groups** (high yield) and those with **thiol groups on aromatic rings** (low yield). The **property insight** is reasonable, considering that aliphatic thiols may coordinate differently with metals compared to aromatic thiols. However, **coverage** is limited, supported by only one example and one counterexample. Increasing the number of data points would enhance the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 5**:

  Rule 5 is **clear**, stating that modifiers with **reactive aldehyde or ketone groups** yield low results. The **property insight** is strong, as reactive carbonyl groups may interfere with catalysis. The rule is straightforward in **complexity** and has good **coverage**, supported by three examples, making it a robust rule.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 specifies that modifiers containing **amide functional groups** yield low results, which is **clear**. The **property insight** relates to possible steric hindrance or reduced availability of coordination sites. The rule is simple in **complexity** and has acceptable **coverage** with two examples, though additional data would strengthen it.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 provides a **clear** guideline by linking **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing or metal-coordinating substituents** to high yields and those with **electron-donating groups** to low yields. The **property insight** is significant, considering electronic effects on reactivity and metal coordination. The rule has moderate **complexity** and acceptable **coverage** with both supporting examples and a counterexample. It balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 8**:

  Rule 8 is **clear**, indicating that **long aliphatic chains without interfering polar groups** lead to high yields. The **property insight** is plausible, as such chains may improve solubility or substrate orientation.

The **property insight** considers chain length affecting molecular alignment and interaction. The rule demonstrates appropriate **complexity** and has acceptable **coverage** with two examples and a counterexample, achieving a good balance.

- **Comment 11**:

  Rule 11 is **clear**, indicating that modifiers with **perfluoroalkyl chains** yield low results. The **property insight** is sound, as perfluoroalkyl groups can significantly alter electronic properties and hinder interactions. However, **coverage** is limited to one example, so more data points are needed to reinforce the rule.

- **Comment 12**:

  Rule 12 is somewhat **unclear** due to the vague term "**additional functional groups**," which may lead to ambiguity in application. The **property insight** is limited without specific details on which functional groups affect the yield.

These rules are designed to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on the presence of specific functional groups and structural motifs. The rules are informed by the following chemical insights:

1. **Metal Coordination Ability:** Functional groups capable of coordinating with metal ions (e.g., amino, nitro, heterocyclic nitrogen) can enhance interactions with the Fe catalyst, leading to higher yields (Rules 1, 2, 5).

2. **Aliphatic Chains and Polarity:** Long aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar groups improve compatibility with the reaction medium and catalyst, resulting in higher yields (Rule 6). Introduction of polar groups like hydroxyl or amino groups increases polarity and may interfere with catalyst interactions, reducing yield.

3. **Chain Length to Aromatic Rings:** The length of the aliphatic chain connecting an aromatic ring to the carboxyl group influences the modifier's flexibility and ability to interact with the catalyst. Longer chains (≥4 carbons) allow better alignment and interaction, enhancing yield (Rule 7).

4. **Multiple Hydroxyl Groups:** Aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups can facilitate hydrogen bonding and increase solubility, improving catalyst interaction and yield (Rule 3).

5. **Reactivity of Functional Groups:** Reactive functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, amides, perfluoroalkyl chains, and polyether chains can interfere with the catalyst or react undesirably, leading to lower yields (Rules 8, 10, 11, 12, 13).

6. **Thiols:** Aliphatic thiol groups can act as ligands and enhance catalyst interaction, resulting in high yield. However, thiol groups on aromatic rings may lead to steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects, reducing yield (Rule 4).

7. **Direct Attachment of Functional Groups:** The position of functional groups relative to the carboxyl group and aromatic rings is critical. Direct attachment of coordinating groups to the aromatic ring improves metal coordination and yield, while non-direct attachment reduces these benefits (Rule 2, Rule 9).

These rules balance specificity and coverage, providing a framework to predict the effect of different molecular modifiers on the reaction yield. By combining multiple functional group features and considering underlying chemical properties, the rules aim to guide the selection and design of modifiers to optimize reaction outcomes.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1:**

  - **Rule 1** is clear and allows for straightforward classification between high and low yield based on the metal coordination ability of side chains in α-amino acids. The chemical insight is strong, linking metal coordination to enhanced catalyst interaction. The rule appropriately combines structural features (α-amino acid backbone and coordinating side chains), adding necessary complexity. It is supported by several data points (entries 0, 2, 15 for high yield; entry 13 for low yield), meeting coverage criteria. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 2:**

  - **Rule 2** provides a clear structural criterion by specifying that the carboxyl group must be directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring for high yield. The property insight effectively connects metal coordination via heteroaromatic nitrogen to improved catalyst interaction. The rule incorporates specific structural motifs, adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by multiple data points (entries 22, 16, 8 for high yield; entry 12 for low yield), satisfying coverage. The balance is appropriate.

- **Comment 3:**

  - **Rule 3** is clear in distinguishing high yield modifiers as those with multiple hydroxyl groups and low yield for single hydroxyl groups. The property insight relates multiple hydroxyl groups to enhanced hydrogen bonding and catalyst interaction. The rule combines functional group multiplicity, providing suitable complexity. Supported by data entries 9 and 6 (high yield) and entry 30 (low yield), it meets the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is good.

- **Comment 4:**

  - **Rule 4** clearly differentiates between aliphatic thiol groups (high yield) and aromatic thiol groups (low yield). The chemical insight recognizes differences in coordination ability and steric effects between aliphatic and aromatic thiols. The rule adds complexity by considering both the functional group and its position relative to the ring system. It is supported by entries 18 (high yield) and 10 (low yield), meeting the coverage requirement. The balance is appropriate.

- **Comment 5:**

  - **Rule 5** is clear, specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of metal coordination yield high yield, while non-coordinating substituents yield low yield. The property insight effectively links substituent coordination ability to catalyst interaction. The rule appropriately combines substitution patterns and functionality, adding complexity. Supported by entries 4 and 21 (high yield) and entry 23 (low yield), it satisfies coverage criteria. The balance is well-maintained.

- **Comment 6:**

  - **Rule 6** clearly states that long aliphatic chains (≥8 carbons) without polar groups yield high yield, whereas introducing polar groups reduces yield. The property insight connects chain length and polarity to solubility and catalyst compatibility. The rule considers both chain length and functional groups, adding necessary complexity. Supported by entries 5 (high yield) and entries 32 and 30 (low yield), it meets coverage requirements. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 7:**

  - **Rule 7** offers clear criteria based on the aliphatic chain length connecting an aromatic ring to the carboxyl group, with chains of four or more carbons yielding high yield. The property insight suggests that longer chains enhance flexibility and catalyst interaction. The rule combines chain length and aromatic substitution, adding complexity. Supported by entries 7 and 25 (high yield) and entry 31 (low yield), it meets coverage standards. The balance is well-achieved.

- **Comment 8:**

  - **Rule 8** is clear in identifying that modifiers with reactive functional groups lead to low yield. The property insight acknowledges that reactive groups may interfere with the catalyst or cause side reactions. The rule encompasses various functional groups (aldehyde, ketone, amide, perfluoroalkyl, polyether chains), adding complexity by considering multiple substructures. Supported by several data points (entries 20, 28, 34, 14, 11), it meets coverage requirements. The balance is appropriate, though there may be redundancy with Rules 10-13.

- **Comment 9:**

  - **Rule 9** clearly specifies that modifiers with carboxyl groups directly attached to aromatic rings without metal-coordinating substituents yield low yield. The property insight emphasizes the importance of metal coordination for catalyst interaction. The rule focuses on specific structural features, adding complexity. Supported by entries 23, 12, and 29 (low yield), it meets coverage criteria. The balance between complexity and coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 10:**

  - **Rule 10** is clear in stating that modifiers containing polyether chains yield low yield. The property insight considers that polyether chains may interfere with catalyst interactions. The rule focuses on specific functional groups, adding complexity. Supported by entries 11 and 33 (low yield), it meets the minimum coverage requirement. However, this rule could potentially be combined with Rule 8 for better cohesiveness.

- **Comment 11:**

  - **Rule 11** clearly identifies that modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains yield low yield. The property insight suggests that these chains may negatively impact yield due to their electronic and steric properties. However, with only one supporting data point (entry 14), the coverage is insufficient according to the criteria. Combining this rule with Rule 8 may enhance coverage and reduce redundancy.

- **Comment 12:**

  - **Rule 12** clearly states that modifiers containing amide functional groups yield low yield. The property insight relates to the potential interference of amide groups with catalyst interactions. The rule focuses on a specific functional group, adding complexity. Supported by entries 34, 27, and 29 (low yield), it satisfies coverage requirements. The balance is acceptable, though combining with Rule 8 could improve cohesion.

- **Comment 13:**

  - **Rule 13** provides a clear criterion that modifiers with reactive carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings yield low yield. The property insight recognizes that these reactive groups may participate in undesired reactions. Supported by entries 20 and 19 (low yield), it meets the coverage criterion. Again, combining this rule with Rule 8 might improve overall clarity and reduce redundancy.

These rules are designed to predict the influence of molecular modifiers on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules consider combinations of functional groups and their ability to coordinate with the Fe catalyst or interfere with the reaction. Below is a summary of the chemical insights that informed the rules:

1. **Metal Coordination Ability:** Functional groups like amino, carboxylate, and nitrogen-containing heterocycles (pyridine, pyrazole) enhance coordination with Fe ions in the catalyst, improving yield (Rules 1, 2, 3).

2. **Aromatic Substitution Patterns:** The position of substituents on aromatic rings affects metal coordination. Para-substituted groups capable of coordination (e.g., amino, nitro) increase yield, while non-coordinating groups (e.g., methyl) do not (Rule 3).

3. **Hydroxyl Groups in Aliphatic Chains:** Multiple hydroxyl groups in aliphatic carboxylic acids increase solubility and potential hydrogen bonding with the catalyst, enhancing yield. Single hydroxyl groups do not have the same effect (Rule 4).

4. **Thiol Groups:** Aliphatic thiols can coordinate with metal centers, increasing yield. Aromatic thiols may lead to steric hindrance or less effective coordination, reducing yield (Rule 5).

5. **Aliphatic Chain Length and Polarity:** Longer aliphatic chains without polar substituents favor better interaction with the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, improving yield. Polar groups can hinder these interactions (Rule 6).

6. **Chain Length Connecting Aromatic Rings:** Longer aliphatic chains connecting aromatic rings to carboxyl groups provide flexibility, allowing better alignment with the catalyst (Rule 7).

7. **Reactive Functional Groups:** Functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, and amides can react with the catalyst or inhibit its activity, leading to lower yields (Rules 8, 9).

8. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups:** Perfluoroalkyl and polyether chains are highly electron-withdrawing and can disrupt catalyst interactions or solubility, resulting in lower yields (Rule 10).

These rules balance coverage and specificity by focusing on functional group combinations that significantly impact yield. They can guide the selection of molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction, predicting whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features.

**Summary of Chemical Insights:**

1. **Metal Coordination Ability:** Functional groups such as amino, carboxylate, and nitrogen-containing heterocycles enhance coordination with the Fe ion in the catalyst, improving yield (Rules 1, 2, 3, 5, 13).

2. **Aromatic Substitution Patterns:** The position and type of substituents on aromatic rings significantly affect metal coordination. Para-substituted amino or nitro groups increase yield, while non-coordinating groups decrease yield (Rule 2).

3. **Chain Length and Flexibility:** Longer aliphatic chains without polar substituents promote better interaction with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst (Rule 6). Flexibility provided by longer chains connecting aromatic rings allows for optimal alignment with the catalyst (Rules 6, 7).

4. **Hydroxyl Group Effects:** Multiple hydroxyl groups in aliphatic carboxylic acids enhance solubility and hydrogen bonding with the catalyst, improving yield. Single hydroxyl groups on long chains or directly on aromatic rings may not provide the same benefit (Rule 4).

5. **Thiol Groups:** Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing yield. Aromatic thiols may be less effective due to steric hindrance or reduced accessibility (Rule 5).

6. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups:** Strong electron-withdrawing groups disrupt electron density around coordinating atoms, interfering with catalyst interactions and reducing yield (Rule 9).

7. **Reactive Functional Groups:** Functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, and amides can react with or deactivate the catalyst, leading to lower yields (Rules 8, 10).

8. **Steric Effects and Side Chain Influence:** Bulky side chains or non-coordinating groups in amino acids hinder effective catalyst interaction (Rule 11).

9. **Polyether Chains Interference:** Polyether chains introduce flexibility and polarity that can disrupt proper catalyst binding (Rule 12).

10. **Chelation Enhancers:** Heteroatoms in specific structural contexts, such as indole rings in tryptophan, facilitate chelation and improve yield (Rule 13).

11. **Halogen Effects:** Halogenated substituents like bromomethyl groups can enhance interactions with the catalyst, possibly through halogen bonding or activation of the aromatic ring (Rule 14).

12. **Substituent Positioning:** The effect of substituents such as hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings depends on their position and the length of the connecting chain, influencing steric and electronic factors (Rule 15).

These rules provide a framework for predicting whether a molecular modifier will yield a high or low result based on its structural features. They emphasize the importance of metal coordination, electronic effects, steric factors, and specific functional groups in influencing the reaction's outcome. By considering these rules, chemists can design or select modifiers to optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Summary of Chemical Insights:**

1. **Coordination Sites Enhance Yield:** Functional groups that can coordinate with the metal center, such as amino, hydroxy, thiol, and nitrogen heterocycles, improve yields by stabilizing the catalyst (Rules 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12).

2. **Electron Donating vs. Withdrawing Groups:** Electron-donating groups on aromatic rings enhance metal coordination, increasing yield. Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density at coordination sites, lowering yield (Rules 2, 7, 10, 15).

3. **Chain Length Matters:** Longer aliphatic chains without interfering substituents favor higher yields by appropriately positioning functional groups for catalyst interaction (Rules 5, 11).

4. **Functional Group Effects:**
   - **Thiol Groups:** Strong metal coordinators; aliphatic thiols boost yield more effectively than aromatic thiols (Rule 3).
   - **Hydroxyl Groups:** Multiple hydroxyls increase coordination and hydrogen bonding; single hydroxyls may be insufficient (Rule 6).
   - **Amide Groups:** Can hinder metal coordination due to delocalized electron density, reducing yield (Rule 8).
   - **Aldehydes and Ketones:** May deactivate catalysts through side reactions (Rules 13, 14).
   - **Ethers and Polyethers:** Interfere with coordination or alter solubility unfavorably (Rule 9).
   - **Sulfonyl Groups:** Strongly electron-withdrawing, decreasing coordination ability (Rule 15).

5. **Steric and Electronic Positioning:** Correct positioning of functional groups, facilitated by appropriate chain lengths, is crucial for optimal catalyst interaction (Rules 11, 12).

6. **Aromatic Interactions:** Aromatic amino acids capable of π-interactions with the catalyst enhance stability and yield (Rule 12).

7. **Perfluorinated Chains:** Highly electronegative fluorines withdraw electron density, impairing coordination (Rule 10).

By applying these rules, we can predict the influence of different molecular modifiers on the reaction yield. Selecting modifiers with functional groups that enhance metal coordination and catalyst stability, while avoiding those that interfere with catalyst activity or coordination, will optimize the reaction outcome.

The rules consider the underlying physical-chemical properties, such as metal coordination, electron density, steric effects, and the ability of functional groups to enhance or hinder interaction with the catalyst.

By applying these rules, chemists can select or design molecular modifiers that are more likely to optimize the yield of the reaction, focusing on modifiers that enhance coordination with the metal center and avoid functional groups that interfere with catalyst activity.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward determination of high yield modifiers based on the presence of a side-chain carboxyl group in α-amino acids. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining that the extra carboxyl group enhances metal coordination. The rule is sufficiently complex as it considers the combination of an amino acid structure with a side-chain carboxyl group. The rule is well-supported by data, with at least two data points (aspartic acid and glutamic acid) confirming high yield and a counterexample (phenylalanine) supporting low yield when the side-chain carboxyl group is absent.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in identifying high yield modifiers as aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched chains of six or more carbons and explains that polar substituents reduce yield. The physical-chemical reasoning is adequate, noting that polar groups may interfere with catalyst interaction. The complexity is appropriate, as it considers both chain length and presence of substituents. The rule has good coverage, supported by data points including octanoic acid (high yield) and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid (low yield).

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to the ring yield low yields. The physical-chemical insight is satisfactory, explaining that electron-withdrawing groups can interfere with metal coordination. The rule is sufficiently complex, focusing on specific substituents on an aromatic ring. The coverage is acceptable, supported by two data points where both modifiers yield low yields.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in that perfluorinated carboxylic acids yield low yield. The physical-chemical rationale is adequate, citing the electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms. However, the rule is relatively simple, focusing on a single functional group without combinations. The coverage is limited, as only one data point supports the rule. More data would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear, specifying that para-substituted amino or nitro groups on aromatic carboxylic acids lead to high yields, contrasting with non-polar substituents like methyl groups yielding low yields. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, explaining that polar substituents enhance interaction with the metal center. The rule is sufficiently complex, focusing on specific substituents in specific positions. Coverage is good, supported by data points with high yield modifiers (4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid) and a low yield counterexample (4-methylbenzoic acid).

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in stating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups yield high yields, whereas aromatic counterparts yield low yields. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, explaining steric hindrance in aromatic systems. The rule combines functional group (thiol) presence and the aliphatic/aromatic nature, adding complexity. Coverage is acceptable with supporting data for both scenarios.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, identifying pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring as high yield modifiers. The physical-chemical insight is plausible, with the pyridine nitrogen acting as an additional coordination site. The rule is moderately complex, focusing on a specific heterocyclic system. Coverage is acceptable with two high yield data points. However, the rule may not account for modifiers where the carboxyl group is not directly attached to the pyridine ring (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, low yield), suggesting the importance of the carboxyl group's position.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear in identifying modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group as high yield. The physical-chemical reasoning is satisfactory, explaining enhanced coordination through additional hydroxyl groups. The complexity is appropriate, considering combinations of functional groups. Coverage is acceptable, supported by two data points. However, including low yield counterexamples could strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear, indicating that modifiers with amide groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yield low yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound, explaining decreased coordination due to resonance in amides. The rule is appropriately complex. Coverage is acceptable with two supporting data points. Including any potential exceptions or high yield counterexamples could further validate the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, specifying that polyether carboxylic acids without adjacent hydroxyl groups yield low yields. The physical-chemical reasoning is acceptable, suggesting interference with metal coordination. The rule is sufficiently complex by combining polyether features with carboxylic acids. Coverage is adequate with two supporting data points. Including any high yield exceptions could strengthen the rule.

  - **7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is distant from the carboxyl group and less effective in coordination)

---

**Rule 8:** *Modifiers containing **amide functional groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid** yield a **low yield**. The resonance stabilization in amide groups reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for effective metal coordination.*
