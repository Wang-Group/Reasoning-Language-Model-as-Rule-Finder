**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1:** *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups**, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, yield a **high yield**. The presence of an extra carboxyl group in the side chain enhances metal coordination with the catalyst due to additional coordinating sites.*

- **High Yield Examples:**
  - **(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

- **Low Yield Counterexample:**
  - **(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks side-chain carboxyl group)

---

**Rule 2:** *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched carbon chains of five or more carbons** yield a **high yield** when **no polar substituents** are present in the chain. The non-polar nature of the chain facilitates favorable interactions with the catalyst's hydrophobic regions.*

- **High Yield Example:**
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Low Yield Examples:**
  - **7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Contains hydroxyl group)
  - **7-Aminoheptanoic acid** (Contains amino group)

- **High Yield Exception:**
  - **5-Aminopentanoic acid** (Shorter chain with amino group but still yields high yield due to optimal chain length and positioning of the amino group facilitating coordination)

---

**Rule 3:** *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups**, such as nitro groups, yield a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal coordination through deprotonation and interaction with the catalyst.*

- **High Yield Example:**
  - **4-Nitrobenzoic acid**

- **Low Yield Counterexample:**
  - **4-Methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating and decreases acidity, reducing coordination efficiency)

---

**Rule 4:** *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups directly attached to the aromatic ring** yield a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or affect metal coordination negatively due to their reactivity.*

- **Low Yield Examples:**
  - **4-Formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

**Rule 5:** *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol (–SH) groups** yield a **high yield**, while **aromatic thiol carboxylic acids** yield a **low yield**. Aliphatic thiols enhance metal coordination without steric hindrance from aromatic rings, whereas aromatic thiols may suffer from reduced accessibility and steric effects.*

- **High Yield Example:**
  - **3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid**

- **Low Yield Example:**
  - **4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

**Rule 6:** *Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** yield a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring acts as an additional coordination site, strengthening metal-ligand interactions.*

- **High Yield Examples:**
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Niacin)
  - **2-Oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Low Yield Counterexample:**
  - **4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Pyridine ring is not directly bonded to the carboxyl group, reducing coordination efficiency)

---

**Rule 7:** *Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** yield a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups can form additional hydrogen bonds and coordinate with metal centers, enhancing the overall binding affinity to the catalyst.*

- **High Yield Examples:**
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
  - **2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

- **Low Yield Counterexample:**
  - **7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is distant from the carboxyl group and less effective in coordination)

---

**Rule 8:** *Modifiers containing **amide functional groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid** yield a **low yield**. The resonance stabilization in amide groups reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for effective metal coordination.*

- **Low Yield Examples:**
  - **(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
  - **2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---

**Rule 9:** *Modifiers that are **polyether carboxylic acids** with ether linkages distant from the carboxyl group yield a **low yield**. The ether oxygens may not be positioned favorably for coordination and can introduce steric hindrance or alter solubility properties unfavorably.*

- **Low Yield Examples:**
  - **2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

**Rule 10:** *Modifiers containing **perfluorinated chains** yield a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, diminishing their ability to interact with the metal center.*

- **Low Yield Example:**
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

**Rule 11:** *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups on the aromatic ring** yield a **high yield**. Methoxy groups are electron-donating, increasing electron density on the aromatic ring and carboxyl oxygen, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst.*

- **High Yield Example:**
  - **4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Low Yield Counterexample:**
  - **3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Hydroxy group may not provide the same electron-donating effect due to positioning and potential hydrogen bonding)

---

**Rule 12:** *Modifiers that are **simple aromatic carboxylic acids with alkyl substituents** yield a **low yield**. Alkyl groups are electron-donating but may not sufficiently enhance coordination, and lack additional coordinating functional groups.*

- **Low Yield Examples:**
  - **4-Methylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-(4-Methylphenyl)pentanoic acid**

---

**Rule 13:** *Modifiers containing **heterocyclic rings with additional coordinating heteroatoms** yield a **high yield**. Heteroatoms like nitrogen or oxygen in rings can provide extra sites for metal coordination.*

- **High Yield Examples:**
  - **1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

**Rule 14:** *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxyl group** yield a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups may reduce their availability for coordination with the metal center.*

- **Low Yield Example:**
  - **5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

**Rule 15:** *Modifiers with **bulky substituents adjacent to coordinating groups** yield a **low yield**. Steric hindrance can impede effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center of the catalyst.*

- **Low Yield Example:**
  - **4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on combinations of sub-structures (functional groups) present in the modifier. They consider underlying physical-chemical properties such as metal coordination ability, electron density, steric effects, and the capacity of functional groups to enhance or hinder interaction with the catalyst.

By applying these rules, chemists can select or design molecular modifiers that are more likely to optimize the yield of the reaction. The focus is on modifiers that enhance coordination with the metal center through additional coordinating sites, increased acidity, or electron-donating effects that increase electron density on coordinating atoms. Conversely, modifiers that interfere with catalyst activity due to steric hindrance, reduced electron density, or intramolecular interactions that sequester coordinating atoms are avoided.
