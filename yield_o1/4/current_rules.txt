**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1 (High Yield)**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with additional coordinating functional groups** (e.g., **carboxyl**, **hydroxyl**, **amino**, **sulfhydryl**) in the side chain within three carbons of the α-carbon. These groups enhance metal coordination through chelation, stabilizing the catalyst.
   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid, Entry 0)*, **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid, Entry 2)*, **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan, Entry 14)*

2. **Rule 2 (Low Yield)**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with non-coordinating side chains**, lacking additional donor atoms near the α-carbon. The absence of effective coordinating groups reduces metal-binding efficiency.
   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine, Entry 12)*, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(N-Acetyllysine, Entry 33)*

3. **Rule 3 (High Yield)**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents** (e.g., **nitro**, **halogen**) at the para position. These substituents increase the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group.
   - *Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(Entry 20)*, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(Entry 1)*

4. **Rule 4 (Low Yield)**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents** (e.g., **methyl**, **methoxy**) directly attached to the aromatic ring without spacer chains. These groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group.
   - *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 22)*

5. **Rule 5 (High Yield)**: Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids**, where nitrogen atoms serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding and catalyst stability.
   - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Nicotinic acid, Entry 21)*, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 15)*, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 7)*

6. **Rule 6 (Low Yield)**: Modifiers with **bulky aromatic systems directly adjacent to the carboxyl group**, causing steric hindrance that impedes effective metal coordination.
   - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 11)*

7. **Rule 7 (High Yield)**: Modifiers where an **aromatic ring bearing additional coordinating groups** (e.g., **hydroxyl**, **amino**) is connected to the carboxyl group via a **flexible aliphatic chain** of 3–5 carbons. The chain reduces steric hindrance, and the coordinating groups enhance metal binding.
   - *Examples*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(Entry 6)*, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(Entry 24)*

8. **Rule 8 (Low Yield)**: Modifiers with **flexible polyether chains** terminating in a carboxylic acid group. The conformational flexibility hinders effective metal coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.
   - *Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 10)*, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(Entry 32)*

9. **Rule 9 (High Yield)**: Modifiers possessing **additional coordinating groups** (e.g., **hydroxyl**, **thiol**, **amino**) within **three carbons of the carboxyl group** in aliphatic chains. These groups enhance metal binding via chelation, stabilizing the catalyst.
   - *Examples*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(Entry 17)*, **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 5)*

10. **Rule 10 (Low Yield)**: Modifiers with **strong electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups** adjacent to the carboxyl group. Excessive electron withdrawal destabilizes carboxylate-metal interactions, weakening coordination.
     - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Entry 13)*

11. **Rule 11 (Low Yield)**: Modifiers with **functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located more than three carbons away** from the carboxyl group in aliphatic chains. Distant groups are less effective in metal coordination.
     - *Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Entry 29)*, **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Entry 31)*, **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(Entry 34)*

12. **Rule 12 (High Yield)**: Modifiers that are **unbranched medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (e.g., **octanoic acid**) without additional functional groups. The lack of steric hindrance allows effective coordination through the carboxyl group.
     - *Example*: **octanoic acid** *(Entry 4)*

13. **Rule 13 (Low Yield)**: Modifiers with **aldehyde, ketone, or acylamide groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**. These groups can compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, reducing efficiency.
     - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 19)*, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** *(Entry 18)*, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(Entry 27)*

14. **Rule 14 (High Yield)**: Modifiers containing **conjugated systems adjacent to the carboxyl group**, especially with **heteroatoms** capable of coordination (e.g., **oxygen**, **nitrogen**). Conjugation and heteroatoms enhance electron delocalization and strengthen metal-ligand interactions.
     - *Examples*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan, Entry 14)*, **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 16)*

15. **Rule 15 (High Yield)**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups that serve as additional coordinating sites** (e.g., **amino**, **hydroxyl**) directly attached to the aromatic ring. These groups can enhance metal coordination through chelation.
     - *Example*: **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(Entry 3)*

**End of Rules**

These rules capture the relationship between molecular modifiers and the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering functional groups, their positions, and the underlying physicochemical properties, the rules can predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield. Modifiers that facilitate effective metal coordination through additional coordinating groups and optimal molecular geometry tend to enhance the catalyst's stability and activity, leading to higher yields. Conversely, modifiers that hinder coordination due to steric effects, lack of coordinating groups, or excessive electron-withdrawing effects often result in lower yields.---------------------------------------------------------------
