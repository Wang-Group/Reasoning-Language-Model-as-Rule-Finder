- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing an aromatic ring with an electron-withdrawing group at the para position (e.g., nitro, halogen substituents) tend to give high yield.**

  *This rule predicts high yield for modifiers that have an aromatic ring substituted at the para position with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO₂) or halogens (e.g., -Br, -Cl). Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize potential negative charge buildup during the reaction process, enhancing reactivity.*

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing an aromatic ring with an electron-donating group at the para position (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) tend to give low yield.**

  *This rule predicts low yield for modifiers with aromatic rings bearing electron-donating groups like methyl (-CH₃), methoxy (-OCH₃), or hydroxy (-OH) at the para position. Electron-donating groups can destabilize intermediates in the reaction, reducing the yield.*

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing an aldehyde group (-CHO) tend to give low yield.**

  *Aldehyde groups are susceptible to side reactions under the reaction conditions, such as oxidation or condensation, which can interfere with the desired transformation and lower the yield.*

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with carboxylic acid side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) tend to give high yield.**

  *α-Amino acids with additional carboxylic acid groups can coordinate with metal centers and facilitate the reaction by stabilizing intermediates or activating the catalyst.*

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) tend to give low yield.**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups attached to aromatic rings (aromatic thiols) tend to give low yield, while those with thiol groups on aliphatic chains tend to give high yield.**

  *Aromatic thiols can strongly bind to metal centers, potentially poisoning the catalyst. In contrast, aliphatic thiols are less likely to interfere and may even participate beneficially in the reaction mechanism.*

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups tend to give low yield.**

  *Highly electronegative fluorinated groups can create a strongly electron-deficient environment, which may destabilize reactive intermediates or negatively affect catalyst activity.*

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing terminal hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains tend to give low yield.**

  *Terminal hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds or engage in side reactions, which may interfere with the catalyst or the reaction mechanism, leading to lower yields.*

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with longer aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) bearing an amino group tend to give high yield.**

  *Longer aliphatic chains with amino groups can enhance interactions with the catalyst through increased flexibility and favorable geometry, potentially stabilizing transition states and improving yield.*

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are sugar acids (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) tend to give high yield.**

  *Multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar acids can facilitate coordination with metal centers, increasing catalyst stability and activity, thereby enhancing the reaction yield.*

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings bearing electron-withdrawing substituents attached to aliphatic chains tend to give high yield, whereas similar structures with electron-donating substituents tend to give low yield.**

  *Electron-withdrawing substituents on aromatic rings can improve reactivity by stabilizing negative charges in reaction intermediates, especially when connected via flexible aliphatic chains that allow optimal positioning.*

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with amide linkages tend to give low yield.**

  *Amide groups can coordinate strongly with metal catalysts, potentially blocking active sites or altering catalyst activity adversely, which can reduce the reaction yield.*

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or bromomethyl tend to give high yield. In contrast, those substituted with electron-donating groups like methyl or aldehyde (formyl) groups tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize catalytic intermediates by enhancing metal coordination and facilitating electron transfer processes, which improves catalyst activity. Electron-donating groups, such as methyl, can destabilize intermediates and reduce catalyst efficiency. Aldehyde groups, despite being electron-withdrawing, may participate in side reactions or coordinate unfavorably with the catalyst, leading to decreased yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) or aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., tryptophan) tend to give high yield. Conversely, amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine) or those with modified amino groups (e.g., N-acetylated amino acids) tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Acidic side chains provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through stronger metal-ligand interactions. Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms, like the indole nitrogen in tryptophan, facilitate favorable interactions with the metal center, promoting electron transfer. Hydrophobic aromatic side chains without heteroatoms or modified amino groups may not interact effectively with the catalyst, reducing yield.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of six to eight carbons (C6–C8) and lacking terminal polar functional groups tend to give high yield. Introducing terminal polar groups such as hydroxyl or amino groups at the chain ends tends to result in low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Long hydrophobic chains enhance catalyst-substrate interactions by improving the dispersion and accessibility of the catalyst. Terminal polar groups may interfere with these interactions by altering the solubility or binding properties of the catalyst, thus reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing aliphatic thiol groups (-SH) tend to give high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings result in low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Aliphatic thiols form favorable, yet not overly strong, sulfur-metal interactions that promote efficient catalysis. Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings may bind too strongly or sterically hinder the active site, potentially deactivating the catalyst and lowering the yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages within aliphatic chains (e.g., polyether chains) tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Ether oxygens can non-productively coordinate with metal centers, blocking active sites or altering the catalyst's structure. This interference reduces catalytic activity by preventing optimal substrate access or electron transfer.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids or pyridone carboxylic acids tend to give high yield. However, when the pyridine ring is part of a larger conjugated system or attached to additional aromatic rings (e.g., pyridinylbenzoic acids), the yield tends to be low.**

  *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in pyridine or pyridone rings can coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance through improved interaction and electron transfer. Extending conjugation or adding aromatic rings can alter the electronic properties and steric factors, potentially reducing the ability of the nitrogen to coordinate with the metal and lowering the yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings connected to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of four carbons or more tend to give high yield. Those with shorter aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer) between the aromatic ring and carboxylic acid tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and appropriate spacing, allowing the aromatic ring and carboxylic acid to interact favorably with different parts of the catalyst. This can enhance binding and catalytic activity. Shorter chains may result in steric hindrance or poor orientation, reducing effective interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde groups attached directly to aromatic rings (e.g., formylbenzoic acids) tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may participate in side reactions or bind irreversibly to the catalyst, reducing its availability. They may also interfere with metal coordination, destabilizing catalytic intermediates and decreasing overall efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups (e.g., perfluorinated carboxylic acids) tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Highly fluorinated groups are strongly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can hinder effective metal coordination and disrupt catalyst-substrate interactions.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and lacking terminal polar functional groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups tend to give high yield.**

  *Explanation*: Medium-length aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, improving dispersion and access to the active sites. The absence of terminal polar groups prevents interference with these interactions, leading to increased catalytic efficiency and higher yields.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) or aromatic side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., tryptophan) tend to give high yield. Conversely, amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine) or those that are N-acetylated tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Acidic side chains provide additional metal coordination sites through their carboxylate groups, enhancing catalyst stability via chelation. Aromatic side chains with nitrogen heterocycles, like the indole ring in tryptophan, facilitate favorable interactions with metal centers, promoting electron transfer and catalytic activity. Hydrophobic aromatic side chains without heteroatoms or modifications that block amino coordination (e.g., N-acetylation) reduce these beneficial interactions, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or bromomethyl tend to give high yield. In contrast, those substituted with electron-donating groups like methyl or hydroxyl, or with reactive groups like aldehyde, tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid and strengthen metal-ligand coordination by stabilizing negative charge buildup on the ligand. This stabilization facilitates better catalyst-modifier interactions and electron transfer processes, improving catalytic activity. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken metal coordination, while reactive groups like aldehydes may participate in side reactions or inhibit catalyst function, resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing aliphatic thiol groups (-SH) tend to give high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Aliphatic thiols can form moderate sulfur-metal interactions that enhance catalyst performance without strongly deactivating the metal center. Thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings may bind too strongly to the metal or cause steric hindrance at the active site, potentially deactivating the catalyst and reducing yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids with an unmodified pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to give high yield. However, when the pyridine ring is part of a larger conjugated system or fused to additional aromatic rings (e.g., pyridinylbenzoic acids), the yield tends to be low.**

  *Explanation*: The lone pair on the nitrogen atom of an unmodified pyridine ring can effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. When the pyridine ring is extended into larger conjugated systems, its electron density and geometry change, potentially reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal and thus diminishing catalytic performance.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid (e.g., polyhydroxy carboxylic acids like gluconic acid) tend to give high yield.**

  *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate strong metal coordination through chelation and hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. This enhanced binding improves electron transfer and substrate activation processes, leading to increased catalytic efficiency and higher yields.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages within aliphatic chains (e.g., polyether chains) tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with metal centers in a way that blocks or alters the active site geometry, leading to non-productive interactions. This interference can prevent optimal substrate access or disrupt electron transfer pathways, reducing catalytic activity and yield.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups (e.g., perfluoroalkanoic acids) tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Perfluorinated groups are highly electron-withdrawing and significantly alter the electronic properties of the modifier, potentially destabilizing metal-ligand interactions. Their strong hydrophobic nature can also hinder effective catalyst dispersion in the reaction medium, reducing accessibility to active sites and lowering yield.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with terminal amino groups on aliphatic chains longer than four carbons tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Terminal amino groups can engage in undesired interactions with the metal center or other components of the catalyst, potentially leading to catalyst deactivation or alteration of its structure. In longer chains, these effects are more pronounced due to increased flexibility and reach, which can disrupt optimal catalytic function and decrease yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups attached directly to aromatic rings (e.g., formylbenzoic acids) tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups are highly reactive and can participate in side reactions with nucleophilic species in the reaction mixture or coordinate irreversibly with the catalyst's metal center. Such interactions can inhibit the catalyst's activity by blocking active sites or altering its electronic properties, resulting in reduced yields.

Complexity is low, focusing on a specific functional group. **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (entry 13) supports the rule with low yield. Coverage is limited with a single data point, indicating a need for more examples.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* is clear in specifying that terminal amino groups on longer aliphatic chains lead to low yield. The property insight about catalyst deactivation is credible. Complexity is moderate. Data points like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (entry 31) and **8-aminooctanoic acid** (entry 34) show low yield, supporting the rule. Coverage meets the criteria with at least two examples.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* clearly identifies modifiers with aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings as leading to low yield. The property insight regarding side reactions and catalyst inhibition is valid.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* clearly states that N-acetylated amino acids tend to give low yield. The property insight regarding the blocking of amino groups and reduced metal coordination is sound. Complexity is low, focusing on a single modification. Coverage is limited but includes **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (low yield). **Rule 4 scores well on clarity and property insight but has lower coverage.**

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* provides clear guidelines based on the electronic effects of substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids. The property insight is strong, relating electron-withdrawing/donating groups to metal coordination strength. The complexity is higher, involving electronic properties and substituent effects. Coverage is good, with data like **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (high yield) and **4-methylbenzoic acid** (low yield). **Rule 5 scores excellently on all criteria.**

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* clearly distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing modifiers. The property insight is good, explaining sulfur-metal interactions and their effects on catalyst activity. Complexity is moderate, considering both functional groups and their contexts. Coverage includes **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (high yield) and **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (low yield). **Rule 6 performs well across all criteria.**

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* is clear about modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups near carboxylic acids. The property insight into enhanced metal coordination through chelation is solid. Complexity is moderate, involving multiple functional groups. Coverage is supported by **gluconic acid** (high yield). **Rule 7 scores well on all criteria.**

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* clearly states that modifiers with ether linkages within aliphatic chains tend to give low yield. The property insight is adequate, addressing interference with metal coordination. Complexity is acceptable. Coverage includes **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (low yield). **Rule 8 scores well on clarity, property insight, and coverage.**

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* clearly identifies modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups as giving low yield. The property insight is reasonable, discussing electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is supported by **nonafluoropentanoic acid** (low yield). **Rule 9 performs well across the criteria.**

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* clearly notes that modifiers with aldehyde groups attached directly to aromatic rings tend to give low yield. The property insight about side reactions and catalyst inhibition is sound. Complexity is moderate. Coverage includes **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (both low yield). **Rule 10 scores highly on all criteria.**

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* specifies that amino acids with aliphatic side chains longer than five carbons and terminal amino groups tend to give low yield. Clarity is good, though counting carbon atoms requires attention. Property insight is acceptable, explaining potential catalyst deactivation. Complexity is moderate. Coverage includes **8-aminooctanoic acid** (low yield). **Rule 11 scores well but could benefit from additional supporting data points.**

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* states that modifiers containing indole groups tend to give high yield. This overlaps with Rule 3. Clarity is good, and property insight about metal coordination via indole nitrogen is adequate. Complexity is low due to specificity. Coverage includes **tryptophan** (high yield). **Rule 12 scores well but could be combined with Rule 3 for efficiency.**

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* clearly identifies modifiers with conjugated ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids as giving high yield. Property insight is solid, explaining enhanced electron transfer. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is supported by **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (high yield). **Rule 13 performs well on all criteria.**
