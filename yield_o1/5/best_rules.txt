**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing an aromatic ring with a para-substituted electron-withdrawing group (e.g., nitro, halogen, formyl) tend to give high yield.**

  *These modifiers enhance reactivity by stabilizing negative charges in reaction intermediates through resonance and inductive effects.*

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing an aromatic ring with a para-substituted electron-donating group (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) tend to give low yield.**

  *Electron-donating groups can destabilize reaction intermediates, reducing the efficiency of the catalytic process.*

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with additional carboxylic acid side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) tend to give high yield.**

  *The presence of multiple carboxylic acid groups allows for better coordination with the metal catalyst, enhancing reactivity.*

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine, tryptophan) tend to give low yield.**

  *Hydrophobic aromatic side chains may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst due to steric effects and reduced solubility.*

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde groups (-CHO) tend to give low yield.**

  *Aldehydes can undergo side reactions or coordinate with the catalyst in undesirable ways, interfering with the main reaction.*

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol groups on aliphatic chains tend to give high yield, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings tend to give low yield.**

  *Aliphatic thiols may facilitate the reaction through beneficial interactions with the catalyst, whereas aromatic thiols can poison the catalyst.*

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings with carboxylic acid groups directly attached (e.g., pyridine carboxylic acids, pyrazole carboxylic acids) tend to give high yield.**

  *Heteroatoms in aromatic rings can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing its activity and stabilizing intermediates.*

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) without additional polar functional groups tend to give high yield when they contain a terminal carboxylic acid.**

  *Long hydrophobic chains may improve interactions with the catalyst or substrate, enhancing reactivity.*

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids in aliphatic chains tend to give low yield.**

  *Such structures may chelate the metal catalyst, reducing its availability for the desired reaction.*

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with amide linkages or peptide bonds tend to give low yield.**

  *Amide groups can form strong interactions with the catalyst, potentially deactivating it or altering its activity.*

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are sugar acids with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., gluconic acid) tend to give high yield.**

  *Polyhydroxy groups can enhance catalyst coordination and stabilize reactive intermediates through hydrogen bonding.*

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing aliphatic chains with terminal hydroxyl groups tend to give low yield.**

  *Terminal hydroxyl groups may engage in side reactions or interfere with catalyst interaction, reducing yield.*

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups tend to give low yield.**

  *Highly electronegative fluorinated groups can negatively affect catalyst interactions and destabilize reaction intermediates.*

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings connected via additional aromatic rings (biaryl systems) tend to give low yield compared to those where functional groups are directly attached to the ring.**

  *Extended conjugation and increased steric hindrance can reduce the effectiveness of the modifier by altering electronic properties and impeding catalyst access.*

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages in aliphatic chains (e.g., polyether chains) tend to give low yield.**

  *Ether oxygens can coordinate with the metal catalyst, potentially disrupting its activity or leading to undesirable side reactions.*
