**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and lacking terminal polar functional groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups tend to give high yield.**

  *Explanation*: Medium-length aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, improving dispersion and access to active sites. The absence of terminal polar groups prevents interference with these interactions, leading to increased catalytic efficiency and higher yields.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) or containing multiple carboxylate groups tend to give high yield. In contrast, amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine) tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Acidic side chains provide additional metal coordination sites through their carboxylate groups, enhancing catalyst stability via chelation. Hydrophobic aromatic side chains without heteroatoms reduce these beneficial interactions, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic heterocycles in the side chain (e.g., tryptophan) tend to give high yield.**

  *Explanation*: Aromatic heterocycles with nitrogen atoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through improved electron transfer and substrate activation.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: N-acetylation blocks the amino group, reducing the ability to coordinate with the metal center, lowering catalyst efficiency and resulting in decreased yields.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or bromomethyl tend to give high yield. Conversely, those substituted with electron-donating groups like methyl or hydroxyl, or with reactive groups like aldehyde, tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid and strengthen metal-ligand coordination by stabilizing negative charge buildup on the ligand. This stabilization facilitates better catalyst-modifier interactions and electron transfer processes, improving catalytic activity. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken metal coordination, while reactive groups like aldehydes may participate in side reactions or inhibit catalyst function, resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aliphatic thiol groups (-SH) tend to give high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Aliphatic thiols can form moderate sulfur-metal interactions that enhance catalyst performance without strongly deactivating the metal center. Thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings may bind too strongly to the metal or cause steric hindrance at the active site, potentially deactivating the catalyst and reducing yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid (e.g., polyhydroxy carboxylic acids like gluconic acid) tend to give high yield.**

  *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate strong metal coordination through chelation and hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. This enhanced binding improves electron transfer and substrate activation processes, leading to increased catalytic efficiency and higher yields.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages within aliphatic chains (e.g., polyether chains or ethylene glycol units) tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with metal centers in a way that blocks or alters the active site geometry, leading to non-productive interactions. This interference can prevent optimal substrate access or disrupt electron transfer pathways, reducing catalytic activity and yield.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Perfluorinated groups are highly electron-withdrawing and significantly alter the electronic properties of the modifier, potentially destabilizing metal-ligand interactions. Their strong hydrophobic nature can also hinder effective catalyst dispersion in the reaction medium, reducing accessibility to active sites and lowering yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde groups attached directly to aromatic rings tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups are highly reactive and can participate in side reactions or coordinate irreversibly with the catalyst's metal center. Such interactions can inhibit the catalyst's activity by blocking active sites or altering its electronic properties, resulting in reduced yields.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aliphatic side chains longer than five carbons and terminal amino groups tend to give low yield.**

  *Explanation*: Terminal amino groups on long aliphatic chains can engage in undesired interactions with the metal center, potentially leading to catalyst deactivation. The increased flexibility and reach of longer chains can disrupt optimal catalytic function and decrease yield.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing indole groups (e.g., tryptophan) tend to give high yield.**

  *Explanation*: Indole rings possess nitrogen atoms that can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity and electron transfer processes.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with conjugated ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to give high yield.**

  *Explanation*: Conjugated ketone groups can interact with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst and promoting efficient electron transfer, which enhances catalytic activity and increases yield.
