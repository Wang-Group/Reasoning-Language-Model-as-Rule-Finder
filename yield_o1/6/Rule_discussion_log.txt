Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in specifying that the modifiers are α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, which yield **high** yield. It is straightforward to determine whether a modifier fits this structural description. The rule provides property insight by linking the presence of additional carboxylic acid groups to enhanced coordination with metal centers, potentially increasing catalytic efficiency. The complexity is appropriate, combining the amino acid structure with a specific side-chain functionality. Coverage is supported by at least two data points ((2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), achieving a good balance between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly defines modifiers as benzoic acid derivatives substituted at the para position with strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) that yield **high** yield. The clarity is high, making it easy to identify applicable modifiers. The property insight is sound, as electron-withdrawing groups can influence the electron density and coordination properties, affecting the reaction outcome. The rule exhibits suitable complexity by incorporating both the functional group and its position on the aromatic ring. Coverage is adequate with examples like 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid, maintaining a good balance.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 states that modifiers which are benzoic acid derivatives substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxy, methoxy) yield **low** yield. The rule is clear and allows for easy determination of matching modifiers. The property insight aligns with electronic effects influencing the catalyst's performance. Complexity is appropriate, considering both the type and position of substituents. Coverage is sufficient with multiple examples (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), achieving a balance between simplicity and applicability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 indicates that modifiers containing nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) yield **high** yield. The clarity is high, and such modifiers can be readily identified. The property insight is strong, as nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity. The rule's complexity is suitable, combining heteroaromatic structures with carboxylic acid groups. Coverage is solid with examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, providing a good balance.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 specifies that modifiers with aliphatic chains longer than six carbons and terminal amino groups yield **low** yield. The clarity is acceptable, though chain length cutoffs need careful consideration. The property insight may involve steric hindrance or reduced solubility affecting catalyst interaction. Complexity is moderate, combining chain length and functional group presence. Coverage includes at least two examples (7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), achieving reasonable balance.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 states that modifiers containing aliphatic chains with terminal thiol groups yield **high** yield, unless the thiol is attached directly to an aromatic ring, in which case they yield **low** yield. The rule is clear but requires attention to the thiol's position. Property insight suggests that the thiol group's position affects its coordination ability. Complexity is appropriately high, considering both functional groups and their attachment points. Coverage is adequate with examples like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield), offering a balanced approach.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 asserts that modifiers with highly fluorinated aliphatic chains yield **low** yield. Clarity is moderate; "highly fluorinated" may benefit from quantitative definition. Property insight could relate to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine affecting interactions. Complexity is low, focusing on a single feature. Coverage is limited, with only one example (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), which weakens the rule's balance and reliability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 mentions that modifiers which are benzoic acid derivatives with aldehyde (formyl) substituents yield **low** yield. The rule is clear and specific. Property insight involves the aldehyde group potentially interfering with catalyst coordination or acting as a competing reactive site. Complexity is appropriate, combining the aromatic structure with a reactive substituent. Coverage includes two data points (5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid), achieving acceptable balance.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 observes that modifiers which are α-amino acids with aromatic side chains yield **low** yield unless the side chain contains a nitrogen heterocycle, in which case they yield **high** yield. Clarity is moderate due to the exception clause but is manageable. Property insight is notable, suggesting that nitrogen-containing side chains enhance coordination, while other aromatics may not. Complexity is higher due to conditional statements. Coverage is sufficient with examples like (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (low yield) and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (high yield), maintaining balance.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 claims that modifiers with aliphatic chains bearing multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., sugar acids like gluconic acid) yield **high** yield. Clarity is acceptable, though specifying "multiple" could improve precision. Property insight relates to hydroxyl groups enhancing solubility or coordination potential. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is limited, with one example ((2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), which affects the rule's reliability and balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 suggests that modifiers containing aliphatic hydroxyl groups on chains longer than four carbons yield **low** yield. Clarity is fair, but exact chain length parameters could be clearer. Property insight might involve steric factors or reduced reactivity. Complexity is low. Coverage is minimal, with only one supporting example (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), resulting in weak balance and limited applicability.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 indicates that modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents connected via amide linkage yield **low** yield. Clarity is moderate; defining "bulky" requires interpretation. Property insight may involve steric hindrance affecting catalyst access. Complexity is high due to multiple structural considerations. Coverage is limited to few examples (e.g., 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid), which diminishes the rule's balance and overall strength.

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** is clear in its structural description: α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylate groups yield high yield. The rule is supported by two data points—(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid) and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid)—both yielding high. The property insight is strong, as additional carboxylate groups can enhance coordination with metal centers, influencing catalytic activity. The rule balances complexity and coverage well by considering both the amino acid backbone and the specific side chain functionality.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** specifies that α-amino acids with side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles yield high yield. It is clear and provides good property insight since nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metals. However, it is supported by only one data point—tryptophan—with high yield, which does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two data points. The rule has acceptable complexity by combining amino acid structure with specific side chain features.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** states that α-amino acids with hydrophobic or aromatic side chains yield low yield. The rule is clear and supported by at least two data points—phenylalanine and a methionine derivative—both yielding low. The property insight is adequate, suggesting that hydrophobic or non-coordinating side chains may not favor interaction with the catalyst. The complexity is balanced, considering both the amino acid structure and side chain properties.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** describes that aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups located 2 to 5 carbons away from the carboxylate yield high yield if the carbon chain length is five carbons or fewer. The rule is clear but somewhat complex due to the specific chain length requirement. It is supported by high-yield data for 5-aminopentanoic acid and low-yield data for longer-chain counterparts like 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid, satisfying the coverage criterion. The property insight is reasonable, as shorter chains might facilitate better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** focuses on para-substituted benzoic acid derivatives, yielding high when substituted with amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups, and low with methyl, formyl, or thiol groups. The rule is clear and supported by multiple data points for both high and low yields, meeting the coverage criterion. The property insight is solid, highlighting how different substituents affect electronic properties and metal coordination. The rule's complexity is justified by considering both the position and nature of substituents.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** indicates that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen within the ring yield high yield. The rule is clear and supported by three data points—all yielding high—which satisfies the coverage criterion. The property insight is strong, as nitrogen atoms in heterocycles are known to coordinate with metal centers. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on a specific class of compounds.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** differentiates between aliphatic thiol modifiers yielding high yield and aromatic thiol modifiers yielding low yield. The rule is clear and supported by one high-yield example (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) and one low-yield example (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), meeting the minimum coverage requirement. The property insight is acceptable, considering how thiol group environment affects metal coordination. The complexity is balanced, contrasting aliphatic and aromatic contexts.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** states that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains (e.g., sugar acids) yield high yield. While the rule is clear and offers good property insight, it is supported by only one data point—(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid—yielding high. This does not meet the coverage criterion. The complexity is acceptable, focusing on polyhydroxylated structures.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** indicates that modifiers where a pyridine ring is connected to the carboxylate via an aliphatic linker yield high yield, while those connected via aromatic rings yield low yield. The rule is clear and supported by two data points—4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (high yield) and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (low yield)—satisfying the coverage criterion. The property insight is reasonable, as the nature of the linker can influence the distance and orientation of coordination sites. The complexity is well-balanced.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** states that modifiers with highly fluorinated aliphatic chains yield low yield. The rule is clear but supported by only one data point—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid—yielding low. This fails to meet the coverage criterion. The property insight is limited but suggests that fluorination may hinder interaction with the catalyst. The complexity is low.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** indicates that modifiers containing aldehyde or ketone groups directly attached to the aromatic ring yield low yield. The rule is clear and supported by two data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—both yielding low, satisfying the coverage criterion. The property insight is good, as carbonyl groups can withdraw electron density, affecting coordination. The complexity is acceptable.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** states that modifiers that are cyclic anhydrides or contain lactone structures fused to aromatic rings yield high yield. The rule is clear but supported by only one data point—1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid—yielding high. This does not meet the coverage criterion. The property insight is plausible, as such structures may enhance interaction with the catalyst. The complexity is moderate.

- **Comment 13**:

  **Rule 13** specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of six carbons or more, terminated with amino or hydroxyl groups, yield low yield. The rule is clear and supported by multiple data points—7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid—all yielding low. This satisfies the coverage criterion. The property insight is reasonable, as longer chains may reduce the effectiveness of coordination. The complexity is balanced.

- **Comment 14**:

  **Rule 14** mentions that modifiers containing aliphatic thioether groups yield low yield. The rule is clear but supported by only one data point—2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid—yielding low. This does not meet the coverage criterion. The property insight is limited, and the complexity is low.

- **Comment 15**:

  **Rule 15** states that modifiers with bulky aromatic groups connected to the carboxylate via amide linkages yield low yield. The rule is clear but supported by only one data point—2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid—yielding low. This fails to meet the coverage criterion. The property insight is acceptable, suggesting steric hindrance may affect catalyst interaction. The complexity is moderate.

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate the relationship between the functional groups present in molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the reaction. The rules are based on the analysis of the underlying chemical properties, such as the electronic effects of substituents, the presence of specific functional groups, and the overall structure of the modifiers. Modifiers that enhance electron deficiency on the aromatic ring or introduce coordination sites for metal ions tend to increase the yield, while those that introduce electron-rich environments or potential competing coordination sites tend to decrease the yield.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* has inconsistencies between its description and examples. The rule states that **electron-withdrawing substituents** on aromatic carboxylic acids yield **high** yield, while **electron-donating or reactive substituents** yield **low** yield. However, **4-aminobenzoic acid** (with an electron-donating amino group) is listed as a **high** yield example, and **4-formylbenzoic acid** (with an electron-withdrawing formyl group) is listed as **low** yield. This contradiction reduces the clarity of the rule and suggests that the relationship between substituent electronic effects and yield may not be straightforward.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 4* lacks sufficient coverage, as it is supported by only **one data point**—**(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**. While the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains might influence the yield, more data points are needed to validate this rule and enhance its reliability.

- **Comment 3**: *Rules 11 and 12* are each based on a single data point. **Rule 11** cites **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** as the sole example, and **Rule 12** references **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**. The limited data support makes it difficult to assess the general applicability of these rules. Additional examples are necessary to confirm the trends suggested by these rules.

- **Comment 4**: Several rules, including *Rules 6, 8, 9, and 13*, have limited coverage with only **two data points** each. For instance, **Rule 6** differentiates between aliphatic and aromatic thiol groups but is supported by only one example of each. Similarly, **Rule 8** distinguishes between pyridine rings connected via aliphatic versus aromatic linkers with minimal data support. The limited number of examples reduces confidence in these rules' validity.

- **Comment 5**: Overall, while some rules demonstrate clear patterns and are backed by multiple data points (e.g., *Rules 2, 3, 5, and 7*), the inconsistencies and limited coverage in other rules suggest that the current set of rules may not be comprehensive enough. Enhancing the dataset with additional modifiers and refining the rules for clarity and broader applicability would improve their effectiveness in predicting reaction yields.

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* is clear and allows for straightforward classification of modifiers based on the presence of strong electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids. The property insight is solid, recognizing the influence of electronic effects on the aromatic ring and subsequent coordination in the catalytic process. The rule incorporates complexity by considering both the aromatic system and the nature of substituents. It is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., high yield with 4-nitrobenzoic acid, low yield with 4-methylbenzoic acid), ensuring good coverage. The balance between specificity and applicability makes this rule effective.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* clearly identifies modifiers with a para-amino group on aromatic carboxylic acids as yielding high yields due to potential metal ion coordination. The rule demonstrates strong property insight by acknowledging the chelating ability of the amino group despite its electron-donating nature. While the rule focuses on a specific functional group, the complexity is appropriate given its significant impact on the reaction. Coverage is adequate, supported by the high yield observed with 4-aminobenzoic acid. The balance between specificity and generalizability is maintained.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* distinguishes between nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid (high yield) and those connected via an aromatic linker (low yield). The clarity is good, and the rule offers valuable property insight into how the attachment mode affects coordination with the catalyst. The complexity is moderate, considering both the heterocycle and its linkage. Coverage is sufficient, with examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid yielding high yield and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yielding low yield. The rule strikes a reasonable balance between detail and applicability.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* is clear in its classification of α-amino acids with acidic side chains as high-yielding modifiers, while those with hydrophobic or basic side chains yield low yields. The property insight is strong, linking the presence of additional carboxyl groups to enhanced metal coordination. The rule involves complexity by considering side chain properties in addition to the amino acid backbone. Coverage is robust, with multiple supporting data points such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid (high yield) versus phenylalanine (low yield). The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* clearly states that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yields, whereas longer chains or single hydroxyl groups result in low yields. The property insight is sound, as multiple hydroxyl groups can increase coordination sites, and shorter chains may facilitate better interaction with the catalyst. The rule has moderate complexity, taking into account both functional group multiplicity and chain length. Coverage includes examples like gluconic acid (high yield) and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (low yield), offering good support. The rule balances specificity with general applicability.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* provides clear guidance that short aliphatic chains (≤5 carbons) with an amino group yield high yields, while longer chains do not. The property insight reflects the idea that shorter chains may position the amino group favorably for coordination. Complexity is minimal but appropriate for this context. Coverage is adequate, evidenced by 5-aminopentanoic acid yielding high yield and 7-aminoheptanoic acid yielding low yield. The balance is acceptable, although additional data points could enhance the rule.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* distinctly separates modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups (high yield) from those with aromatic thiol groups (low yield). The clarity is strong, and the property insight appropriately considers the differing coordination behaviors of aliphatic versus aromatic thiols. The complexity is moderate, focusing on functional group type and its structural context. Coverage is demonstrated through examples like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield). The rule maintains a good balance between detail and generality.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* is clear in stating that fluorinated aliphatic chains yield low yields due to electron-withdrawing effects hindering coordination. The property insight is valid, acknowledging how strong electron-withdrawing groups can negatively impact catalyst interaction. The complexity is limited, focusing on a single structural feature. Coverage is somewhat limited, primarily supported by 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid (low yield). While the rule is sound, additional supporting data would improve its robustness.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* clearly indicates that ether linkages in aliphatic chains lead to low yields, possibly due to increased molecular flexibility affecting coordination. The property insight is reasonable, considering how flexibility can influence binding interactions. Complexity is moderate, accounting for both the presence of ether groups and chain dynamics. Coverage includes modifiers like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (low yield). The balance is acceptable, though more examples would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* provides a clear directive that aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings yield low yields, likely due to side reactions or catalyst deactivation. The property insight is strong, recognizing the reactivity of aldehyde groups. The complexity is minimal but sufficient for the rule's purpose. Coverage is supported by examples such as 4-formylbenzoic acid (low yield). The balance between simplicity and applicability is appropriate.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* suggests that modifiers with aromatic ketone groups conjugated with electron-donating substituents yield high yields by enhancing coordination. The clarity is moderate; specifying positions and types of electron-donating groups would improve it. The property insight is plausible, linking conjugation and electronic effects to catalytic activity. Complexity is higher due to the combination of functional groups and electronic properties. Coverage appears limited, primarily exemplified by 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (high yield). Additional data points would enhance coverage and balance.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* clearly states that long-chain aliphatic acids without additional coordination sites yield low yields. The property insight is sound, as such molecules may lack the necessary interaction with the catalyst. Complexity is low, focusing on chain length and absence of coordinating groups. Coverage is adequate, with examples like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (low yield). The balance between simplicity and effectiveness is maintained.

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* identifies that aromatic rings fused to lactone or cyclic anhydride structures yield high yields by offering rigid coordination sites. The rule is clear, and the property insight is strong, recognizing the benefits of rigidity in coordination chemistry. Complexity is moderate, involving fused ring systems and functional groups. Coverage is limited, with 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid as a primary example (high yield). More supporting data would enhance the rule's robustness and balance.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* clearly notes that aromatic heterocycles connected via a short aliphatic linker to the carboxyl group yield high yields. The property insight is acceptable, suggesting that the linker allows for flexible yet effective coordination. Complexity is moderate, combining heterocycles, linkers, and functional groups. Coverage includes 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (high yield), but additional examples would strengthen the rule. The balance between detail and applicability is reasonable.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* clearly states that modifiers with thioether groups in the side chain yield low yields due to potential interference with catalyst sites. The property insight is valid, as thioethers may bind undesirably to the catalyst. Complexity is low, focusing on a specific functional group. Coverage is limited, supported by 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid (low yield). More data points would improve the rule's coverage and balance.

It provides chemical insight into how electron-withdrawing groups enhance catalyst coordination, thus increasing the yield. The rule considers the combination of an aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, and substituent effects, adding complexity. It is supported by multiple data points, such as 4-nitrobenzoic acid (high yield) and 4-methylbenzoic acid (low yield), demonstrating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly differentiates between modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group (high yield) and those connected via an aromatic linker (low yield). It offers insight into the importance of direct coordination sites for metal ion interaction. The rule combines heterocyclic structures and attachment points, adding complexity. Data points like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (high yield) and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (low yield) support the rule, ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in distinguishing α-amino acids with acidic side chains (high yield) from those with nonpolar or basic side chains (low yield). It provides insight into how acidic side chains may enhance coordination with the catalyst. The rule considers both the backbone and side chain properties, increasing complexity. Supported by data points such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid (high yield) versus phenylalanine and acetylated lysine (low yield), it demonstrates good coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups on short chains (≤5 carbons) yield high yield, while those with longer chains (>5 carbons) yield low yield. It offers insight into how chain length affects effective coordination with the catalyst. The rule combines functional groups with chain length considerations, adding complexity. Supported by data points like 5-aminopentanoic acid (high yield) and 7-aminoheptanoic acid (low yield), it shows good coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 specifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yield, whereas those with single hydroxyl groups or longer chains yield low yield. This provides insight into the role of multiple coordination sites and chain length in enhancing catalyst interaction. The rule's complexity arises from considering both hydroxyl group count and chain length. Data points like gluconic acid (high yield) and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (low yield) support the rule, indicating good coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 distinguishes between aliphatic thiol modifiers yielding high yield and aromatic thiol modifiers yielding low yield. The rule is clear and provides insight into the impact of the thiol group's environment on coordination. By combining functional group type and the aliphatic or aromatic nature, it adds complexity. Supported by 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield), the rule has adequate coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in stating that fluorinated aliphatic chain modifiers yield low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects interfering with coordination. It offers property insight into how fluorination affects the catalyst interaction. However, the rule is supported by a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), indicating limited coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 indicates that modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains yield low yield, possibly due to increased flexibility hindering effective coordination. The rule is clear and adds complexity by considering both functional groups and chain dynamics. Supported by data points like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (low yield), coverage is present but could be strengthened with more examples.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic rings yield low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst interference. It provides chemical insight into functional group effects on the catalyst. While supported by 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (both low yield), additional data points could enhance coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 suggests that modifiers with aromatic ketone groups conjugated with electron-donating substituents yield high yield by enhancing coordination. The rule offers chemical insight but is supported by a single data point (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), indicating limited coverage and the need for more data to confirm its generality.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-amino group yield high yield due to potential chelation with metal ions. It is clear and provides insight into the functional group's effect on coordination. Supported by 4-aminobenzoic acid (high yield), coverage is minimal and could benefit from additional supporting examples.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear in indicating that modifiers with bulky hydrophobic groups without additional coordination sites yield low yield due to steric hindrance and poor catalyst interaction. It offers chemical insight and is supported by data points like phenylalanine and acetylated lysine (both low yield), showing reasonable coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that modifiers with fused aromatic lactone or cyclic anhydride structures yield high yield by providing rigid coordination sites. The rule is clear and adds complexity due to the specific structural features considered. Supported by 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (high yield), coverage is limited and would benefit from more examples.

**Explanation and Analysis:**

The above rules have been generated by analyzing the provided dataset and considering the structural features that correlate with high or low yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules focus on combinations of functional groups and substructures within the molecular modifiers, linking them to the observed yields based on underlying chemical principles.

- **Hydrophilic vs. Hydrophobic Interactions:** Rules 1, 4, and 5 highlight the importance of hydrophilic functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) in promoting high yields through enhanced coordination with the catalyst. Conversely, bulky hydrophobic groups can hinder this interaction.
- **Electronic Effects:** Rules 2, 9, and 12 address how electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups influence the yield. Strong electron-withdrawing groups can enhance coordination or deactivate interfering sites, while electron-donating groups may reduce effectiveness.
- **Steric Considerations:** Rules 5 and 7 consider the impact of steric hindrance due to bulky groups or long aliphatic chains, which can impede effective catalyst interaction.
- **Coordination Ability:** Rules 6, 10, 11, and 13 emphasize functional groups capable of coordinating with the metal center (e.g., thiols, amines, chelating rings), which enhance catalytic activity and increase yields.
- **Flexibility and Chain Length:** Rule 8 notes that excessive flexibility from ether linkages can reduce effective coordination by allowing the modifier to adopt conformations less favorable for interaction with the catalyst.
- **Potential Side Reactions:** Rule 12 points out that certain functional groups, like aldehydes and ketones attached to aromatic rings, may engage in side reactions or block active sites, leading to lower yields.

These rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity. They can be used to predict the yield outcome for new modifiers based on their structural features, aiding in the rational design of modifiers for optimized catalytic activity.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward determination of yield based on the nature of the side chain in α-amino acids. The physical-chemical insight is strong, linking acidic side chains to enhanced coordination with the catalyst due to additional carboxyl groups, while nonpolar or bulky hydrophobic side chains reduce interaction. The rule considers combinations of functional groups (α-amino acid backbone and side chain properties), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points—including aspartic acid and glutamic acid yielding high yield, and phenylalanine and acetylated lysine yielding low yield—ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 provides a clear guideline based on the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids. The physical-chemical insight is solid, as strong electron-withdrawing groups can enhance coordination with the metal center, increasing yield, while electron-donating groups may decrease it. The rule balances complexity by focusing on specific substituents and their electronic effects. It is supported by at least two data points for both high yields (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid) and low yields (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid), showing good coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in specifying that modifiers which are aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the aromatic ring yield high yields. The chemical reasoning is sound, as nitrogen-containing heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. The rule appropriately combines structural features (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, attached nitrogen heterocycle), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points with high yields, such as nicotinic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly states that modifiers with multiple hydrophilic functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) within short aliphatic chains (≤6 carbons) yield high yields. The insight is logical, as hydrophilic groups can enhance solubility and coordination with the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of functional groups and chain length, adding complexity. It is supported by several high yield examples—such as 5-aminopentanoic acid, gluconic acid, and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid—meeting the coverage criterion and achieving balance.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear about modifiers with bulky hydrophobic aromatic side chains yielding low yields due to steric hindrance and poor coordination with the catalyst. The physical-chemical insight is valid, acknowledging how steric effects can impede effective catalyst interactions. The rule combines functional group properties and steric factors, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points with low yields, such as phenylalanine and tryptophan derivatives, ensuring coverage and balance.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 differentiates between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing modifiers, stating that aliphatic thiols yield high yields while aromatic thiols yield low yields. It is clear and provides physical-chemical insight into how aliphatic thiols can form better interactions with the catalyst compared to aromatic thiols, which may be less reactive or hindered. The rule considers the nature of the thiol group and its surrounding structure, adding complexity. Coverage is met with examples of both high yield (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) and low yield (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid) modifiers, ensuring balance.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in stating that modifiers with long aliphatic chains (>6 carbons) without additional polar functional groups result in low yields due to poor solubility and reduced interaction with the catalyst. The insight is sensible, linking chain length and lack of polarity to decreased effectiveness. The rule considers chain length and functional group presence, adding complexity. It is supported by multiple low yield data points, such as 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid, satisfying coverage and achieving balance.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 specifies that modifiers with ether linkages in flexible aliphatic chains yield low yields due to decreased effective coordination with the catalyst. This is clear, and the insight about flexibility reducing the ability to interact effectively with the metal center is reasonable. The rule considers specific functional groups (ether linkages) and chain flexibility, meeting the complexity criterion. It has coverage with low yield examples like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, ensuring balance.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 addresses modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups on aliphatic chains, such as perfluorinated chains, yielding low yields due to interference with catalyst coordination. The clarity is acceptable, though it could be more specific about the types of electron-withdrawing groups. The physical-chemical insight is valid, recognizing that strong electron-withdrawing groups can hinder interaction with the catalyst. Complexity is present through combining chain type and functional groups. Coverage is somewhat limited, with only one low yield example (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), but acceptable given the specificity, achieving balance.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups in the para position yield high yields due to enhanced coordination ability. The insight is sound, as amino groups can act as ligands coordinating to the metal center. The rule focuses on specific functional group placement, providing necessary complexity. Coverage is sufficient with high yield examples like 4-aminobenzoic acid, ensuring balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear in specifying that modifiers with functional groups capable of chelation (e.g., adjacent carbonyls, hydroxyls) in rigid ring systems yield high yields by effectively stabilizing the metal center. The physical-chemical insight about chelation enhancing catalyst stability and activity is strong. The rule combines multiple functional aspects, adding complexity. Coverage is somewhat limited, with one high yield example (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), but the specificity justifies it, maintaining balance.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear in stating that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic rings yield low yields due to potential side reactions or blocking of active sites. The insight about these functional groups interfering with the reaction is reasonable. The rule considers both the functional group and its placement, adding complexity. Coverage is acceptable with low yield examples such as 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, ensuring balance.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 specifies that modifiers with heteroaromatic rings connected via short aliphatic chains to the carboxyl group yield high yields due to favorable interactions with the metal center. The clarity is good, and the insight about heteroaromatic rings enhancing coordination is valid. The rule combines structural features, meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage is limited with one high yield example (4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), but acceptable given the rule's specificity, maintaining balance.

**Explanation and Analysis:**

The generated rules are designed to capture the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the resulting high or low yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider underlying physicochemical properties such as electronic effects, steric factors, and coordination capabilities with the catalyst.

- **Coordination Ability:** Rules 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 11 emphasize the importance of functional groups (e.g., amino acids with acidic side chains, nitrogen heterocycles, multiple hydroxyl groups, thiols) that can effectively coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity and resulting in high yields.

- **Electronic Effects:** Rules 2, 9, 12, and 13 focus on how electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups influence yield. Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids enhance coordination with the catalyst, leading to high yields, while electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) reduce coordination efficiency and yield.

- **Steric Considerations and Chain Length:** Rules 7, 8, and 14 address how steric hindrance and chain length affect yield. Long aliphatic chains without additional polar groups decrease solubility and catalyst interaction (Rule 7), while flexible ether linkages can reduce effective coordination due to increased conformational freedom (Rule 8). The chain length in aromatic carboxylic acids with aliphatic extensions influences flexibility and coordination (Rule 14).

- **Functional Group Interactions:** Rules 12 and 13 highlight that certain functional groups can lead to low yields by engaging in side reactions or blocking active sites (e.g., aldehydes, ketones, methoxy groups on aromatic rings).

- **Hydrophilicity and Solubility:** Rule 15 underlines the role of hydrophilic functional groups in short-chain aliphatic acids, enhancing solubility and interaction with the catalyst, thus promoting high yields.

These rules strike a balance between coverage and specificity, allowing for the prediction of high or low yields based on the combination of structural features in the modifiers. By applying these rules, one can rationally design or select modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction. The rules have been refined to better align with the dataset and provide clearer guidance for future modifier selection.

**Explanation and Analysis:**

The above rules establish a relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the **yield** of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules incorporate combinations of functional groups and underlying physicochemical properties to predict whether a modifier will result in a **high** or **low** yield.

**Key Factors Influencing Yield:**

1. **Metal Coordination Ability**: Functional groups capable of effectively coordinating with the metal center, such as amino acids with acidic side chains, nitrogen heterocycles, and chelating groups, enhance the catalyst's activity, leading to **high yields** (Rules 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12).

2. **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings increase the metal coordination efficiency, resulting in **high yields**, while electron-donating groups decrease coordination, leading to **low yields** (Rules 2, 8, 10, 11).

3. **Steric Hindrance and Chain Length**: Short aliphatic chains with polar functional groups improve solubility and catalyst interaction (**high yield**), whereas long chains without such groups hinder these interactions (**low yield**) (Rules 4, 6, 7, 13).

4. **Functional Group Positioning**: The position of functional groups, such as thiols or heterocycles, relative to the aromatic ring or aliphatic chain affects their ability to coordinate with the metal center (Rules 3, 5, 12).

5. **Flexibility and Conformational Freedom**: Flexible linkages like ethers can reduce effective coordination due to increased conformational freedom, resulting in **low yields** (Rule 7).

**Application of Rules:**

- By applying these rules, one can predict the expected yield outcome for a given modifier based on its structural features.
- The rules cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, ensuring high coverage while maintaining specificity.
- They balance simplicity and complexity, providing straightforward criteria (e.g., presence of specific functional groups) and combining multiple features for more nuanced predictions.

**Conclusion:**

These rules serve as a useful guide for designing or selecting molecular modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction. Considering the coordination chemistry, electronic effects, and structural characteristics of the modifiers allows for rational decision-making in the reaction optimization process.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and unambiguous in distinguishing high and low yield modifiers based on α-amino acids with specific side chains. It provides good property insight by linking acidic or nitrogenous side chains to enhanced metal coordination, which positively affects the yield. The rule combines sub-structures (α-amino acid core with side chain variations), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points, ensuring good coverage and a balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly identifies high and low yield modifiers based on the presence of electron-withdrawing or coordinating para substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids. It provides property insight into how these substituents influence metal coordination and, consequently, the yield. The rule considers combinations of structural features—aromatic carboxylic acid core with specific substituents—fulfilling the complexity criterion. Supported by multiple data points, it offers good coverage and a balanced approach.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in defining high yield modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles and notes exceptions due to steric hindrance when attached via another aromatic ring. It offers property insight into how nitrogen heterocycles contribute to metal coordination and the effect of steric factors. The rule combines sub-structures and considers steric hindrance, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by several data points, ensuring adequate coverage and balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 specifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yield, while those with longer chains or fewer hydroxyls yield low yield. It provides property insight into how multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination with the metal center. The rule combines chain length and the number of hydroxyl groups, fulfilling the complexity criterion. With supporting data points, it has good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly differentiates between modifiers with aliphatic and aromatic thiol groups regarding their effect on yield. It provides property insight into how the context of the thiol group influences coordination behavior with the metal center. Although the rule is simpler, it considers the type of thiol group and its aromatic or aliphatic nature, meeting the complexity criterion. With two supporting data points, it has minimal but sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 distinctly defines high and low yield modifiers based on chain length and the presence of amino groups in aliphatic carboxylic acids. It provides property insight into the effects of chain length on solubility and coordination efficiency. The rule combines chain length and functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. Supported by multiple data points, it offers adequate coverage and a balanced approach.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly identifies that modifiers with flexible ether linkages in aliphatic chains tend to yield low yield due to decreased effective coordination caused by increased conformational freedom. It offers property insight into how molecular flexibility affects coordination with the metal center. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures involving ether linkages, meeting the complexity criterion. With two data points, coverage is minimal but acceptable given the rule's specificity.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly states that modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains yield low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects that hinder metal coordination. It provides property insight into how electron-withdrawing groups affect coordination. However, the rule is based on a single data point, which does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two supporting data points. Therefore, its validity is questionable due to insufficient data support.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 suggests that modifiers with chelating groups in rigid ring systems yield high yield due to effective stabilization of the metal center. While this provides property insight, the rule is supported by only one data point, failing the coverage criterion. The clarity could be improved by specifying the types of chelating groups and rigid ring systems involved. Overall, insufficient data support reduces the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly identifies that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups on aromatic rings yield low yield due to potential side reactions and blockage of metal coordination sites. It provides reasonable property insight into how these functional groups can negatively affect the reaction. The rule considers the combination of an aromatic ring with specific functional groups, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by two data points, meeting the minimum coverage requirement.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield low yield by reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination. However, the provided example **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** is recorded as yielding high yield in the dataset, which contradicts the rule. This inconsistency undermines the clarity and validity of the rule. Furthermore, the rule is supported by only one data point, failing the coverage criterion. Therefore, the rule is invalid due to conflicting evidence and insufficient data support.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly defines high yield modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with flexible aliphatic extensions of optimal length and polar functional groups, enhancing coordination with the metal center. It provides property insight into how these structural features influence yield. The rule combines multiple sub-structures, meeting the complexity criterion. With two data points, coverage is minimal but acceptable, maintaining a balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly states that modifiers with long aliphatic chains lacking additional coordinating functional groups yield low yield due to decreased solubility and poor interaction with the catalyst. It provides property insight into how chain length and absence of functional groups affect the reaction outcome. Although the rule is relatively simple, it covers multiple data points, satisfying the coverage criterion and maintaining a balance between simplicity and coverage.

These rules have been generated considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the reaction yield. They illustrate direct combinations of functional groups in the modifiers and their impact on the catalytic activity, enabling prediction of high or low yield for any structure fitting the descriptions.

**Key Factors Influencing Yield:**

1. **Coordination Ability with Metal Center**:
   - **High Yield**: Presence of additional nitrogen donor atoms, multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups, aliphatic thiol groups, and chelating groups in rigid ring systems enhance coordination (Rules 1, 3, 4, 7, 11).
   - **Low Yield**: Modifiers lacking sufficient coordination sites or having competing functional groups reduce catalyst effectiveness (Rules 5, 8, 10).

2. **Electronic Effects**:
   - **High Yield**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and coordination potential (Rule 2).
   - **Low Yield**: Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability (Rule 9).

3. **Steric Hindrance**:
   - **High Yield**: Modifiers with minimal steric bulk near coordinating sites promote effective interaction (Rules 1, 3).
   - **Low Yield**: Bulky side chains or additional rings hinder coordination (Rule 6).

4. **Functional Group Interference**:
   - **Low Yield**: Additional carbonyl groups on aromatic rings can compete with the carboxylic acid for metal coordination (Rule 8).

5. **Molecular Flexibility**:
   - **High Yield**: Rigid structures promote effective chelation (Rule 11).
   - **Low Yield**: Flexible ether linkages decrease coordination efficiency (Rule 5).

**Conclusion:**

These refined rules serve as a practical guide for predicting and optimizing the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering the combination of functional groups and the underlying physicochemical properties, researchers can make informed decisions when selecting or designing molecular modifiers to enhance reaction outcomes.

These rules have been carefully formulated, considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple functional groups, enhancing predictive power for the dataset. By applying these rules, one can predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features.

**Key Factors Influencing Yield:**

1. **Coordination Ability with Metal Center**:
   - **High Yield**: Presence of multiple donor atoms (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups) in proximity to the carboxylic acid enhances chelation and stabilizes the catalyst (Rules 1, 2, 3, 6, 11).
   - **Low Yield**: Absence of donor groups, or donor groups that are distant or part of interfering functionalities, reduce effective coordination (Rules 5, 8, 9, 10, 14).

2. **Electronic Effects**:
   - **High Yield**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and promote metal coordination by making the carboxylic acid more electrophilic (Rule 4).
   - **Low Yield**: Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and hinder coordination (Rule 5).

3. **Steric Hindrance and Molecular Flexibility**:
   - **High Yield**: Rigid structures and minimal steric hindrance facilitate effective metal-binding (Rules 2, 11).
   - **Low Yield**: Bulky side chains and flexible linkages can impede coordination due to steric and conformational effects (Rules 7, 8, 12).

4. **Functional Group Interference**:
   - **Low Yield**: Additional functional groups like amides or carbonyls can compete with carboxylic acids for metal coordination or reduce donor ability through resonance (Rules 9, 13, 14).

5. **Specific Functional Groups**:
   - **High Yield**: Aliphatic thiol groups (Rule 3) and nitrogen heterocycles in close proximity to the carboxyl group (Rule 6) enhance metal coordination.
   - **Low Yield**: Thioether groups and distant hydroxyl or amino groups are less effective in coordination (Rules 10, 13).

**Conclusion:**

These refined rules offer a robust framework for predicting the impact of molecular modifiers on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By understanding and applying these rules, researchers can design and select modifiers that enhance catalytic performance, leading to optimized reaction conditions and improved yields.
