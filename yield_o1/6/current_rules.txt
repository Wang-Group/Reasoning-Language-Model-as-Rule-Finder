- **Low Yield Example**:
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Aromatic thiol)

---

**Rule 4: Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid and Electron-Withdrawing Groups on Aromatic Rings**

- **Description**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with **electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro, halogens, formyl) on the ring, especially at the **para position**, yield a **high** value of yield. These groups increase the acidity and electrophilicity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing **metal coordination**.

- **High Yield Examples**:

---

**Rule 7: Modifiers with Bulky Hydrophobic Side Chains Yielding Variable Yields**

- **Description**: Modifiers with **bulky hydrophobic side chains**, such as **aromatic rings**, may yield either **high** or **low** yields depending on the presence of additional coordinating groups. If **additional donor atoms** (e.g., amino groups) are present, they can **overcome steric hindrance** and enhance yield.

- **High Yield Example**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan derivative with an amino group)

- **Low Yield Example**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine derivative without additional coordinating groups)

---

**Rule 8: Modifiers with Flexible Ether Linkages in Aliphatic Chains Yielding Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that have a **carboxylic acid group** and **flexible ether linkages** (–O–) within aliphatic chains yield a **low** value of yield. The increased **conformational flexibility** hinders effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Low Yield Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

**Rule 9: Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid and Additional Carbonyl Groups Leading to Competing Coordination Yielding Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that have a **carboxylic acid group** and additional **carbonyl groups** (e.g., aldehyde, ketone) on the same molecule may yield a **low** value of yield. The additional carbonyl can **compete** for metal binding, disrupting catalyst activity.

- **Low Yield Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

**Rule 10: Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Donor Groups Yielding Low Yield**

- **Description**: Straight-chain **aliphatic carboxylic acids** lacking additional **donor functional groups** (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups) in close proximity to the carboxyl group yield a **low** value of yield. The absence of effective coordination sites limits interaction with the metal center.

- **Low Yield Examples**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from carboxyl group)
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

**Rule 11: Modifiers with Chelating Groups in Rigid Ring Systems Yielding High Yield**

  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

**Rule 12: Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid and Electron-Withdrawing Fluoroalkyl or Sulfonyl Groups Yielding Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers that have a **carboxylic acid group** and additional **fluoroalkyl** or **sulfonyl groups** yield a **low** value of yield despite their electron-withdrawing nature. These groups can introduce **steric hindrance** or unfavorable interactions, reducing catalyst efficiency.

- **Low Yield Examples**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

**Rule 13: Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid and Thioether Groups Yielding Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and a **thioether group** (–S–R) yield a **low** value of yield. Unlike thiols, thioethers have a reduced ability to coordinate with metal centers, diminishing catalytic activity.

- **Low Yield Example**:
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

**Rule 14: Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid and Adjacent Amide Groups Yielding Low Yield**

- **Description**: Modifiers where the **carboxylic acid group** is adjacent to an **amide group** tend to yield a **low** value of yield. The **amide linkage** can interfere with coordination due to resonance stabilization, reducing its effectiveness as a donor site.

- **Low Yield Examples**:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully formulated, considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple functional groups, enhancing predictive power for the dataset. By applying these rules, one can predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features.

**Key Factors Influencing Yield:**

1. **Coordination Ability with Metal Center**:
   - **High Yield**: Presence of multiple donor atoms (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups) in proximity to the carboxylic acid enhances chelation and stabilizes the catalyst (Rules 1, 2, 3, 6, 11).
   - **Low Yield**: Absence of donor groups, or donor groups that are distant or part of interfering functionalities, reduce effective coordination (Rules 5, 8, 9, 10, 14).

2. **Electronic Effects**:
   - **High Yield**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and promote metal coordination by making the carboxylic acid more electrophilic (Rule 4).
   - **Low Yield**: Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and hinder coordination (Rule 5).

3. **Steric Hindrance and Molecular Flexibility**:
   - **High Yield**: Rigid structures and minimal steric hindrance facilitate effective metal-binding (Rules 2, 11).
   - **Low Yield**: Bulky side chains and flexible linkages can impede coordination due to steric and conformational effects (Rules 7, 8, 12).

4. **Functional Group Interference**:
   - **Low Yield**: Additional functional groups like amides or carbonyls can compete with carboxylic acids for metal coordination or reduce donor ability through resonance (Rules 9, 13, 14).

5. **Specific Functional Groups**:
   - **High Yield**: Aliphatic thiol groups (Rule 3) and nitrogen heterocycles in close proximity to the carboxyl group (Rule 6) enhance metal coordination.
   - **Low Yield**: Thioether groups and distant hydroxyl or amino groups are less effective in coordination (Rules 10, 13).

**Conclusion:**

These refined rules offer a robust framework for predicting the impact of molecular modifiers on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By understanding and applying these rules, researchers can design and select modifiers that enhance catalytic performance, leading to optimized reaction conditions and improved yields.
