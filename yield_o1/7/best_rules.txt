**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with additional carboxylate groups in their side chains**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids containing an **amino group (-NH₂)** and two **carboxylic acid groups (-COOH)**—one on the α-carbon and one on the side chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of multiple carboxylate groups allows for **multidentate coordination** with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stabilization and activity, leading to higher yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) at the para position**, such as **4-aminobenzoic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: A benzene ring with a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **amino group (-NH₂)** directly opposite (para) to it.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The amino group can act as an additional **coordination site**, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)** groups, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings bearing a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **electron-withdrawing group** at the para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the **acidity** of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center, thereby improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **electron-donating group** at the para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-donating substituents decrease the **acidity** of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal center, which reduces catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids**, such as **pyridinecarboxylic acids** and **pyrazolecarboxylic acids**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Heteroaromatic rings with one or more **nitrogen atoms** and a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms provide additional **coordination sites** for metal binding, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and stabilizing the catalyst's active form.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **thiol groups (-SH) on aliphatic chains** tend to result in **high yield**, while those with **thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a **thiol group (-SH)** on the side chain.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with a **thiol group (-SH)** attached directly to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Thiol groups on aliphatic chains can coordinate effectively with the metal without causing catalyst poisoning.
    - **Low Yield**: Thiol groups on aromatic rings may bind too strongly to the metal center, **blocking active sites** and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups**, such as **octanoic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Straight-chain aliphatic acids containing only a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The absence of additional functional groups reduces **steric hindrance** and avoids competing interactions, allowing the carboxyl group to coordinate effectively with the metal center.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional polar functional groups**, such as **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains of seven carbons or more with **polar functional groups** besides the **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Additional polar groups can cause **steric hindrance** and **unfavorable intramolecular interactions**, hindering effective coordination between the carboxyl group and the metal center.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde (-CHO)** or **ketone (>C=O)** groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids with **carbonyl groups** (aldehyde or ketone) near the **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Proximity of additional carbonyl groups may lead to **unwanted side reactions** or formation of **stable chelate rings** with the metal center, altering the catalyst's activity and decreasing the yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages (-O-)** or **polyether chains** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids with **ether bonds** in their structure, creating flexible, **polar polyether chains**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms may interfere with coordination between the carboxyl group and the metal center. Increased flexibility and polarity can reduce effective interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those with **non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains**, such as **phenylalanine**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., indole ring).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **non-nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., benzene ring).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen atoms in the side chain provide additional **coordination sites**, enhancing metal binding and catalyst activity.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of extra coordination sites results in weaker metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **N-acetylated amino groups** or **blocked amino groups** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group is acylated or modified**, forming an **amide bond**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Blocking the amino group reduces the number of available **coordination sites**, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids**, particularly those with multiple **fluorine atoms**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a high degree of **fluorination** along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine increases the acidity of the carboxylic acid but may also enhance **hydrophobicity** and decrease **solubility** in the reaction medium. Altered electronic properties can disrupt effective coordination with the metal catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **amide linkages** or **peptide-like structures** tend to result in **low yield** due to competing interactions and reduced coordination.

  - **Chemical Features**: Compounds containing **amide bonds** or resembling **peptides**, with **multiple functional groups**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: **Intramolecular hydrogen bonding** and **conformational constraints** from amide linkages may reduce the availability of coordination sites. Multiple functional groups might compete for metal binding, disrupting effective catalyst-modifier interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines multiple functional groups and considers their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.---------------------------------------------------------------
