**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups (-COOH)**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules containing an **α-amino group (-NH₂)** attached to the central (alpha) carbon and at least one additional **carboxyl group (-COOH)** on the side chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of multiple carboxyl groups allows for **chelation** with metal ions, forming stable complexes through **bidentate coordination**. This enhances the catalyst's stability and activity by creating strong metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic Acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic Acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**; those with additional polar groups along the chain result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Straight-chain aliphatic acids with a **terminal carboxyl group (-COOH)** and no other substituents.
    - **Low Yield**: Aliphatic acids with **hydroxyl (-OH)**, **amino (-NH₂)**, or other polar groups along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Unsubstituted chains allow for **flexible coordination** with metal centers and minimize steric hindrance, facilitating effective binding.
    - **Low Yield**: Polar groups introduce **steric hindrance** or may **interfere with metal coordination**, disrupting optimal interactions.

  - **Examples**:

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups (EDGs) result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and a strong **EWG** (e.g., **nitro (-NO₂)**, **halogens**) at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxyl group** and an **EDG** (e.g., **methyl (-CH₃)**, **hydroxyl (-OH)**, **methoxy (-OCH₃)**) at the para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: EWGs increase the **acidity** of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge on the conjugate base, enhancing its ability to **coordinate** with metal ions.
    - **Low Yield**: EDGs decrease acidity by donating electron density, weakening metal-ligand coordination due to reduced ability to stabilize negative charges.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids without bulky substituents** result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules featuring a **nitrogenous heteroaromatic ring** (e.g., **pyridine**, **pyrazole**) with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and minimal additional substituents.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional **coordination sites**, enhancing metal-ligand binding through **donor-acceptor interactions**. This stabilizes the catalyst by forming strong complexes with metal ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic Acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains** result in **high yield**; those with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains result in **low yield**.

    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **non-nitrogenous aromatics** (e.g., **phenyl ring** in phenylalanine).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: The nitrogen in the side chain provides additional **coordination sites**, enhancing metal binding and catalyst activity.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of extra coordination sites leads to weaker metal-ligand interactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

    - **High Yield**: Thiol groups on aliphatic chains can form beneficial **soft-soft interactions** with metal ions without causing catalyst poisoning.
    - **Low Yield**: Thiol groups on aromatic rings may bind too strongly or irreversibly to metal centers, leading to **catalyst deactivation**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic acids where multiple hydrogens are replaced with **fluorine atoms**, significantly increasing the fluorine content.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: High fluorination increases **hydrophobicity** and exerts a strong **electron-withdrawing inductive effect**, reducing electron density on the carboxylate oxygen and hindering effective metal coordination.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic Acid)

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **acylated amino acids (amide derivatives)** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group (-NH₂)** is modified into an **amide group (-CONH-)**, such as through **acetylation** or peptide bond formation.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with **methoxy substituents**, a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**, and additional **carbonyl groups** (e.g., ketones) in the side chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Methoxy groups can **activate** the aromatic ring toward coordination, while additional carbonyl groups provide extra **coordination sites**. This enhances metal-ligand interactions and stabilizes the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with keto groups** result in **low yield**.
