Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Merge rules with similar structural features to increase coverage.** For example, combine Rules 1 and 10, which both involve SH (mercapto) groups but differ in the ring attachment, to form a broader rule about SH groups' influence on yield. This will enhance coverage and simplify the rule set.

- **Advice 2**: **Re-evaluate rules supported by only one data point and consider modifying or removing them.** Rules like 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, and 15 have low coverage. Assess whether these rules can be merged with others or need additional data for validation.

- **Advice 3**: **Address conflicting data points to refine rules.** For instance, Rule 15 states that modifiers with keto groups on aliphatic chains result in low yield, but 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid, which has a keto group, shows high yield. Refine Rule 15 by specifying the context or combining it with other structural features that influence yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Increase data coverage for low-support rules by seeking additional examples.** Experimental or literature data can help confirm the validity of rules with limited support and improve their reliability.

- **Advice 5**: **Prioritize and expand rules with strong support and clear property insights.** Focus on rules like 2, 5, 7, 11, and 13, which are supported by multiple data points and have logical chemical rationale. Expanding these rules can improve the overall predictive power of the rule set.

- **Advice 6**: **Generalize rules where possible to cover more data points without losing specificity.** For example, combine Rules 4 and 9 by creating a rule about the effect of electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methyl) on aromatic rings para to carboxylic acid groups, specifying when they lead to high or low yield based on additional substituents.

- **Advice 7**: **Add more examples to rules to illustrate applicability and enhance clarity.** Including more data points in each rule helps users understand the scope and limitations, making the rules more practical.

- **Advice 8**: **Ensure consistency and avoid contradictions between rules by reviewing the physicochemical rationale.** Cross-check rules for overlapping or conflicting criteria and adjust them to maintain a cohesive and logical rule set.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate structural context into rules to improve specificity.** For example, refine Rule 15 to specify that keto groups on aliphatic chains without adjacent aromatic rings or electron-donating groups tend to result in low yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Consider removing or consolidating rules with minimal impact on predictions.** Simplifying the rule set by eliminating redundant or weak rules can make it more user-friendly and focused on the most significant predictors of yield.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Reframe the current rules to focus on specific, countable functional groups and structural features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "amino acids with side-chain carboxylate groups," specify rules based on the **number of carboxylate groups**, **presence of amino groups**, and **chain length**, which can be numerically quantified.

- **Advice 2**: Develop rules that utilize computable molecular descriptors, such as **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**, **LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient)**, **molecular weight**, and **number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors**. These descriptors can be easily derived from SMILES and used to create a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: Combine and generalize similar rules to reduce complexity and redundancy. For instance, create a single rule that encompasses modifiers with **aromatic rings substituted with electron-donating groups** tend to result in **high yield**, which covers rules involving amino, hydroxyl, and methoxy substitutions.

- **Advice 4**: Introduce rules based on **quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR)** parameters. For example, establish thresholds for **Lipinski's Rule of Five** parameters that correlate with high or low yields, facilitating numerical analysis.

- **Advice 5**: Utilize substructure fingerprinting methods to identify and encode the presence of specific functional groups or motifs (e.g., **SMARTS patterns**). This allows for the conversion of structural features into binary or count-based numeric features.

- **Advice 6**: Incorporate rules that consider **steric hindrance** and **electronic effects** numerically, such as the **Taft steric parameter** or **Hammett sigma constants**, which can be assigned to substituents present in the modifiers.

- **Advice 7**: Create a scoring system where each modifier is evaluated based on the **presence or absence of key features** identified from the data (e.g., +1 for each carboxylate group, -1 for each fluorine atom), resulting in an overall score that correlates with yield.

- **Advice 8**: Use machine learning techniques to analyze the dataset and identify **statistically significant features** that influence yield. The insights gained can be translated into new rules that are both practical and numerically quantifiable.

- **Advice 9**: Standardize the representation of chemical structures using SMILES and ensure consistency in the dataset to facilitate automated feature extraction and numerical encoding.

- **Advice 10**: Include rules that account for **alkyl chain length** and **branching**, using numerical values for the number of carbon atoms and branching points, as these can influence solubility and reactivity.

These rules have been formulated by analyzing the dataset and identifying patterns between the molecular features of the modifiers and their influence on the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures where possible and considers underlying physical-chemical properties, such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, and coordination abilities with the catalyst.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction based on its structural features.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 addresses modifiers with acylated amino groups resulting in low yield and provides some **property insight**. However, it is based on only **one data point** ((2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), failing the **coverage** requirement. The limited data support reduces the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 indicates that modifiers with aromatic rings containing methoxy groups have variable yields, suggesting the need for case-by-case analysis. While it provides **property insight** into electron-donating effects, the rule lacks **clarity** due to its non-definitive nature and may be too **complex** without offering clear guidance. The **coverage** is minimal, with only two examples showing opposite yields, making it less effective as a predictive rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 suggests that modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids on aliphatic chains lead to low yield. It provides **property insight** into potential side reactions involving ketone groups. However, it is supported by only **one data point** (4-oxoheptanedioic acid), failing the **coverage** criterion. Additionally, there is a potential contradiction with a high-yield data point (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) that contains a similar functional group, which affects the **clarity** and reliability of the rule.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Merge Rules with Low Coverage to Enhance Reliability**

  Rules that are supported by only one data point, such as **Rule 2** (amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains), **Rule 3** (modifiers containing a thiol group on an aliphatic chain), **Rule 6** (modifiers containing a thiol group on an aromatic ring), **Rule 8** (modifiers with heavily fluorinated aliphatic chains), and **Rule 13** (modifiers containing acylated amino groups), have low coverage and may not be sufficiently reliable on their own. To improve these rules:

  - **Combine similar rules** where possible. For example, merge **Rule 2** and **Rule 12** into a broader rule about amino acids with aromatic side chains, specifying conditions under which they lead to high or low yields based on additional functional groups or electronic properties.
  - **Broaden the scope** of rules by identifying common structural features that influence yield, increasing the number of supporting data points.
  - **Remove or revise rules** that cannot be supported by additional data to maintain the overall reliability of the rule set.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rules with Conflicting Data or Exceptions**

  Rules that have exceptions or are contradicted by certain data points need to be refined for clarity and accuracy. For instance:

  - **Rule 12** cites phenylalanine, which has an aromatic side chain, as an example of an amino acid with a non-polar, aliphatic side chain. This contradiction needs correction. Revise the rule to accurately reflect the data or choose appropriate examples.
  - **Rule 14** notes variable yields with methoxy-substituted aromatic rings. Since methoxy groups are electron-donating, clarify under what conditions they lead to high or low yields by considering the influence of other substituents or the position of the methoxy groups.
  - **Rule 15** conflicts with data showing both high and low yields for modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids. Refine the rule by specifying additional structural features or contextual factors that determine the yield outcome.

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance Clarity and Specificity in Rule Definitions**

  To improve the usability of the rules:

  - **Provide precise chemical descriptions**. Ensure that each rule includes clear structural criteria that can be unambiguously identified from the modifier's structure.
  - **Include more examples** for each rule to illustrate the range of compounds it covers, enhancing comprehension and applicability.
  - **Explain exceptions** where they occur, offering insights into why certain compounds might not follow the general trend specified by the rule.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Additional Data to Strengthen Rules**

  For rules with limited data support:

  - **Expand the dataset** by including more experimental results for modifiers that fit the criteria of underrepresented rules. This will improve the statistical significance and reliability of the rules.
  - **Perform targeted experiments** to test specific modifiers that could either support or challenge existing rules, helping to refine them further.

- **Advice 5**: **Consider Electronic and Steric Effects in Greater Depth**

  To enhance the predictive power of the rules:

  - **Analyze substituent effects** more thoroughly by considering both inductive and resonance effects of functional groups on the aromatic ring or aliphatic chain.
  - **Assess steric hindrance** introduced by bulky groups, which may affect the catalyst's ability to interact with the substrate, influencing the yield.
  - **Modify rules** to account for these effects, such as adjusting **Rule 11** to include other electron-donating groups besides methyl and specifying their impact on yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Integrate Physical-Chemical Properties into Rules**

  Strengthen the connection between structural features and their underlying physical-chemical properties:

  - **Quantify properties** like electron density, steric parameters, and coordination ability where possible, integrating these into the rules to provide a more nuanced prediction model.
  - **Use computational tools** to model interactions between modifiers and the catalyst, supporting the development of more accurate and insightful rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**

  Rules that are too complex may hinder practical application:

  - **Reevaluate rules with multiple conditions** to determine if they can be simplified without losing predictive power.
  - **Focus on key structural features** that have the most significant impact on yield, streamlining the rules for ease of use.

- **Advice 8**: **Ensure Consistency Across Rules**

  To prevent overlap and contradictions:

  - **Review all rules collectively** to identify and eliminate redundancies or conflicts between them.
  - **Standardize terminology and criteria** used in the rules to maintain consistency and clarity throughout the rule set.

- **Advice 9**: **Update Rules Based on New Insights**

  As more data becomes available or new patterns are observed:

  - **Continuously refine the rules** to incorporate the latest findings, ensuring that the rule set remains current and effective.
  - **Engage in periodic reviews** of the rules to assess their performance and make adjustments as necessary.

  - *Example*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with non-polar, aliphatic side chains** tend to result in **low yield**.
  - *Chemical Features*: α-Amino acids with side chains that are non-polar and aliphatic, lacking additional functional groups.
  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Lack of functional groups in side chains reduces the ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Example*:
    - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **acylated amino groups**, such as **acetamido groups**, tend to result in **low yield**.
  - *Chemical Features*: Presence of an acetamido group or N-acetylation on an amino group.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been formulated by analyzing the dataset and identifying patterns between the molecular features of the modifiers and their influence on the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures where possible and considers underlying physical-chemical properties, such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, and coordination abilities with the catalyst.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction based on its structural features.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Improve the specificity of SMARTS patterns for Rule 1**. The current SMARTS patterns for Rule 1 (`amino_acid_backbone` and `carboxylic_acid`) are too general and will match any amino acid because the backbone includes a carboxylic acid group. To specifically identify amino acids with **side-chain carboxylate groups**, modify the pattern to detect an additional carboxylic acid group attached to the side chain. For example, use a pattern that looks for a carboxylic acid group separated by a specific number of bonds from the α-carbon or the amino group. Alternatively, define a side-chain pattern that includes the carboxylate functionality, such as `[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1][CX4][CX4][NX3][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Enhance the pattern for Rule 2 to match heteroaromatic side chains accurately**. The current pattern for a heteroaromatic ring (`'[n,o,s]1cccc1'`) might not capture all relevant heteroaromatic rings, especially those fused with other rings like in tryptophan. Modify the SMARTS pattern to detect heteroaromatic rings attached to the amino acid backbone, considering fused ring systems. For example, use a pattern like `[NX3][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` connected to a heteroaromatic ring, such as `[c,n,o,s]1[c,n,o,s][c,n,o,s][c,n,o,s][c,n,o,s][c,n,o,s]1`.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine Rule 3 to specifically detect thiol groups on aliphatic chains attached to a carboxylic acid**. The pattern `[thiol_group, carboxylic_acid]` is too general and might capture thiols and carboxylic acids anywhere in the molecule, not necessarily connected via an aliphatic chain. Modify the pattern to ensure that the thiol and carboxylic acid are connected through an aliphatic chain. For example, use a pattern like `*[CH2][CH2][SX2H]` attached to a carboxylic acid group `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Correct the pattern for Rule 4 to accurately match pyridine carboxylic acids**. The current pattern `'n1ccccc1C(=O)[O,H]'` may not correctly match pyridine rings directly attached to a carboxylic acid. Ensure that the nitrogen is in the ring and the carboxylic acid is attached directly to the ring. Use an accurate pattern like `c1ccncc1C(=O)[OX2H1]` or `[n]1cccc([C](=O)[OX2H1])c1`.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Modify Rule 5 to detect para-substituted aromatic rings with hydrogen-bonding groups accurately**. The simplified pattern `[c][c](Nc)[c][c](C(=O)O)[c]` may not reliably capture all such structures. Use a more general pattern that detects aromatic rings with a hydrogen-bonding substituent (e.g., amino or nitro) para to a carboxylic acid. For example, use `c1ccc(cc1[NH2,$([N+](=O)[O-])])C(=O)[OX2H1]` where the substituent is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Adjust Rule 6 to correctly match thiol groups on aromatic rings**. The pattern `'[c][c][c][c][c][c][SX2H]'` assumes a specific ring size and substitution pattern. Instead, use a pattern that detects an aromatic ring with a thiol group attached, such as `c1ccc(cc1)[SX2H]`.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Refine Rule 7 to detect aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings**. The current pattern `'[c][c][c][c][c][c][CX3H](=O)'` may not match all aromatic aldehydes. Use a pattern like `c1ccc(cc1)C=O` to capture aldehyde groups directly attached to an aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Improve Rule 8 to detect heavily fluorinated aliphatic chains**. The pattern `'[CF](F)(F)'` only matches trifluoromethyl groups, which may not be sufficient. To detect heavily fluorinated chains, use a pattern that matches multiple adjacent fluorinated carbons, such as `C(F)(F)[C,F](F)F` or `C([C,F])([F])([F])[C,F]([F])[F]`.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Modify Rule 9 to accurately identify long aliphatic chains (>6 carbons) with amino groups**. The pattern `[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]` (six CH2 units) may match any long chain but doesn't consider the amino group. Ensure that the amino group is connected to a chain longer than six carbons. Use a pattern like `C(CCCN)[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]C(=O)O`.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Enhance Rule 10 to detect multiple ethoxy or methoxyethoxy groups**. The current patterns `[OX2][CX2][CX2][OX2][CX3]` (ethoxy group) and `[OX2][CX4H3]` (methoxy group) may not capture multiple occurrences. Use patterns that look for multiple repetitions, such as `([CX2][OX2]){2,}` to detect two or more ethoxy units.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Correct Rule 11 to detect para-methyl-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids**. The pattern `[c][c](C)[c][c](C(=O)O)[c]` may not match all relevant structures. Use a pattern like `c1ccc(cc1C)C(=O)O` where the methyl group is para to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Refine Rule 12 to specifically detect amino acids with non-polar, aliphatic side chains**. The pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4]` is too general and may match any aliphatic chain. Combine the amino acid backbone pattern with a side chain that lacks polar functional groups. For example, use `[NX3][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][CX4][CX4]`.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Improve Rule 13 to detect acylated amino groups accurately**. The pattern `[NX3][CX3](=O)[CX4H3]` may not match all acylated amines. Use a pattern like `[NX3][CX3](=O)[#6]` to detect amino groups acylated with any acyl group, not just acetyl.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Adjust Rule 14 to capture aromatic rings with methoxy groups**. The pattern `[c][c](OC)[c][c](C(=O)O)[c]` might be too restrictive. Use a more general pattern like `c1cc(OC)ccc1C(=O)O` to detect methoxy-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Refine Rule 15 to detect ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids on aliphatic chains**. The current pattern `[CX3](=O)[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` may not accurately capture the described structure. Use a pattern like `O=CCCCC(=O)O` where the ketone is adjacent to the aliphatic chain leading to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 16**: **Ensure that SMARTS patterns are appropriately specific and consider molecular context**. Many current patterns might match functional groups anywhere in the molecule. Use SMARTS patterns that take into account the connectivity and relative positions of functional groups to ensure accurate matches.

- **Suggestion 17**: **Test SMARTS patterns individually using known positive and negative examples**. Before applying the patterns to the entire dataset, verify each pattern against molecules that should match (from the examples provided in the rules) and those that should not, adjusting the patterns as needed.

- **Suggestion 18**: **Use recursive SMARTS or atom map numbers to relate substructures**. For complex rules that depend on the relationship between different parts of the molecule (e.g., a substituent at the para position relative to another group), consider using more advanced SMARTS features like recursive SMARTS (`$(...)`) or atom map numbers to accurately capture these relationships.

- **Suggestion 19**: **Include error handling for molecules that cannot be parsed**. In the code, when a molecule cannot be parsed (`mol is None`), consider logging this event or reviewing the SMILES notation for errors, rather than silently adding a row of zeros.

- **Suggestion 20**: **Improve comments and documentation in the code**. Provide clearer explanations of what each SMARTS pattern is intended to detect and how it relates to the chemical features described in the natural language rules. This will facilitate future modifications and troubleshooting.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

**1. Comparison with Reference Metrics**

- **Train Support**:
  - *Previous*: [0.1667, 0.1845]
  - *Current*: 0.0248
  - *Analysis*: The current train support has significantly decreased compared to the previous metrics. The previous rules applied to approximately 16.67% to 18.45% of the training data, whereas the current rules cover only about 2.48%. This indicates that the current set of rules is applicable to a much smaller portion of the dataset.

- **Train Confidence**:
  - *Previous*: [0.6352, 0.5396]
  - *Current*: 0.6733
  - *Analysis*: There is an improvement in train confidence from the previous average values. The current confidence of 67.33% indicates that when the rule conditions are met, there is a 67.33% chance that the prediction is correct. This suggests that the accuracy of the rules when they apply has improved.

- **Train Lift**:
  - *Previous*: [1.2048, 1.0559]
  - *Current*: 1.3364
  - *Analysis*: The lift has increased compared to previous values. A lift of 1.3364 means that the rule is 33.64% better at predicting the outcome than random chance, indicating a stronger association between the rule conditions and the prediction.

- **Train Leverage**:
  - *Previous*: [0.0289, -0.0041]
  - *Current*: 0.0076
  - *Analysis*: The current leverage is positive, which is favorable, but it has decreased compared to the higher previous positive value. This suggests that while the rules are contributing additional support over chance, the magnitude of this contribution is less than before.

**2. Insights from Metrics**

- **Trade-off Between Support and Confidence**:
  - The increase in confidence and lift suggests that the rules are becoming more accurate when they apply. However, the significant decrease in support indicates that these rules are applicable to fewer cases in the dataset.
  - This trade-off implies that the current rules are more specialized, capturing niche patterns that lead to correct predictions but missing out on broader applicability.

- **Potential Overfitting**:
  - The high confidence and lift on a small support may indicate overfitting to specific patterns in the training data. This could result in rules that perform well on the training set but may not generalize to new, unseen data.

**3. Determination of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum Assessment**:
  - The current increase in confidence and lift, coupled with the decrease in support, suggests that the optimization process may have reached a local minimum focused on maximizing confidence at the expense of support.
  - Since the support is quite low, it is likely that the algorithm is honing in on very specific combinations of features that are not broadly applicable.

- **Iteration Sufficiency**:
  - Given the current metrics, it appears that further iterations are necessary. Additional iterations could help explore the solution space for rules that maintain high confidence and lift while improving support.
  - Balancing these metrics is crucial for developing robust rules that are both accurate and widely applicable.

**4. Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

- **Increase Rule Generality**:
  - **Merge Similar Rules**: Identify rules that have overlapping chemical features or underlying properties and consider merging them to create more general rules that apply to a larger portion of the dataset.
  - **Example**: Rules 1 and 2 both deal with amino acids but focus on different side chains. Combining these rules into a broader rule about amino acids with functionalized side chains could increase support.

- **Optimize Feature Selection**:
  - **Identify Key Functional Groups**: Focus on functional groups that contribute significantly to high yield without being overly specific.
  - **Example**: Instead of specifying exact positions or specific substituents, generalize to functional groups capable of forming favorable interactions, such as hydrogen bonds or coordination bonds.

- **Balance Specificity and Generality**:
  - **Adjust Rule Conditions**: Introduce flexibility in the rule conditions to encompass a wider range of compounds while retaining predictive power.
  - **Example**: Rather than limiting to "modifiers with thiol groups on an aliphatic chain attached to a carboxylic acid," consider "modifiers with sulfur-containing groups capable of metal coordination."

- **Incorporate Statistical Validation**:
  - **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data and are not just fitting noise in the training set.
  - **Evaluation on Test Set**: Since test metrics are not provided, evaluating the current rules on a separate test set would offer insights into their generalizability.

- **Refine Low-Yield Rules**:
  - **Analyze Exceptions**: For rules predicting low yield, investigate any exceptions where modifiers with those features resulted in high yield to understand context-dependent factors.
  - **Adjust Accordingly**: Modify the rules to account for these exceptions, potentially improving confidence without sacrificing support.

- **Iterative Rule Development**:
  - **Feedback Loop**: Use insights from the analysis to refine the rules iteratively, testing the impact of each change on the metrics.
  - **Monitor Metrics**: Aim to gradually increase support while maintaining or slightly compromising on confidence and lift to achieve a better balance.

**5. Conclusion**

The current rules demonstrate high confidence and lift, indicating strong predictive power when they apply. However, the low support suggests that they are too narrowly focused and do not cover enough of the dataset to be practical for broader application. 

To improve the rules:

- **Seek a Balance**: Aim for a balance between specificity (confidence and lift) and coverage (support).
- **Generalize Strategically**: Broaden the rules without significantly compromising accuracy.
- **Continue Iterations**: Further iterations and refinements are necessary to enhance the applicability of the rules.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be improved to provide reliable predictions across a larger subset of the dataset, enhancing their utility in the research program.

ML Commenter Message:
**Comments on Accuracies of the Validation Set and Train Set:**

Upon reviewing the current and previous accuracies, it is evident that there is a significant decrease in the model's performance in the current iteration.

- **Previous Reference Accuracies:**
  - Validation Accuracies were consistently around **76%**.
  - Test Accuracies ranged from **62.5% to 75%**.
- **Current Iteration Accuracy:**
  - An overall accuracy of **60%** was obtained using the classification model.

**Analysis:**

- The reduction from a consistent 76% validation accuracy to 60% indicates that the current set of rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data as effectively as before.
- The decrease in accuracy suggests that the model may be **underfitting**, meaning it is not complex enough or lacks sufficient features to capture the relationships between the molecular descriptors and the catalytic performance.

---

**SHAP Value Analysis on the Validation Set:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insight into how each rule (feature) contributes to the model's predictions for each molecule. The analysis of the SHAP values reveals patterns that can help identify which rules may be contributing to incorrect predictions.

**Observations:**

1. **Consistent Positive SHAP Values for Certain Rules:**

   - **Rules Involved:** Rule6, Rule7, Rule9, Rule13.
   - **Molecules with Overestimated Loadings:**
     - Molecules where the predicted loading is **high**, but the experimental value is **low**.
     - For these molecules, the SHAP values for Rule6, Rule7, Rule9, and Rule13 are consistently positive and relatively high.
     - **Examples:**
       - *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
       - *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*
       - *C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F*
       - *COCCOCCOCC(=O)O*
       - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O*

2. **Negative SHAP Values Leading to Underestimated Loadings:**

   - **Rules Involved:** Rule7 and Rule9.
   - **Molecules with Underestimated Loadings:**
     - Molecules where the predicted loading is **low**, but the experimental value is **high**.
     - For these molecules, the SHAP values for Rule7 and Rule9 are negative or less positive, which may contribute to the underestimation.
     - **Example:**
       - *C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN*

3. **Uniform SHAP Values Across Multiple Molecules:**

   - The SHAP values for each rule are identical or very similar across different molecules, suggesting that the rules may not be providing sufficient discriminatory power.

---

**Assessment of Current Rules and Model Performance:**

- **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
  - The current rules seem to be less effective in accurately predicting the catalyst loading.
  - The consistent SHAP values across different molecules, regardless of their experimental outcomes, indicate that the rules may not be capturing the unique features of each molecule.

- **Potential Overfitting/Underfitting:**
  - **Underfitting:**
    - Given the decrease in accuracy and the uniformity in SHAP values, it appears that the model is underfitting.
    - The rules may be too generic or not adequately tailored to capture the complex relationships in the data.
  - **Overfitting (Less Likely in This Case):**
    - Overfitting seems less likely, as the model is not performing well even on the training/validation data.

- **Discrepancies Identified:**
  - **Overestimated Loadings:**
    - Molecules with high predicted loadings but low experimental values point towards issues with rules that are contributing positively to the prediction.
    - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:** Rule6, Rule7, Rule9, Rule13.
  - **Underestimated Loadings:**
    - Molecules with low predicted loadings but high experimental values suggest that certain rules may be suppressing the prediction undesirably.
    - **Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:** Rule7, Rule9.

- **Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics:**
  - The significant drop in accuracy suggests that the probability of improvement with the current rules is low without adjustments.
  - The model may have reached a local minimum, and further iterations without changes may not lead to better performance.

---

**Deriving Insights for Rule Improvement:**

- **Uniform SHAP Values Indicate Limited Rule Impact:**
  - The similarity in SHAP values across different molecules suggests that the rules may not be sensitive enough to the specific features that distinguish molecules with high vs. low experimental loadings.
  
- **Critical Rules for Review:**
  - **Rule6 (Modifiers containing a thiol group on an aromatic ring):**
    - Consistently contributing positively to predictions, even for molecules where this may not be relevant.
  - **Rule7 (Modifiers with an aldehyde group attached to an aromatic ring):**
    - High positive SHAP values in overestimations and negative SHAP values in underestimations.
  - **Rule9 (Modifiers with long aliphatic chains containing amino groups):**
    - Influential in both overestimations and underestimations, suggesting that its current formulation may not be accurate.

- **Opportunity for Refinement:**
  - The SHAP analysis indicates that adjusting the definitions or conditions within these rules may improve the model's ability to differentiate between high and low catalyst loadings.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values in Overestimations:**

   - **Rule6 and Rule7:**
     - **Action:**
       - Re-evaluate the chemical features and underlying properties defined in these rules.
       - Consider adding more specific conditions or exceptions to avoid incorrect positive contributions.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - These rules are contributing to the overestimation of catalyst loading in molecules where the experimental value is low.
       - Adjusting these rules can reduce false positives.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations:**

   - **Rule7 and Rule9:**
     - **Action:**
       - Investigate whether these rules are too broadly defined or if they are penalizing certain molecular features unnecessarily.
       - Modify the rules to ensure they do not unduly suppress predictions for molecules that should have high catalyst loadings.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - Negative SHAP values indicate that these rules are decreasing the predicted loading, leading to underestimations.

3. **Enhance Rule Specificity and Sensitivity:**

   - **Introduce Additional Descriptors:**
     - Incorporate more detailed molecular descriptors that capture subtle differences between molecules.
     - Consider electrostatic, steric, and electronic factors that may influence catalyst interactions.
   - **Example:**
     - For aromatic compounds, differentiate between substituents' positions (ortho, meta, para) and their electron-donating or -withdrawing nature.

4. **Address Underfitting by Expanding Feature Space:**

   - **Add New Rules:**
     - Develop new rules based on observed patterns in misclassified molecules.
     - Consider functional groups or structural motifs not currently covered.
   - **Modify Existing Rules:**
     - Adjust the thresholds or conditions within the rules to make them more inclusive or exclusive as needed.

5. **Validate Rule Changes Iteratively:**

   - **Cross-Validation:**
     - Use k-fold cross-validation to assess the impact of rule changes on model performance.
   - **Monitor SHAP Values:**
     - Continuously observe the SHAP values after each iteration to ensure that adjustments are having the intended effect.

6. **Improve Generalization to Prevent Underfitting:**

   - **Increase Model Complexity:**
     - Consider using more complex models or algorithms that can capture non-linear relationships.
   - **Data Augmentation:**
     - If possible, expand the dataset with more examples to provide the model with a broader basis for learning.

---

**Concluding Remarks:**

The current set of rules appears to be insufficient in capturing the complexities of the modifiers' influence on catalyst loading. The significant drop in accuracy and the patterns observed in the SHAP analysis suggest that specific rules, particularly Rule6, Rule7, and Rule9, are contributing to misclassifications.

By refining these rules, adjusting their conditions, and considering additional molecular features, the model's performance can potentially be improved. It is crucial to iteratively test and validate any changes to ensure that the rules become more predictive and generalizable without introducing overfitting.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Rule Refinement:**
  - Collaborate with domain experts to reassess the chemical rationales behind the problematic rules.
  - Update rules to better reflect the underlying chemistry.

- **Model Retraining:**
  - Incorporate the refined rules into the feature matrix.
  - Retrain the model and evaluate performance metrics.

- **Further Analysis:**
  - Perform additional SHAP analysis after adjustments to confirm improvements.
  - Identify any new patterns of discrepancies for ongoing refinement.

By following these recommendations, we can enhance the predictive power of the model and achieve more accurate and reliable results in the catalytic research program.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

**Summary:**

The current rules designed to predict the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction have shown limitations in their specificity and applicability. The metrics indicate high confidence and lift but very low support, suggesting that while the rules are accurate when they apply, they cover only a small portion of the dataset. Additionally, the overall model accuracy has decreased compared to previous iterations, possibly due to underfitting or overly specific rules.

The SHAP analysis reveals that certain rules (particularly Rule6, Rule7, Rule9, and Rule13) contribute consistently positive SHAP values across molecules, leading to overestimations or underestimations in predictions. This uniformity in SHAP values suggests that the rules may not be effectively capturing the distinct features that influence yield.

**Directions for Optimizing Current Rules:**

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Specificity:**

   - **Improve Rule Definitions:** Review and enhance the SMARTS patterns used in each rule to ensure they accurately capture the intended chemical features. This includes:

     - Adjusting patterns to detect specific functional groups in the correct molecular context.

     - Incorporating connectivity and positional information to distinguish between similar structures.

   - **Examples:**

     - **Rule 1:** Modify the pattern to detect amino acids with side-chain carboxylate groups by specifying an additional carboxylic acid group attached to the side chain.

     - **Rule 2:** Improve the pattern to accurately match heteroaromatic side chains, considering fused ring systems like in tryptophan.

     - **Rule 3:** Ensure that the thiol and carboxylic acid groups are connected via an aliphatic chain by specifying the connectivity in the SMARTS pattern.

     - **Rule 4:** Correct the pattern to match pyridine carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the pyridine ring.

2. **Increase Rule Coverage (Support):**

   - **Generalize Rules Where Appropriate:** Merge similar rules or broaden rule conditions to apply to a larger subset of the dataset without sacrificing accuracy.

   - **Balance Specificity and Generality:** Ensure that rules are neither too narrow (low support) nor too broad (low confidence).

   - **Example:** Combine rules that deal with amino acids having functionalized side chains to increase support while maintaining specificity.

3. **Re-evaluate Rules Contributing to Misclassifications:**

   - **Adjust Rules with High Positive SHAP Values in Overestimations:**

     - **Rule6 and Rule7:** Modify these rules to prevent them from contributing positively to predictions for molecules where the experimental yield is low.

   - **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations:**

     - **Rule9:** Refine the rule to prevent it from suppressing predictions for molecules that should have high yields.

4. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors:**

   - **Capture Subtle Differences:** Introduce new descriptors that account for electronic, steric, and electrostatic factors influencing catalyst interactions.

   - **Consider Functional Group Positions and Interactions:** For aromatic compounds, account for the effects of substituents based on their positions (ortho, meta, para) and electronic properties.

5. **Iterative Testing and Validation:**

   - **Use Cross-Validation Techniques:** Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the refined rules generalize well to unseen data.

   - **Monitor Metrics and SHAP Values:** Continuously evaluate the impact of rule adjustments on model performance, particularly on support, confidence, and lift.

6. **Improve Model Complexity and Avoid Underfitting:**

   - **Enhance Feature Space:** Add new rules or modify existing ones to better capture complex relationships in the data.

   - **Consider More Complex Models:** If necessary, explore more sophisticated modeling techniques to capture non-linear patterns.

7. **Collaborate with Domain Experts:**

   - **Chemical Rationalization:** Work with chemists to validate the chemical relevance of the rules and ensure they align with known principles.

   - **Example:** Reassess the chemical rationale behind rules contributing to misclassifications, such as Rule6, Rule7, and Rule9.

8. **Error Handling and Data Quality:**

   - **Address Parsing Issues:** Implement error handling for molecules that cannot be parsed, and review SMILES notations for accuracy.

   - **Verify Examples:** Test SMARTS patterns against known positive and negative examples to ensure they function as intended.

9. **Improve Documentation:**

   - **Enhance Code Comments:** Provide clear explanations for each SMARTS pattern and its relationship to the chemical features in the rules.

   - **Facilitate Future Modifications:** Good documentation will aid in future troubleshooting and refinement efforts.

10. **Ensure Rules Are Context-Sensitive:**

    - **Use Recursive SMARTS:** Employ recursive SMARTS or atom mapping to ensure that functional groups are in the correct context relative to each other.

    - **Example:** For rules dependent on relative positions (e.g., para substitutions), ensure that the SMARTS patterns reflect this spatial arrangement.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

There is considerable room for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current low support suggests that the rules are too specific and not generalizing well to the dataset. By refining the SMARTS patterns, adjusting rule conditions, and incorporating additional molecular descriptors, it is possible to improve both the applicability and accuracy of the rules.

Additionally, the model appears to be underfitting rather than overfitting, indicating that increasing the complexity and coverage of the rules is unlikely to lead to overfitting at this stage. Careful iterative refinement, combined with cross-validation and monitoring of metrics, will help in optimizing the rules while minimizing the risk of overfitting.

**Please Optimize Rules**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been formulated by analyzing the dataset and identifying patterns between the molecular features of the modifiers and their influence on the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures where possible and considers underlying physical-chemical properties, such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, and coordination abilities with the catalyst.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction based on its structural features.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns for improved specificity and accuracy.**

  - **For Rule 1 (Amino acids with side-chain carboxylate groups)**:

    - **Action**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to detect α-amino acids with an additional carboxylic acid group on the side chain.
    - **Implementation**: Use a SMARTS pattern that captures the amino acid backbone (`[NX3H][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H]`) with a side chain containing a carboxylic acid (`[CX3](=O)[OX1H]`) connected via a carbon chain.
    - **Example SMARTS**: `N[C@@H](C)C(=O)O` with a side-chain carboxylic acid represented as `C[C@@H](N)CC(=O)O`.

- **Advice 2**: **Correct and enhance SMARTS patterns for accurate matching of intended structures.**

  - **For Rule 2 (Amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains)**:

    - **Action**: Update the SMARTS pattern to accurately capture α-amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains like tryptophan.
    - **Implementation**: Include patterns for amino acids with side chains connected to heteroaromatic rings, considering fused systems.
    - **Example SMARTS**: `N[C@@H](C)C(=O)O` with a side chain `[cH]1[cH][nH][cH][cH]1` for indole.

These rules have been carefully formulated by analyzing the dataset and identifying patterns between the molecular features of the modifiers and their influence on the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures where applicable and considers underlying physical-chemical properties such as electronic effects, steric factors, and coordination abilities with the catalyst.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction based on its structural features. This systematic approach aids in selecting appropriate modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Combine Rules with Low Coverage to Improve Robustness**

  - *Action*: Merge rules that have similar structural features but low individual data support to enhance their applicability and reliability.
  - *Example*: Combine **Rule 2** (α-amino acids with aromatic heterocyclic side chains) and **Rule 13** (α-amino acids with non-polar, aromatic side chains) into a single rule covering **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains**.
  - *Benefit*: This increases coverage by including more data points (e.g., tryptophan and phenylalanine), providing a more comprehensive understanding of how aromatic side chains in amino acids affect yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rules with Conflicting Data Points**

  - *Action*: Re-examine rules where exceptions or conflicting examples exist and adjust the criteria to resolve contradictions.
  - *Example*: For **Rule 15** (modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids leading to low yield), consider specifying additional structural contexts or excluding cases where the ketone is part of an aromatic system, as in 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid, which shows a high yield.
  - *Benefit*: This clarification prevents misclassification and ensures the rule accurately predicts the yield based on specific structural features.

- **Advice 3**: **Expand Rules Supported by Single Data Points**

  - *Action*: Incorporate additional examples or broaden the criteria for rules currently supported by only one data point to meet the coverage requirement.
  - *Example*: For **Rule 4** (modifiers containing a thiol group on a short aliphatic chain), search for or include other modifiers with similar structures that result in high yield.
  - *Benefit*: Enhancing coverage strengthens the rule's validity and predictive power.

- **Advice 4**: **Increase Specificity in Rules with Ambiguous Terms**

  - *Action*: Define vague terms such as "short-chain" or "long-chain" by specifying the exact number of carbons or molecular weight.
  - *Example*: In **Rule 6**, specify that "short-chain aliphatic amino acids or amines" refer to those with **up to 5 carbon atoms**.
  - *Benefit*: This reduces ambiguity, making the rules easier to apply consistently and accurately.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Functional Group Interactions in Rules**

  - *Action*: Consider the role of functional groups that can engage in specific interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking) with the catalyst or substrate, and include these effects in the rules.
  - *Example*: Modify **Rule 5** to explicitly state that electron-withdrawing groups capable of hydrogen bonding at the para position enhance yield due to these interactions.
  - *Benefit*: This provides a clearer rationale for the rule and highlights the importance of functional group interactions in influencing yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Reassess Rules with Insufficient Data Support**

  - *Action*: Temporarily remove or mark rules that lack sufficient data support for further investigation.
  - *Example*: Put **Rule 12** (modifiers containing fluorinated aliphatic chains tend to result in low yield) under review until more data points are available.
  - *Benefit*: This prevents potential misguidance due to unreliable rules and focuses efforts on more substantiated trends.

- **Advice 7**: **Develop New Rules for Unexplained High-Yield Modifiers**

  - *Action*: Analyze high-yielding modifiers not currently explained by existing rules to identify common structural features and formulate new rules.
  - *Example*: Investigate modifiers like 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid to understand why they result in high yield despite containing methoxy groups.
  - *Benefit*: This expands the rule set to cover more compounds and improves the overall predictive capability.

- **Advice 8**: **Integrate Steric and Electronic Effects in Rule Formulation**

  - *Action*: Consider both steric hindrance and electronic properties when creating rules, especially for modifiers where these factors are significant.
  - *Example*: Amend **Rule 10** to explain how the increased steric bulk and potential conformational flexibility of long-chain aliphatic modifiers with amino or hydroxyl groups lead to low yield.
  - *Benefit*: A comprehensive approach provides a deeper understanding of how multiple factors influence the reaction outcome.

- **Advice 9**: **Clarify the Role of Electron-Donating Groups**

  - *Action*: Refine rules regarding electron-donating groups to account for exceptions and contextual dependencies.
  - *Example*: Update **Rule 9** to specify that while electron-donating groups like methyl groups at the para position generally lower yield, the presence of additional coordinating groups may modify this effect.
  - *Benefit*: This nuanced understanding prevents overgeneralization and improves prediction accuracy.

- **Advice 10**: **Review and Update Physical-Chemical Property Explanations**

  - *Action*: Ensure that each rule's underlying physical-chemical properties are accurate and reflect current scientific understanding.
  - *Example*: Reevaluate the explanation in **Rule 14** regarding acylated amino groups to confirm that acylation indeed reduces coordination ability in the context of the catalyst system.
  - *Benefit*: Accurate explanations enhance the credibility of the rules and aid in rational modifier design.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**
- **Advice 1**: **Standardize Structural Descriptors**  
  Revise the rules to use standardized and quantifiable structural descriptors that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For example, specify exact chain lengths, ring sizes, or the count of specific functional groups. This makes it easier to generate a numeric feature matrix as each descriptor corresponds to a measurable property.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize SMARTS Patterns for Functional Groups**  
  Define functional groups and substructures using SMARTS patterns compatible with cheminformatics toolkits. This allows for automated detection of these features in SMILES strings, facilitating the conversion of rules into numerical data based on the presence or absence of these patterns.

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify Electronic Effects with Computational Descriptors**  
  Incorporate calculated electronic descriptors such as partial charges, electronegativity, or Hammett sigma constants for substituents on aromatic rings. These numerical values can represent electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects more precisely than qualitative descriptions.

- **Advice 4**: **Include Molecular Descriptors**  
  Expand the rules to consider molecular descriptors like molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), and counts of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. These descriptors are computationally inexpensive to calculate from SMILES and can capture steric and electronic properties numerically.

- **Advice 5**: **Specify Thresholds for Chain Lengths and Steric Bulk**  
  Instead of terms like "short-chain" or "long-chain," set specific carbon atom count thresholds (e.g., chains with ≤5 carbons result in high yield; chains with >6 carbons result in low yield). This removes ambiguity and allows for direct numerical encoding.

- **Advice 6**: **Map Functional Groups to Binary Variables**  
  Create a list of relevant functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amino groups, aldehydes, thiols) and encode their presence as binary variables. This simplifies the feature matrix and aids in statistical analysis or machine learning model training.

- **Advice 7**: **Use Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Parameters**  
  Integrate QSAR parameters that quantify molecular properties affecting reaction outcomes. Parameters like hydrophobicity (LogP), molar refractivity, and electronic parameters can be calculated from SMILES and included in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 8**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**  
  Review the existing rules to identify and merge those with overlapping features. A more concise rule set focusing on key differentiators enhances clarity and reduces complexity in feature extraction.

- **Advice 9**: **Replace Qualitative Terms with Quantitative Metrics**  
  Substitute qualitative descriptors (e.g., "electron-withdrawing groups") with quantifiable metrics like the sum of Hammett sigma constants for substituents. This approach translates chemical intuition into measurable features.

- **Advice 10**: **Implement Molecular Fingerprints**  
  Utilize molecular fingerprints (e.g., ECFP, MACCS keys) to represent molecular structures numerically. Fingerprints convert structural information in SMILES into fixed-length binary vectors, suitable for generating feature matrices and feeding into predictive models.

- **Advice 11**: **Incorporate Coordination Ability Scores**  
  Develop a scoring system for the coordination ability of modifiers based on the number and type of coordinating atoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen lone pairs). Assign numerical values reflecting their potential to interact with the metal catalyst.

- **Advice 12**: **Leverage Machine Learning to Identify Important Features**  
  Use machine learning algorithms to analyze the existing dataset and identify which features most significantly impact yield. This data-driven approach may reveal new patterns not captured by the current rules and guide the refinement of rules based on quantitative importance.

- **Advice 13**: **Annotate SMILES with Enhanced Stereochemistry**  
  Ensure that stereochemical information is included in SMILES where relevant, as stereochemistry can influence reaction outcomes. This allows for numerical encoding of stereocenters and chirality in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 14**: **Consider Solubility and Aggregation Factors**  
  Include descriptors related to solubility and potential for aggregation, such as polar surface area or counts of hydrophilic/hydrophobic moieties. Numerical representation of these properties can help explain steric and solvation effects on yield.

- **Advice 15**: **Create a Hierarchical Feature Extraction Protocol**  
  Establish a systematic protocol for feature extraction that prioritizes features from most to least impactful based on the revised rules. This ensures consistency in how features are derived from SMILES and incorporated into the numeric matrix.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify Rule Features**  
  Refine the existing rules to focus on specific, quantifiable structural features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position tend to result in high yield," specify the exact electron-withdrawing groups and their positions, and assign numerical values or binary indicators to represent their presence.

- **Advice 2**: **Develop a Feature Dictionary of Functional Groups**  
  Create a comprehensive dictionary of functional groups and substructures relevant to the reaction yield. Assign each functional group a unique identifier and define SMARTS patterns for their detection in SMILES strings. This will enable automated parsing and feature extraction from molecular structures.

- **Advice 3**: **Encode Structural Features Numerically**  
  Transform qualitative descriptors into numerical features. For instance, count the number of carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, or nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings. Use binary variables to indicate the presence or absence of specific functional groups, such as thiol groups or aldehyde groups.

- **Advice 4**: **Calculate Physicochemical Properties**  
  Utilize cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit) to calculate physicochemical properties that may correlate with yield, such as molecular weight, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), and pKa values of acidic or basic groups. Include these numerical descriptors in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 5**: **Use Machine-Readable SMARTS Patterns**  
  Convert structural features in the rules into SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns, which can be directly applied to SMILES strings to identify substructures. This allows for automated detection of features like "aromatic carboxylic acids with para electron-withdrawing groups" by specifying the aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, and substituent pattern.

- **Advice 6**: **Implement One-Hot Encoding for Categorical Features**  
  For features with categorical variables (e.g., type of substituent group: nitro, halogen, methyl), use one-hot encoding to represent each category as a binary feature. This facilitates the inclusion of categorical data in numerical models.

- **Advice 7**: **Automate Feature Extraction with Cheminformatics Libraries**  
  Develop scripts using libraries like RDKit or Open Babel to automate the extraction of structural features and descriptors from SMILES strings. This ensures consistency in feature generation and reduces manual errors.

- **Advice 8**: **Prioritize Features Based on Correlation with Yield**  
  Analyze the dataset to identify which features have the strongest correlation with high or low yield. Prioritize these features in the rule set and consider removing features that show little to no correlation to streamline the model.

- **Advice 9**: **Simplify Rules by Merging Similar Patterns**  
  Combine overlapping rules where possible. For example, rules regarding "Modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aromatic rings tend to result in low yield" and "Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups attached directly to the ring tend to result in low yield" can be merged under a rule about reactive groups on aromatic rings leading to low yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Include Steric Hindrance Quantitatively**  
  Quantify steric effects by calculating molecular descriptors such as the molar refractivity or using the Taft steric parameter for substituents. Include these numerical values in the feature matrix to account for steric hindrance factors mentioned in the rules.

- **Advice 11**: **Incorporate Electronic Effects Numerically**  
  Use Hammett sigma constants or other electronic descriptors to numerically represent electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects of substituents. This addresses rules related to electronic properties affecting yield.

- **Advice 12**: **Update Rules Based on Data Analysis**  
  Perform statistical analysis on the dataset to validate existing rules and discover new patterns. Adjust the rules accordingly to better reflect the observed data, ensuring that they are data-driven and not solely theoretical.

- **Advice 13**: **Create a Scalable Feature Matrix**  
  Design the feature matrix to accommodate new modifiers by ensuring that feature extraction methods are generalizable. This involves focusing on fundamental structural elements and properties that can be consistently measured across different molecules.

- **Advice 14**: **Develop Predictive Models Using Machine Learning**  
  Use the numerical feature matrix to train machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) that can predict reaction yield. This approach allows for the identification of complex relationships between features and yield that may not be evident from rules alone.

- **Advice 15**: **Iteratively Refine Rules and Models**  
  Continuously validate and refine both the rules and predictive models using cross-validation and by testing on new data. Incorporate feedback from model performance to further improve feature selection and rule accuracy.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Clarify Rule 4** to eliminate ambiguity. Since 4-aminobenzoic acid is aromatic and included as an example, adjust the rule to encompass both aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids with additional amino or hydroxyl groups on short chains (≤5 carbons). Alternatively, if the focus is solely on aliphatic acids, remove aromatic examples to maintain consistency.

- **Advice 2**: **Enhance the coverage of Rule 5** by incorporating additional data points. Currently, the rule is supported by only one example (octanoic acid). Consider combining this rule with Rule 4 if they share similar underlying principles, or gather more data to substantiate the rule's validity.

- **Advice 3**: **Consolidate rules with limited coverage**. Rules such as 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 are each supported by only one data point. To improve reliability, consider merging rules that have similar structural features or underlying physical-chemical properties. This will increase the number of supporting examples and strengthen the rules' applicability.

- **Advice 4**: **Specify ambiguous terms in Rule 15**. The term "bulky substituents" is vague and can lead to confusion. Provide specific structural criteria or examples of what constitutes a bulky substituent adjacent to coordinating functional groups. This will enhance clarity and help in the accurate identification of low-yield modifiers.

- **Advice 5**: **Ensure consistency between rules and examples** across all rules. Verify that each example clearly fits within the described rule without exceptions. This will prevent confusion and improve the practicality of applying the rules to new modifiers.

- **Advice 6**: **Reassess Rule 5's necessity** given its low coverage and potential overlap with other rules. If no additional supporting data can be found, consider integrating its concept into another relevant rule or removing it to simplify the rule set.

- **Advice 7**: **Strengthen physical-chemical insights** in rules where explanations are brief or generic. Providing deeper insights into how specific structural features impact the reaction mechanism or catalyst interaction will enhance the understanding and predictive power of the rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate additional data points from the dataset** to support and refine the rules. Review the dataset for modifiers that may have been overlooked or can serve as additional examples for existing rules. This will improve coverage and the overall robustness of the rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Evaluate the possibility of new combined rules**. For example, modifiers causing catalyst deactivation due to strong binding (e.g., thiol groups in Rule 13 and aldehyde groups in Rule 7) could be grouped under a common rule about modifiers that can poison or deactivate the catalyst.

- **Advice 10**: **Streamline the rules for practicality**. Aim to reduce redundancy and overlap between rules, focusing on the most impactful structural features. A concise and well-organized set of rules will be more user-friendly and easier to apply in practice.

**End of Advice**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the rules by focusing on quantifiable structural descriptors** that can be easily extracted from SMILES strings. Instead of relying on qualitative descriptions (e.g., "additional carboxylic acid groups"), specify features like the **number of carboxyl groups**, **number of amino groups**, **total heavy atom count**, or **number of heteroatoms** (N, O, S). This makes it easier to generate a numeric feature matrix directly from the molecular structures.

- **Advice 2**: **Rephrase rules to include specific numerical thresholds** for molecular properties. For instance, replace terms like "short chains (≤5 carbons)" with exact ranges such as "alkyl chains with a carbon count between 1 and 5". This precision allows for direct translation into numerical features.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate measurable electronic descriptors** such as **Hammett sigma constants**, **Taft steric parameters**, or **pKa values** into the rules. Quantifying electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects numerically enables a more precise correlation between substituent effects and reaction yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Utilize computationally derived molecular descriptors** (e.g., **log P**, **topological polar surface area (TPSA)**, **molar refractivity**, **electron affinity**) that can be calculated from SMILES strings. Including these descriptors in the rules allows for the creation of a comprehensive numeric feature matrix suitable for modeling.

- **Advice 5**: **Consolidate overlapping rules** to reduce complexity and redundancy. For example, merge rules related to aromatic carboxylic acids by creating a unified rule that considers the type and position of substituents on the aromatic ring, quantified by their electronic and steric parameters.

- **Advice 6**: **Introduce binary and count-based features** in the rules. Assign binary values (1 or 0) to indicate the presence or absence of specific functional groups (e.g., amino group present: 1, absent: 0) and use counts for the number of each functional group. This facilitates direct inclusion in a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 7**: **Implement a hierarchical or decision tree structure** for the rules, where decisions are based on quantifiable molecular features. This approach can be translated into a series of yes/no questions or numerical thresholds that feed into a machine learning model.

- **Advice 8**: **Emphasize steric factors using quantifiable measures** such as **steric bulk parameters** or **van der Waals volumes**. Including these in the rules helps account for steric hindrance effects on catalyst interactions, which can be numerically assessed.

- **Advice 9**: **Consider the overall molecular size and shape descriptors**, like **molecular weight**, **rotatable bond count**, and **aromatic ring count**. Including these factors in the rules can improve the predictive power regarding the modifiers' impact on yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Integrate descriptors related to coordination ability** by quantifying features such as the **number of potential donor atoms** (e.g., N, O, S atoms with lone pairs) and their **geometric arrangement**. This supports a more precise assessment of how well a modifier can coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Property Insight**: Explains that fluorination increases hydrophobicity and can disrupt interactions due to strong electron-withdrawing effects.

  - **Complexity**: Focuses on extensive fluorination as a structural feature.

  - **Coverage**: Supported by 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, which results in low yield. Coverage is limited.

---

- **Comment 13**:

  **Rule 13**:

  - **Clarity**: Indicates that modifiers containing thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings tend to result in low yield.

  - **Property Insight**: Explains that thiol groups may bind too strongly to metal centers, blocking active sites.

  - **Complexity**: Combines the presence of thiol groups with aromatic carboxylic acids.

  - **Coverage**: Supported by 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, resulting in low yield. Only one supporting data point.

---

- **Comment 14**:

  **Rule 14**:

  - **Clarity**: States that dicarboxylic acids with ketone functional groups within the carbon chain result in low yield.

  - **Property Insight**: Explains that ketone groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions.

  - **Complexity**: Considers both the presence of ketone groups and dicarboxylic acid structure.

  - **Coverage**: Supported by 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, showing low yield. Limited coverage.

---

- **Comment 15**:

  **Rule 15**:

  - **Clarity**: Clearly defines that aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents adjacent to coordinating functional groups result in low yield.

  - **Property Insight**: Explains that steric hindrance from bulky groups can prevent effective coordination with the catalyst's active sites.

  - **Complexity**: Involves the combination of bulky substituents and proximity to functional groups.

  - **Coverage**: Supported by 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, leading to low yield. Only one data point supports this rule.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles capable of metal coordination** tend to result in **high yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: α-Amino acids whose side chains include additional carboxylate groups or heterocyclic rings with nitrogen atoms that can coordinate to metal centers.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: The extra carboxylate or nitrogen heterocycle enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity through chelation effects.

  - *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position** tend to result in **high yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic rings bearing a carboxylic acid group and an electron-withdrawing group at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers and stabilize the catalyst through stronger metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring**, especially when the nitrogen is positioned to coordinate with metals, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Heteroaromatic compounds (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) containing nitrogen atoms within the ring and a carboxylic acid substituent.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can act as additional coordination sites, promoting stronger binding with metal centers and enhancing catalytic activity through chelation.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups on short chains (≤5 carbons)** tend to result in **high yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Short-chain aliphatic acids containing amino groups capable of coordinating to metal centers.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: The presence of amino groups enhances interaction with metal centers, while the short chain length minimizes steric hindrance, improving catalyst efficiency.

  - *Examples*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **unsubstituted medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6–8 carbons)** tend to result in **high yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar substituents.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: The hydrophobic chain facilitates interactions with the catalyst's non-polar regions, while the carboxylic acid group provides coordination to the metal center, balancing hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions.

  - *Example*:
    - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) at the para position** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic rings with carboxylic acid groups and electron-donating substituents at the para position.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers and diminishing catalyst effectiveness due to weaker metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) groups attached to the ring** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with aldehyde groups on the ring.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Aldehyde groups are electrophilic and can react with nucleophilic sites on the catalyst or participate in side reactions, deactivating the catalyst or consuming reactive intermediates.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (≥7 carbons) with additional polar functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl)** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Long-chain aliphatic acids bearing polar substituents such as amino or hydroxyl groups.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Increased chain length leads to greater steric hindrance and potential aggregation, while polar groups may interfere with catalyst interactions due to unfavorable solvation effects or competing interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains or ether linkages attached to carboxylic acids** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Carboxylic acids linked to ethylene glycol units [(–OCH₂CH₂–)ₙ], forming PEG chains or containing ether bonds.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: PEG chains and ether linkages increase steric bulk and hydrophilicity, potentially hindering effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's active sites due to steric hindrance and solvation effects.

  - *Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with non-polar aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating functional groups** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: α-Amino acids whose side chains are simple aromatic rings without functional groups capable of metal coordination.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: The absence of functional groups that can coordinate with metal centers reduces interaction with the catalyst, diminishing its effectiveness due to weaker binding.

  - *Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **N-acylated amino groups**, such as **N-acetylated amino acids**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Compounds where the amino group is modified by an acyl group (e.g., acetyl), thus blocking its coordination ability.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Acylation reduces the nucleophilicity and coordination ability of amino groups, limiting their interaction with metal centers in the catalyst and decreasing catalytic activity.

  - *Example*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with extensively fluorinated chains** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aliphatic chains heavily substituted with fluorine atoms.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Fluorination increases hydrophobicity and electron-withdrawing effects, which can disrupt interactions with the catalyst by causing unfavorable conformations or weakening the modifier's affinity for metal centers due to the strong C–F bond's reluctance to participate in coordination.

  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic rings bearing both carboxylic acid and thiol (-SH) groups.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Thiol groups may bind too strongly to metal centers, blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst through irreversible binding or catalyst poisoning.

  - *Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids with ketone functional groups within the carbon chain** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aliphatic dicarboxylic acids containing internal ketone groups within the carbon chain.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: The presence of ketone groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions with the catalyst or reactants, negatively impacting catalyst performance and reaction yield.

  - *Example*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents adjacent to coordinating functional groups** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Compounds with bulky groups near functional sites that would normally coordinate with metal centers, leading to steric hindrance.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Steric hindrance from bulky groups can prevent effective coordination with the catalyst's active sites, reducing catalytic activity due to limited access or unfavorable spatial arrangement.

  - *Example*:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and their influence on the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple substructures (functional groups) where applicable and considers underlying physical-chemical properties such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on its structural features. This systematic approach aids in selecting appropriate modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise SMARTS patterns for Rule 1 to accurately identify α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles.**

  - **Issue**: The current `amino_acid_backbone` pattern `'[NX3;H2][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` may not match all α-amino acids due to overly restrictive hydrogen specifications. Additionally, the `additional_carboxylic_acid` pattern `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` can match the backbone carboxylic acid, leading to false positives.
  
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Update the `amino_acid_backbone` pattern to be less restrictive:
      ```python
      amino_acid_backbone = '[NX3][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'
      ```
      This pattern accounts for possible variations in hydrogenation due to tautomers or zwitterionic forms.
    - Modify the `additional_carboxylic_acid` pattern to exclude the backbone carboxylic acid and ensure it's part of the side chain:
      ```python
      additional_carboxylic_acid_side_chain = '[NX3][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'
      ```
      This pattern looks for an additional carboxylic acid one carbon away from the alpha carbon.
    - Adjust Rule 1 in the code:
      ```python
      patterns['additional_carboxylic_acid_side_chain'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts(additional_carboxylic_acid_side_chain)
      # Update patterns in Rule 1
      'patterns': [
          patterns['amino_acid_backbone'],
          [patterns['additional_carboxylic_acid_side_chain'], patterns['nitrogen_heterocycle']]
      ],
      ```
    - Ensure that the nitrogen heterocycle is part of the side chain attached to the α-carbon. This may require more specific patterns or checking the attachment points.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Adjust SMARTS patterns for Rules 2 and 6 to accurately capture para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing (EWG) or electron-donating groups (EDG).**

  - **Issue**: The current `ewg_para` and `edg_para` patterns may not correctly identify substituents at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.
  
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Create a more precise pattern for para-substituted benzoic acids:
      ```python
      # Electron-withdrawing groups at para position
      ewg_para = '[c:1]1[cH][cH][c:2][cH][cH]1[C](=O)[OH]'
      ewg_group = '[$([NX3+](=O)[O-]),$([F,Cl,Br,I])]'

      # Combine patterns to ensure EWG is at the para position
      ewg_para_pattern = f'{ewg_para.replace("[c:2]", ewg_group)}'

      # Electron-donating groups at para position
      edg_para = '[c:1]1[cH][cH][c:2][cH][cH]1[C](=O)[OH]'
      edg_group = '[$([OX2H]),$([OX2][CH3]),$([CH3])]'

      # Combine patterns to ensure EDG is at the para position
      edg_para_pattern = f'{edg_para.replace("[c:2]", edg_group)}'

      # Compile patterns
      patterns['ewg_para'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts(ewg_para_pattern)
      patterns['edg_para'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts(edg_para_pattern)
      ```
    - Update the code for Rules 2 and 6 to use these new patterns.
    - Ensure that the EWG or EDG is directly attached to the para carbon relative to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine the `nitrogen_heterocycle` pattern for Rule 3 to specifically target heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern `'[c][n]'` may not encompass all nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids, and may generate false positives.
  
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Use a more specific pattern for nitrogen heteroaromatic rings attached to carboxylic acids:
      ```python
      heteroaromatic_nitrogen = '[n][c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1[C](=O)[OH]'
      patterns['heteroaromatic_nitrogen'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts(heteroaromatic_nitrogen)
      ```
    - Update Rule 3 to use this pattern:
      ```python
      'patterns': [
          patterns['heteroaromatic_nitrogen']
      ],
      ```

- **Suggestion 4**: **Improve chain length detection for aliphatic carboxylic acids in Rules 4, 5, and 8.**

  - **Issue**: The current code does not accurately compute chain lengths, leading to incorrect matches for chain length–dependent rules.
  
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Implement a function to calculate the longest carbon chain in the molecule:
      ```python
      from rdkit.Chem import rdmolops

      def get_longest_chain_length(mol):
          chains = []
          for atom in mol.GetAtoms():
              if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6:
                  paths = rdmolops.FindAllPathsOfLengthN(mol, max_path_length=mol.GetNumAtoms(), useBonds=False)
                  for path in paths:
                      chain = [mol.GetAtomWithIdx(idx).GetAtomicNum() for idx in path]
                      if all(num == 6 for num in chain):
                          chains.append(len(chain))
          if chains:
              return max(chains)
          else:
              return 0
      ```
    - Use this function in the rule evaluation to check chain lengths.
    - Modify Rules 4, 5, and 8 to incorporate accurate chain length checks based on the calculated longest chain length.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Enhance the SMARTS pattern for detecting PEG chains and ether linkages in Rule 9.**

  - **Issue**: The current `peg_chain` pattern `'[OX2][CX2][CX2][OX2]'` may miss variations in PEG chain lengths and ether linkages.
  
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Generalize the pattern to detect variable lengths of PEG chains:
      ```python
      peg_chain = '[OX2]([CX2][OX2]){1,}'
      patterns['peg_chain'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts(peg_chain)
      ```
    - This pattern uses a recursive SMARTS to capture one or more repetitions of the -O-C-C- units in PEG chains.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Correct the `n_acylated_amino_group` pattern for Rule 11 to avoid false positives and false negatives.**

  - **Issue**: The pattern `'[NX3][CX3](=O)'` may match any amide linkage, not specifically N-acylated amino groups.
  
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Modify the pattern to ensure that the acylation is on an amino group that would otherwise be primary:
      ```python
      n_acylated_amino_group = '[NX3;H1,C;$([NX3H][CX3](=O)[#6])]'
      patterns['n_acylated_amino_group'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts(n_acylated_amino_group)
      ```
    - This pattern specifically targets primary amino groups that have been acylated.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Update the logic in the code to handle 'and' and 'or' conditions more effectively, especially when combining multiple patterns.**

  - **Issue**: The current code may not correctly apply complex logical conditions specified in the rules, particularly nested 'and'/'or' combinations.
  
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Use a more robust logical expression parser or explicitly define logical operations for patterns:
      ```python
      # Within the rule processing loop
      if 'logic' in rule:
          if rule['logic'] == 'and':
              match = all(
                  any(mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat) for pat in pats) if isinstance(pats, list) else mol.HasSubstructMatch(pats)
                  for pats in rule['patterns']
              )
          elif rule['logic'] == 'or':
              match = any(
                  any(mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat) for pat in pats) if isinstance(pats, list) else mol.HasSubstructMatch(pats)
                  for pats in rule['patterns']
              )
      else:
          # Default logic is 'or' among patterns
          match = any(mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat) for pat in rule['patterns'])
      ```
    - Clearly define the logical relationships in each rule, using nested lists for 'or' conditions and separate entries for 'and' conditions.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Ensure that the SMARTS patterns for functional groups do not inadvertently match unintended parts of the molecule.**

  - **Issue**: Some functional group patterns may be too general and match multiple sites, causing incorrect rule applications.
  
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Add anchors or context to the SMARTS patterns to limit matches to the relevant parts of the molecule.
    - For example, to exclude backbone carboxylic acids when searching for additional carboxylic acids:
      ```python
      additional_carboxylic_acid_side_chain = '[C;!R][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'
      ```
      This pattern excludes carboxylic acids that are part of a ring (common in backbones).

- **Suggestion 9**: **Validate the updated patterns and code with known examples from the rules to ensure correct matching.**

  - **Issue**: Without testing, changes may not lead to the desired improvements.
  
  - **Recommendation**:
    - After implementing the above suggestions, test the code using the example compounds provided in each rule to verify correct matches.
    - For instance, check that aspartic acid and glutamic acid match Rule 1, and that 4-nitrobenzoic acid matches Rule 2.
    - Adjust patterns and logic as necessary based on the test results.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

Upon examining the current rule metrics in comparison to the reference metrics, we can derive insights into the performance of the current set of rules, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**.

1. **Support**:
   - **Reference Metrics**:
     - Train Support: 0.1667 to 0.1845
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - Train Support (Iteration): 0.0248
     - Train Support (Current): 0.0095
   - **Comment**: There is a significant decrease in train support from the reference metrics to the current metrics. This indicates that the current rules apply to a much smaller portion of the training data, suggesting that they are more specific and possibly overfitting.

2. **Confidence**:
   - **Reference Metrics**:
     - Train Confidence: 0.5396 to 0.6352
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - Train Confidence (Iteration): 0.6733
     - Train Confidence (Current): 0.5667
   - **Comment**: The train confidence has increased compared to the lower end of the reference metrics and is within the range of the higher end. This implies that when the rule conditions are met, they are more likely to correctly predict the outcome (high yield or low yield) than in previous iterations.

3. **Lift**:
   - **Reference Metrics**:
     - Train Lift: 1.0559 to 1.2048
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - Train Lift (Iteration): 1.3364
     - Train Lift (Current): 1.1259
   - **Comment**: The lift has improved in the current iteration compared to the reference metrics. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is effective in predicting the outcome better than random chance. The increase suggests that the current rules have a stronger association with the desired outcome.

4. **Leverage**:
   - **Reference Metrics**:
     - Train Leverage: -0.0041 to 0.0289
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - Train Leverage (Iteration): 0.0076
     - Train Leverage (Current): 0.0046
   - **Comment**: The leverage values are positive but lower than the higher end of the reference metrics. This indicates that the rules provide some additional predictive power over chance but may not be as strong as desired.

**Performance Evaluation**

- The **increase in confidence** suggests that the current rules are more accurate when they are applicable. This is a positive development, as higher confidence means that the predictions made when the rule conditions are met are more reliable.
  
- The **improvement in lift** indicates that the rules are more effective at identifying cases with high yield compared to the overall rate in the dataset. This suggests that the rules are capturing meaningful patterns associated with the desired outcome.

- However, the **significant decrease in support** is a concern. Lower support means that the rules apply to fewer instances in the dataset, which could limit their practical usefulness. This may also be a sign of overfitting, where the rules are too specialized to the training data and may not generalize well to new data.

**Assessment of Iterations and Convergence**

- The metrics suggest that **a local minimum may have been reached**. While confidence and lift have improved, the gains are accompanied by a substantial decrease in support. This trade-off indicates that further iterations focusing on increasing confidence and lift might continue to reduce support, leading to overly specific rules.

- The **diminishing returns** in metric improvements suggest that additional iterations using the current approach may not yield significant benefits. It may be an appropriate point to reassess the strategy for rule development.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Balance Specificity and Generality**:
   - *Action*: Re-evaluate the specificity of the rules to find a better balance between precision and coverage.
   - *Rationale*: Highly specific rules may have high confidence and lift but low support. Generalizing some conditions can increase support while maintaining acceptable confidence and lift levels.

2. **Merge Similar Rules**:
   - *Action*: Identify rules with overlapping chemical features or underlying properties and consider merging them.
   - *Rationale*: Combining similar rules can increase support by broadening the applicability of the rules without substantially compromising accuracy.

3. **Expand Rule Conditions**:
   - *Action*: Introduce additional relevant features or relax overly restrictive conditions in the rules.
   - *Rationale*: By capturing a wider range of modifiers that still align with the desired outcome, support can be increased. This may involve including modifiers with similar functional groups or electronic properties.

4. **Review Outlying Rules**:
   - *Action*: Analyze rules contributing minimally to support or having low leverage despite high confidence and lift.
   - *Rationale*: Eliminating or revising such rules can prevent overfitting and improve the overall model by focusing on rules that provide meaningful predictive power.

5. **Incorporate Cross-Validation**:
   - *Action*: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the generalizability of the rules.
   - *Rationale*: Ensuring that the rules perform well on unseen data can prevent overfitting and confirm that the rules are robust.

6. **Leverage Domain Expertise**:
   - *Action*: Consult with chemists to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules and suggest possible adjustments based on chemical knowledge.
   - *Rationale*: Domain experts can provide insights into the chemical relevance of the rules, helping to refine them in a way that balances statistical performance with scientific validity.

7. **Increase Dataset Diversity**:
   - *Action*: If possible, expand the dataset to include more diverse examples of modifiers.
   - *Rationale*: A more comprehensive dataset can help in developing rules that are both accurate and broadly applicable, increasing support while maintaining confidence and lift.

**Conclusion**

The current iteration shows improvements in confidence and lift, indicating that the rules are effective predictors when applicable. However, the substantial reduction in support signals that the rules are becoming too narrow, which may limit their practical utility and generalizability. 

To enhance the performance of the rules:

- Focus on increasing support by generalizing some rule conditions without significantly sacrificing confidence and lift.
- Merge and refine rules to cover a broader range of relevant modifiers.
- Ensure that the rules are validated for both statistical robustness and chemical plausibility.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can become more balanced, providing reliable predictions across a wider portion of the dataset and improving their usefulness in guiding experimental design and optimization in the catalytic research program.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the performance of the current rules has declined compared to previous iterations. Here is a summary of the accuracy metrics:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies**: Consistently around **0.76**
- **Previous Test Accuracies**: **0.75** and **0.625**
- **Current Validation Accuracy**: **0.6**

**Analysis:**

1. **Decrease in Validation Accuracy**: The drop from a validation accuracy of 0.76 to 0.6 indicates that the model's ability to correctly predict the modifier loading has diminished. This is a significant decrease of approximately **16%**, suggesting issues with the current set of rules.

2. **Potential Overfitting/Underfitting**:
   - **Overfitting**: The model might be overfitting to specific patterns within the training data, especially if the rules have become too tailored to the training set and do not generalize well to new data.
   - **Underfitting**: Alternatively, the simplification or modification of rules might have led to underfitting, where the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.

3. **SHAP Analysis Insights**:
   - **Overestimated Loadings**: For molecules where the predicted loading is **high** but the experimental value is **low**, **Rule 11** has a **high positive SHAP value**. This suggests that Rule 11 is contributing significantly to the overestimation.
     - Examples:
       - *Molecule*: `C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`
       - *Predicted vs. Experimental*: High vs. Low
       - *Rule 11 SHAP Value*: `0.0773809523809531`
   - **Underestimated Loadings**: There are also molecules where the predicted loading is **low** while the experimental value is **low**, and **Rule 11** has a **high negative SHAP value**. This indicates that Rule 11 is influencing the prediction in alignment with the experimental data in these cases.
     - Examples:
       - *Molecule*: `C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F`
       - *Predicted vs. Experimental*: Low vs. Low
       - *Rule 11 SHAP Value*: `-0.4642857142857169`

4. **Influence of Rule 11**:
   - Rule 11 is consistently showing high absolute SHAP values (both positive and negative), indicating that it has a strong influence on the model's predictions.
   - The high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings suggest that Rule 11 may be incorrectly assigning high loading predictions to certain molecules.
   - The high negative SHAP values for low predictions align with the experimental values, showing that Rule 11 can contribute positively to accurate predictions but may need refinement to reduce misclassifications.

5. **Comparison with Previous Rules**:
   - In previous iterations, multiple rules contributed to the predictions (e.g., Rules 6, 7, 9, 13).
   - The current model relies heavily on **Rule 11**, potentially reducing the diversity of features that the model considers and leading to decreased performance.

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules, particularly Rule 11, may be overemphasizing certain features, leading to overfitting and a decline in model performance. The decrease in validation accuracy indicates that the model does not generalize well to new data, and the heavy reliance on Rule 11 suggests that the rules may have become too narrow or are incorrectly specified.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the performance of the model, consider the following actions:

1. **Refine Rule 11**:

   - **Observation**: Rule 11 is associated with high positive SHAP values for molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, indicating overestimation.
   - **Action**:
     - Re-express Rule 11 to more precisely define the chemical features it targets.
     - **Clarify Ambiguities**: Ensure that the functional groups and structural motifs described in Rule 11 are not overly broad or inclusive of molecules that should not be classified as low yield.
     - **Adjust Thresholds**: If Rule 11 includes quantitative thresholds (e.g., number of acylated amino groups), adjust these to better discriminate between high and low yield modifiers.
     - **Specificity Enhancement**: Incorporate additional structural criteria to exclude molecules that do not conform strictly to the problematic features.

2. **Reassess Other Influential Rules**:

   - **Observation**: The model's reliance on a single rule (Rule 11) may indicate that other rules are underutilized or ineffective.
   - **Action**:
     - Review Rules with lower SHAP values to determine if they can be improved or if new rules should be introduced.
     - **Balance Rule Contributions**: Aim for a model where multiple rules contribute meaningfully to the predictions, enhancing robustness.
     - **Update or Merge Rules**: Consider combining similar rules or refining existing ones to capture additional relevant chemical features.

3. **Address Overfitting/Underfitting**:

   - **Observation**: The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the model may not be capturing the underlying patterns effectively.
   - **Action**:
     - **Data Augmentation**: If possible, expand the dataset to include more diverse examples, reducing overfitting by providing the model with a broader range of structures.
     - **Simplify the Model**: Reduce complexity by eliminating redundant or less significant rules, preventing the model from fitting noise in the training data.
     - **Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of data.

4. **Incorporate Additional Chemical Features**:

   - **Observation**: Some discrepancies may be due to important chemical features not captured by current rules.
   - **Action**:
     - **Analyze Misclassifications**: For molecules where predictions do not match experimental results, identify common features not addressed by existing rules.
     - **Develop New Rules**: Create new rules that capture these features, such as steric effects, electronic properties, or specific functional group interactions.
     - **Example**:
       - If certain molecules with overestimated loadings contain bulky side chains that hinder catalyst interaction, consider adding a rule to account for steric hindrance.

5. **Leverage SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement**:

   - **Observation**: SHAP values highlight the impact of each rule on individual predictions.
   - **Action**:
     - For each misclassified molecule, examine which rules have the highest SHAP values.
     - **Adjust Problematic Rules**: Modify the rules that contribute most to incorrect predictions.
     - **Iterative Testing**: After adjustments, re-evaluate the model to assess improvements in accuracy.

6. **Improve Generalization**:

   - **Observation**: The model may not be generalizing well to unseen data.
   - **Action**:
     - **Regularization**: Apply techniques to penalize model complexity, promoting simpler, more generalizable rules.
     - **Feature Selection**: Focus on the most predictive features, eliminating those that add noise or are correlated with overfitting.

7. **Ensure Adequate Iterations**:

   - **Observation**: It's essential to determine if sufficient iterations have been conducted to refine the rules effectively.
   - **Action**:
     - **Monitor Convergence**: Track accuracy metrics over multiple iterations to ensure that the model improves or stabilizes.
     - **Set Evaluation Criteria**: Define acceptable thresholds for validation accuracy to decide when the model has reached an optimal state.

---

By implementing these recommendations, the model should achieve better alignment between predicted and experimental modifier loadings, improving overall accuracy. Continuous monitoring of performance metrics and SHAP analyses will guide further refinements, ensuring that the rules evolve to capture the essential chemical features influencing catalyst behavior.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions to Optimize the Current Rules**

Based on the discussions and analyses provided, there are several key observations and recommendations to improve the current set of rules governing the catalytic action of modified catalysts in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Decline in Model Performance:**
   - The validation accuracy has decreased from approximately **0.76** in previous iterations to **0.6** in the current iteration.
   - The model shows signs of **overfitting** or **underfitting**, with a notable overemphasis on **Rule 11**.

2. **Rule 11's Disproportionate Influence:**
   - **SHAP analysis** indicates that **Rule 11** has a high impact on predictions, contributing to both correct and incorrect classifications.
   - Predicted high modifier loadings do not always align with experimental values, particularly in cases where Rule 11 heavily influences the prediction.

3. **Insufficient Rule Support:**
   - The **support** for current rules has significantly decreased, indicating that they apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.
   - This reduction may limit the practical applicability of the rules and suggest over-specialization.

4. **Need for Balanced Rule Contributions:**
   - The model relies heavily on a single rule, reducing the diversity of features considered and potentially impacting generalizability.

**Directions to Optimize the Current Rules:**

To enhance the performance and generalizability of the model, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Refine Rule 11 to Improve Specificity:**
   - **Issue:** Rule 11 appears to be too broad, leading to overestimation of modifier loading in some cases.
   - **Action:**
     - **Re-express Rule 11** with more precise **SMARTS patterns** to accurately identify N-acylated amino groups that negatively impact catalyst performance.
     - **Exclude Compounds** where acylation does not hinder metal coordination or catalyst interaction.
     - **Ensure Specificity** by incorporating additional structural criteria, such as the position of the acyl group and the nature of the side chain.

2. **Revise SMARTS Patterns for Functional Groups:**
   - **Issue:** Existing SMARTS patterns may be either too general or overly restrictive, leading to incorrect matches.
   - **Action:**
     - **Update Patterns** for α-amino acids, electron-withdrawing groups (EWG), electron-donating groups (EDG), nitrogen heterocycles, polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, and N-acylated amino groups.
     - **Example Adjustments:**
       - Modify the **amino acid backbone** pattern to be less restrictive:
         ```python
         amino_acid_backbone = '[NX3][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'
         ```
       - Create accurate patterns for **para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids**:
         ```python
         ewg_para = '[cH]1ccc([C](=O)O)c1[EWG]'
         edg_para = '[cH]1ccc([C](=O)O)c1[EDG]'
         ```
     - **Anchor Functional Groups** to specific positions to avoid unintended matches.

3. **Enhance Chain Length Detection:**
   - **Issue:** Current methods may not accurately determine chain lengths, affecting rules based on chain length.
   - **Action:**
     - Implement a function to **calculate the longest carbon chain** in the molecule, ensuring accurate application of chain length–dependent rules.
     - Utilize RDKit's cheminformatics capabilities to traverse and assess chain lengths.

4. **Improve Logical Conditions and Rule Combinations:**
   - **Issue:** The code may not correctly handle complex logical combinations of patterns.
   - **Action:**
     - Update the code to effectively manage **'and'** and **'or'** conditions when combining multiple SMARTS patterns.
     - Clearly define and implement the logical relationships for each rule to ensure accurate pattern matching.

5. **Balance Rule Specificity and Generality:**
   - **Issue:** Highly specific rules have high confidence but low support.
   - **Action:**
     - **Generalize some rule conditions** to increase support while maintaining acceptable confidence and lift.
     - **Merge similar rules** to broaden applicability without significant loss of specificity.
     - **Example:** Combine rules that target modifiers with similar electronic effects or coordination properties.

6. **Incorporate Missing Chemical Features:**
   - **Issue:** Important features influencing catalyst performance may not be captured by current rules.
   - **Action:**
     - Analyze misclassified molecules to identify common features not addressed.
     - Develop new rules or modify existing ones to include factors such as **steric hindrance**, **specific functional group interactions**, or **solvent effects**.

7. **Validate and Test Updated Rules:**
   - **Issue:** Changes to rules and patterns need verification to ensure desired outcomes.
   - **Action:**
     - Test updated rules using the **example compounds** provided in each rule to verify correct matches.
     - Adjust patterns and logic based on testing results to correct any mismatches.

8. **Monitor Model Performance and Avoid Overfitting:**
   - **Issue:** Overfitting can reduce the model's predictive power on new data.
   - **Action:**
     - Utilize **cross-validation** techniques to assess generalizability.
     - Apply **regularization** methods to penalize overly complex rules.
     - Continuously monitor performance metrics, such as support, confidence, lift, and accuracy.

9. **Leverage Domain Expertise:**
   - **Issue:** Domain knowledge can enhance rule relevance and applicability.
   - **Action:**
     - Collaborate with chemists to validate the chemical plausibility of rules.
     - Incorporate insights from experimental observations to refine rules.

10. **Increase Dataset Diversity:**
    - **Issue:** A limited dataset may constrain the model's learning capacity.
    - **Action:**
      - Expand the dataset to include more diverse examples of molecular modifiers.
      - Ensure that new data covers a broad range of chemical space relevant to the reaction.

**Judgment on Further Optimization Possibility**

There is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the SMARTS patterns, adjusting the specificity of rules, balancing their contributions, and incorporating additional relevant chemical features, the model's performance can be improved. Implementing these suggestions will enhance the model's accuracy and generalizability, leading to more reliable predictions in experimental applications.

    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **N-acylated amino groups**, such as **N-acetylated amino acids**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Compounds where the amino group is modified by an acyl group (e.g., acetyl), thus blocking its coordination ability.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Acylation reduces the nucleophilicity and coordination ability of amino groups, limiting their interaction with metal centers in the catalyst and decreasing catalytic activity.

  - *Example*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with extensively fluorinated chains** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aliphatic chains heavily substituted with fluorine atoms.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Fluorination increases hydrophobicity and electron-withdrawing effects, which can disrupt interactions with the catalyst by causing unfavorable conformations or weakening the modifier's affinity for metal centers due to the strong C–F bond's reluctance to participate in coordination.

  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic rings bearing both carboxylic acid and thiol (-SH) groups.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Thiol groups may bind too strongly to metal centers, blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst through irreversible binding or catalyst poisoning.

  - *Example*:

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids with ketone functional groups within the carbon chain** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aliphatic dicarboxylic acids containing internal ketone groups within the carbon chain.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: The presence of ketone groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions with the catalyst or reactants, negatively impacting catalyst performance and reaction yield.

  - *Example*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents adjacent to coordinating functional groups** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Compounds with bulky groups near functional sites that would normally coordinate with metal centers, leading to steric hindrance.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Steric hindrance from bulky groups can prevent effective coordination with the catalyst's active sites, reducing catalytic activity due to limited access or unfavorable spatial arrangement.

  - *Example*:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and their influence on the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple substructures (functional groups) where applicable and considers underlying physical-chemical properties such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on its structural features. This systematic approach aids in selecting appropriate modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 11 for Specificity**

  - **Action**: Modify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 11 to accurately identify N-acylated amino groups that negatively impact catalyst performance without being overly broad.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Update the SMARTS pattern to specifically target N-acylated α-amino acids where the amino group is acetylated or otherwise acylated, hindering metal coordination.
    - Example SMARTS pattern:
      ```python
      n_acylated_amino_acid = '[NX3](C=O)[CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
      ```
    - Ensure that this pattern does **not** match compounds where the amino group is free or where acylation does not prevent coordination.

- **Advice 2**: **Revise SMARTS Patterns for Functional Groups**

  - **Action**: Update SMARTS patterns for functional groups to improve accuracy and avoid misclassification.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - **α-Amino Acids**:
      - Use a less restrictive pattern for the amino acid backbone:
        ```python
        amino_acid_backbone = '[NX3][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
        ```
    - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWG) at Para Position**:
      - Anchor the EWG to the para position relative to the carboxylic acid:
        ```python
        ewg_para = 'c1ccc([C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])c1[EWG]'
        ```
      - Define `[EWG]` to include nitro, cyano, halogens:
        ```python
        EWG = '[F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-],C#N'
        ```
    - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDG) at Para Position**:
      - Anchor the EDG to the para position relative to the carboxylic acid:
        ```python
        edg_para = 'c1ccc([C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])c1[EDG]'
        ```
      - Define `[EDG]` to include methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl:
        ```python
        EDG = 'O,C'
        ```
    - **Nitrogen Heterocycles with Carboxylic Acid**:
      - Ensure nitrogen is positioned to coordinate with metals:
        ```python
        heteroaromatic_nitrogen = '[n]1ccc(C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])cc1'
        ```
    - **PEG Chains and Ether Linkages**:
      - Identify ether linkages in chains:
        ```python
        peg_chain = '[OX2H0][CX4H2][CX4H2][OX2H0][CX4H2][CX4H2][OX2H0]'
        ```

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance Chain Length Detection**

  - **Action**: Implement precise calculation of carbon chain lengths to accurately apply chain length–dependent rules.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use RDKit to find the longest aliphatic carbon chain in the molecule.
    - Example code snippet:
      ```python
      from rdkit.Chem import rdmolops
      
      def get_longest_chain_length(mol):
          aliphatic_carbons = [atom.GetIdx() for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6 and not atom.IsInRing()]
          paths = rdmolops.GetAllShortestPaths(mol)
          longest = 0
          for path in paths:
              if all(idx in aliphatic_carbons for idx in path):
                  if len(path) > longest:
                      longest = len(path)
          return longest
      ```
    - Apply this function to determine if a molecule fits within the chain length criteria of relevant rules.

- **Advice 4**: **Improve Logical Conditions in Rules**

  - **Action**: Ensure that logical operators ('and', 'or', 'not') are correctly implemented in rule definitions.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Clearly define the logical relationships between SMARTS patterns within each rule.
    - Use parentheses to group conditions and clarify the order of operations.
    - Example:
      ```python
      # Rule combining multiple features
      pattern = '(' + amino_acid_backbone + ' and ' + has_additional_carboxylate + ') or (' + heteroaromatic_nitrogen + ')'
      ```
    - Verify that the code correctly interprets these logical combinations when matching molecules.

- **Advice 5**: **Balance Rule Specificity and Generality**

  - **Action**: Adjust rules to increase their applicability without sacrificing accuracy.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Generalize** overly specific rules to cover more compounds.
    - **Combine** similar rules that target the same underlying chemical features.
    - Example:
      - Merge Rules 1 and 3 to create a broader rule for amino acids and heterocycles with coordinating groups.
      - Modify Rule 5 to include medium-chain aliphatic acids with or without limited polar groups.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Missing Chemical Features**

  - **Action**: Analyze misclassified molecules to identify and include missing features in the rules.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Review molecules that are incorrectly predicted to identify common unaddressed features (e.g., steric bulk, specific side chains).
    - Develop new rules or adjust existing ones to account for these features.
    - Example:
      - Add a rule for modifiers with steric hindrance near coordinating sites leading to low yield.
      - Create patterns for functional groups like tert-butyl groups causing steric effects.

- **Advice 7**: **Validate and Test Updated Rules**

  - **Action**: Test each updated rule against a set of example compounds to ensure correct classification.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use the provided examples for each rule to validate the SMARTS patterns.
    - Confirm that positive examples match the rule and negative examples do not.
    - Adjust patterns if discrepancies are found during testing.

- **Advice 8**: **Monitor Model Performance to Avoid Overfitting**

  - **Action**: Use appropriate techniques to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Apply cross-validation methods to evaluate the model.
    - If necessary, use regularization techniques to prevent over-reliance on any single rule.
    - Continuously monitor performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, support, confidence, and lift.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains or ether linkages attached to carboxylic acids** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Carboxylic acids linked to ethylene glycol units [(–OCH₂CH₂–)ₙ], forming PEG chains or containing ether bonds.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: PEG chains and ether linkages increase steric bulk and hydrophilicity, potentially hindering effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's active sites due to steric hindrance and solvation effects.

  - *Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with extensively fluorinated aliphatic chains** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aliphatic chains heavily substituted with fluorine atoms attached to carboxylic acid groups.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Fluorination increases hydrophobicity and electron-withdrawing effects, which can disrupt interactions with the catalyst by causing unfavorable conformations or weakening the modifier's affinity for metal centers due to the strong C–F bond's reluctance to participate in coordination.

  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic rings bearing both carboxylic acid and thiol (-SH) groups.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Thiol groups may bind too strongly to metal centers, blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst through irreversible binding or catalyst poisoning.

  - *Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **acylated amino groups**, such as **N-acetylated amino acids**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Compounds where the amino group is modified by an acyl group (e.g., acetyl), thus blocking its coordination ability.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Acylation reduces the nucleophilicity and coordination ability of amino groups, limiting their interaction with metal centers in the catalyst and decreasing catalytic activity.

  - *Example*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids with ketone functional groups within the carbon chain** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aliphatic dicarboxylic acids containing internal ketone groups within the carbon chain.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: The presence of ketone groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions with the catalyst or reactants, negatively impacting catalyst performance and reaction yield.

    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (≥7 carbons) and hydroxyl groups positioned away from the carboxyl group** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Long-chain aliphatic acids with hydroxyl groups located distant from the carboxylic acid group.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: The combination of chain length and remote hydroxyl groups can lead to increased steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

  - *Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents adjacent to coordinating functional groups, leading to steric hindrance**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic carboxylic acids with large substituents near functional sites that would normally coordinate with metal centers.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Bulky groups can prevent effective coordination with the catalyst's active sites due to steric hindrance, reducing catalytic activity by limiting access or causing unfavorable spatial arrangements.

  - *Example*:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and their influence on the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple substructures (functional groups) and considers underlying physical-chemical properties such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on its structural features. This systematic approach aids in selecting appropriate modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the reaction.

**End of Comments**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Revise Rule 3 to include thiol groups or create a new rule for thiol-containing short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids.**

  - *Action*: Modify Rule 3 to state that short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (≤6 carbons) with amino **or thiol** groups tend to result in high yield. Alternatively, establish a separate rule specifically for thiol-containing compounds like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

  - *Justification*: This addresses the confusion caused by including a thiol-containing compound as an example in Rule 3, which originally focused on amino groups. Recognizing that thiol groups can also enhance metal coordination and improve catalyst efficiency will improve the rule's clarity and consistency.

- **Advice 2**: **Combine or expand rules with limited data points to enhance robustness.**

  - *Action*: For rules supported by only one data point (e.g., Rules 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15), consider combining them based on shared chemical features or underlying properties. For example, merge Rules 10 and 12 that both involve modifications reducing coordination ability due to electron-withdrawing effects or steric hindrance.

  - *Justification*: Merging similar rules will strengthen coverage and provide a more robust framework, reducing the likelihood of overfitting to individual data points.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rule 5 to account for exceptions and improve accuracy.**

  - *Action*: Adjust Rule 5 to include additional criteria that explain exceptions like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, which results in high yield despite having an electron-donating group. Consider specifying the influence of chain length or the position of substituents relative to the carboxylic acid group.

  - *Justification*: Refining the rule will account for compounds where the electron-donating effect is offset by other factors, such as increased distance from the aromatic ring or additional functional groups enhancing coordination.

- **Advice 4**: **Develop a new rule for medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional substituents.**

  - *Action*: Create a rule stating that **medium-chain (6–8 carbons) aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar substituents tend to result in high yield**.

  - *Justification*: Octanoic acid (an 8-carbon aliphatic carboxylic acid) results in high yield and is not adequately covered by existing rules. Including this rule will improve coverage and provide guidance on modifiers that facilitate catalyst interactions through hydrophobic effects without steric hindrance from polar groups.

- **Advice 5**: **Evaluate and adjust rules where conflicting data exists, such as thiol-containing compounds.**

  - *Action*: Reassess Rule 11 concerning thiol groups attached to aromatic rings. Since 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (with a thiol group) results in high yield, clarify whether the negative effect is specific to the aromatic context or due to other factors.

  - *Justification*: This will resolve inconsistencies and ensure that rules accurately reflect the influence of thiol groups in different chemical environments.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate quantitative parameters to address steric effects and electronic properties.**

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Define Explicit Molecular Descriptors**  
  Refine the current rules to include specific molecular descriptors that can be calculated numerically from the SMILES strings. For example, instead of qualitative terms like "short-chain" or "long-chain" aliphatic acids, specify the exact carbon chain length as a numerical feature (e.g., `ChainLength = number of carbons in the longest carbon chain`).

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize SMARTS Patterns for Functional Groups**  
  Translate the chemical features in the rules into SMARTS patterns that can be algorithmically detected within the SMILES representations. This makes it easier to automate the identification of functional groups and structural motifs relevant to the reaction yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify Electronic Effects Numerically**  
  Replace qualitative descriptors of electronic effects (e.g., "electron-withdrawing substituents") with quantitative parameters such as Hammett sigma constants (`σ` values) or calculate the sum of sigma constants for substituents on the aromatic ring. This allows for numerical representation of electronic influences on coordination ability.

- **Advice 4**: **Include Calculable Molecular Properties**  
  Incorporate molecular properties that can be directly computed from the SMILES strings, such as:
  - **Molecular Weight**
  - **LogP (Partition Coefficient)**
  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**
  - **Number of Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**
  - **pKa Values (for acids and bases)**
  These properties can serve as continuous numerical features in the dataset.

- **Advice 5**: **Count Coordination Sites Numerically**  
  For metal coordination abilities, numerically count the number of potential donor atoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) present in the modifier molecule (`DonorAtomCount`). This provides a direct measure of the ligand's ability to coordinate with metal centers.

- **Advice 6**: **Automate Descriptor Calculation with Cheminformatics Tools**  
  Use cheminformatics libraries (e.g., RDKit) to automate the calculation of the defined molecular descriptors and ensure compatibility with computational analysis pipelines. This standardizes descriptor generation and reduces manual errors.

- **Advice 7**: **Standardize and Simplify Rules with Clear Thresholds**  
  Modify the rules to have clear numerical thresholds or criteria. For example:
  - **High Yield**: Modifiers with `DonorAtomCount ≥ 2` and `ChainLength ≤ 6`.
  - **Low Yield**: Modifiers with `ChainLength ≥ 7` or `StericHindranceIndex ≥ threshold`.
  This removes ambiguity and makes the rules more consistent for computational applications.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Steric Parameters Quantitatively**  
  Quantify steric hindrance using parameters like Taft steric constants or calculate the van der Waals volume (`Vw`) of substituents near the coordination sites. Include these values as numerical features (`StericHindranceIndex`).

- **Advice 9**: **Statistically Validate and Update Rules**  
  Use statistical methods (e.g., regression analysis, decision trees) to identify which molecular descriptors significantly correlate with the reaction yield. Update the rules to focus on these key descriptors, improving their predictive power.

- **Advice 10**: **Provide Feature Vector Examples for Modifiers**  
  Demonstrate how each modifier can be converted into a feature vector based on the new numerical descriptors. For instance:
  - Modifier: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - `DonorAtomCount = 3` (2 oxygens in carboxyl group + 1 nitrogen in nitro group)
    - `SigmaTotal = σ_para-nitrobenzene`
    - `ChainLength = 7` (benzene ring counted as 6 carbons + 1 carbon in carboxyl group)
    - `Yield = High`
  This helps in aligning the dataset with the new rules and facilitates machine learning applications.

It is supported by data points showing both high and low yields (e.g., high yield: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid; low yield: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), providing acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear in stating that modifiers with polyether chains or multiple ether linkages tend to result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight regarding increased molecular flexibility hindering coordination is reasonable. The rule focuses on specific substructures, adding complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), ensuring acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 specifies that heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in low yield due to increased hydrophobicity and reduced coordination. While the physical-chemical insight is plausible, the rule is supported by only one data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), limiting its coverage and robustness. Additional examples are needed to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 indicates that amino acids with acylated amino groups tend to result in low yield due to diminished coordination ability. The physical-chemical reasoning is sound. However, the rule is based on a single data point ((2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), limiting coverage. More supporting data are necessary to validate the rule.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 suggests that modifiers with keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids result in low yield due to possible side reactions. While the physical-chemical insight is acceptable, the rule is supported by only one data point (4-oxoheptanedioic acid), limiting its coverage. Additional data points would enhance the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 states that steric hindrance from bulky substituents near coordination sites leads to low yield. The physical-chemical reasoning is appropriate. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), and there is a potential conflict with 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (which results in high yield), suggesting the rule may not universally apply. Coverage is limited, and further data are needed for validation.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 highlights that modifiers with functional groups causing strong, irreversible binding to metal centers may result in low yield due to catalyst poisoning. The physical-chemical insight is valid. However, the rule relies on a single data point (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), limiting coverage and requiring additional examples for confirmation.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 indicates that modifiers with functional groups susceptible to side reactions tend to result in low yield. This overlaps with Rule 6, which also addresses aldehyde-containing modifiers leading to low yield. The redundancy suggests these rules could be consolidated for clarity. The physical-chemical insight is sound, and coverage is acceptable but may not necessitate separate rules.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 suggests that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups may result in moderate to high yield, depending on chain length and substituents. While the physical-chemical rationale is reasonable, the rule is supported by only one data point (octanoic acid), limiting coverage. Additional examples are needed to substantiate the rule.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules to Enhance Clarity**

  - **Action**: Merge **Rule 6** and **Rule 14** since both address modifiers containing **aldehyde groups** that lead to **low yield** due to potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation.
  - **Rationale**: Combining these rules reduces redundancy and simplifies the rule set, making it clearer that aldehyde-containing modifiers generally result in low yield regardless of structural variations.
  - **Implementation**: Create a single, more comprehensive rule that encompasses all modifiers with functional groups susceptible to side reactions, specifically aldehydes.

- **Advice 2**: **Reevaluate Rules with Limited Data Support**

  - **Action**: Reconsider the inclusion of **Rules 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15**, which are each supported by only a single data point.
  - **Rationale**: Rules based on limited data may not be robust or generalizable. Rewriting these as observations or suggestions rather than definitive rules would more accurately reflect the data.
  - **Implementation**: Amend these rules to indicate that they are preliminary findings, or consider removing them until more supporting data is available.

- **Advice 3**: **Investigate Conflicting Data to Refine Rules**

  - **Action**: Examine the discrepancy in **Rule 12** regarding steric hindrance, where **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** shows low yield but **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** results in high yield.
  - **Rationale**: Understanding the reasons behind conflicting outcomes will help refine the rule to account for nuances such as linker length or flexibility.
  - **Implementation**: Adjust the rule to specify conditions under which steric hindrance affects yield, possibly incorporating factors like chain length or substituent positioning.

- **Advice 4**: **Specify Conditions in Rules with Variable Outcomes**

  - **Action**: For rules like **Rule 7** that note variable yield with electron-donating substituents, clearly define the conditions that lead to high or low yield.
  - **Rationale**: Detailed conditions improve the predictive power of the rules and assist in the selection of effective modifiers.
  - **Implementation**: Modify the rule to include the impact of substituent position and ability to participate in metal coordination.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance Physical-Chemical Explanations for Greater Insight**

  - **Action**: Provide more detailed physical-chemical insights, particularly for rules with limited data support or complex interactions.
  - **Rationale**: Deeper explanations strengthen the understanding of how structural features influence yield and justify the rules’ inclusion.
  - **Implementation**: Expand on how specific functional groups interact with the catalyst, including electronic and steric effects, and reference relevant chemical principles.

- **Advice 6**: **Prioritize and Emphasize Well-Supported Rules**

  - **Action**: Focus on refining and highlighting **Rules 1 to 5**, which have strong data support and coverage.
  - **Rationale**: Prioritizing robust rules ensures the rule set is both reliable and practical for predicting yield outcomes.
  - **Implementation**: Ensure these rules are prominently featured and clearly articulated, possibly expanding with additional examples if available.

- **Advice 7**: **Gather Additional Data for Underrepresented Cases**

  - **Action**: Conduct further experiments or data collection to support or refute rules with limited coverage, such as **Rules 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15**.
  - **Rationale**: Additional data will validate these rules or reveal new patterns, enhancing the overall robustness of the rule set.
  - **Implementation**: Plan targeted experimental studies focusing on modifiers that fall under these rules to collect more comprehensive data.

- **Advice 8**: **Address Exceptions by Creating Sub-Rules or New Rules**

  - **Action**: For modifiers that do not conform to existing rules, such as **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**, consider developing new rules or sub-rules.
  - **Rationale**: Accounting for exceptions improves the rule set's accuracy and applicability to a wider range of modifiers.
  - **Implementation**: Analyze these exceptions to identify unique features and incorporate them into the rule set appropriately.

- **Advice 9**: **Simplify Rules by Generalizing Where Appropriate**

  - **Action**: Generalize overly specific rules to cover broader categories without sacrificing accuracy.
  - **Rationale**: Simplified rules are easier to apply and remember, making them more useful in practical applications.
  - **Implementation**: Combine similar rules or rephrase them to capture the essential features that determine yield outcomes.

- **Advice 10**: **Ensure Consistency and Uniformity in Rule Presentation**

  - **Action**: Standardize the terminology, format, and structure across all rules.
  - **Rationale**: Consistency improves readability and understanding, facilitating better application of the rules.
  - **Implementation**: Review all rules for uniform language, ensure consistent use of chemical terms, and align the layout of each rule's components.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that contain **functional groups capable of chelating to metal centers**, such as **amino groups**, **pyridine nitrogen atoms**, or **thiol (-SH) groups**, **along with a carboxylic acid group**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Presence of donor atoms (N, S) capable of forming chelate complexes with metal ions, combined with carboxylate groups.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Chelation enhances the stability and reactivity of metal-ligand complexes, promoting effective catalysis by strengthening metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** (e.g., **pyridine**, **pyrazole**, **pyridone rings**) tend to result in **high yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metal centers, along with carboxylic acid groups.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Nitrogen atoms in aromatic systems act as additional coordination sites, enhancing binding with metal centers and improving catalytic activity through effective chelation.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents** (e.g., **nitro**, **halomethyl**, **carbonyl groups**) tend to result in **high yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic rings bearing carboxylic acid groups and electron-withdrawing substituents that increase acidity and coordination ability.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid, strengthening metal-ligand interactions and improving catalyst performance.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **short to medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (3–6 carbons) with additional coordinating groups** (e.g., **amino**, **thiol** groups) tend to result in **high yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aliphatic carboxylic acids containing functional groups capable of metal coordination, within a short to medium carbon chain length.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Short chains reduce steric hindrance, and coordinating groups provide additional binding sites to the metal catalyst, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

  - *Examples*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (7 or more carbons) with polar substituents at terminal positions** (e.g., **amino**, **hydroxyl groups**) tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Long aliphatic chains with polar functional groups distant from the carboxyl group.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Increased chain length introduces steric hindrance and flexibility, reducing effective coordination with metal centers due to spatial separation of coordinating groups.

  - *Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that contain **aldehyde (-CHO) groups in conjunction with carboxylic acid groups** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Carboxylic acids substituted with aldehyde functional groups.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or bind irreversibly to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst or interfering with the reaction pathway.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents**, such as **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **methoxy (-OCH₃)** groups, display **variable yield** depending on the position and impact of the substituents.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic rings with carboxylic acid groups and electron-donating substituents.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, potentially weakening metal-ligand interactions. However, if these groups can participate in coordination or are positioned favorably, they may enhance yield.

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that contain **polyether chains** or **multiple ether linkages** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Carboxylic acids with ether bonds or polyether segments (e.g., ethylene glycol units).

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and solvation, which may hinder effective coordination with metal centers and reduce catalyst efficiency.

  - *Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aliphatic chains with multiple fluorine substitutions.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Extensive fluorination increases hydrophobicity and the electron-withdrawing effect, which can reduce interaction with metal centers and hinder effective coordination.

  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with acylated amino groups** (e.g., **N-acetylated amino acids**) tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Amino acids where amino groups are blocked by acylation.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Acylation diminishes the amino group's ability to coordinate with metal centers, reducing potential chelation and catalytic enhancement.

  - *Example*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acid functionality** (e.g., **β-keto acids**) tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Carboxylic acids with ketone groups near the carboxyl group.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Keto groups can interact with metal centers or participate in enolization, potentially disrupting catalyst activity or engaging in side reactions.

  - *Example*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents causing significant steric hindrance near coordination sites** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Bulky groups adjacent to functional groups involved in metal coordination (e.g., large alkyl or aromatic substituents).

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Steric hindrance can obstruct the approach of modifiers to the metal center, preventing effective coordination and reducing catalytic activity.

  - *Example*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **multiple functional groups capable of strong, irreversible binding to metal centers** (e.g., **thiol groups on aromatic rings**) may result in **low yield** due to catalyst deactivation.

  - *Chemical Features*: Functional groups that form strong bonds with metal centers, potentially blocking active sites.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Overly strong binding can lead to catalyst poisoning, where the metal center becomes inactive for further catalytic cycles.

  - *Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that contain **functional groups susceptible to side reactions** (e.g., **aldehydes**, **reactive ketones**) tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Reactive functional groups that may engage in undesired reactions under catalytic conditions.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Side reactions can consume the catalyst or intermediates, diverting the reaction pathway and decreasing overall yield.

  - *Examples*:
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** may result in **moderate to high yield**, depending on chain length and absence of interfering substituents.

  - *Chemical Features*: Straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with minimal functionalization.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Lack of interfering groups allows for straightforward coordination through the carboxylate, but absence of additional coordinating functionality may limit effectiveness compared to chelating modifiers.

  - *Example*:
    - **Octanoic acid** (High yield)

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by thoroughly analyzing the provided dataset and correlating the structural features of the molecular modifiers with the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines specific substructures (functional groups) and considers underlying physical-chemical properties such as coordination abilities, electronic and steric effects, potential side reactions, and catalyst interactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This systematic approach aids in selecting appropriate modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the reaction, balancing the need for effective coordination with the catalyst and minimizing unfavorable interactions.

The generated rules prioritize coverage of the dataset, balancing simplicity and complexity to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different molecular features influence the reaction outcome. This allows for informed decisions when designing or selecting modifiers for similar catalytic systems.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: In **Rule 2**, the SMARTS patterns used in the code only match specific positions of nitrogen within pyridine rings (e.g., '[n][c][c][c][c][c]'). This approach is too restrictive and may miss other heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms like pyrazole or pyridone. To accurately represent the rule, the code should use more general SMARTS patterns that match any heteroaromatic ring containing nitrogen atoms with a carboxylic acid group. For example, use '[c,n]1[c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n]1' to match six-membered heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen, or include patterns for five-membered rings like pyrazole ('[nH]1ncccc1'). Additionally, ensure the carboxylic acid is directly attached to the ring.

- **Suggestion 2**: In **Rule 3**, the code references 'Halogen' in the pattern '[c][CH2][Halogen]', but 'Halogen' is not defined in the code. This leads to an error or the pattern not matching any structures. To fix this, define 'Halogen' as '[F,Cl,Br,I]' in the code or directly include it in the pattern like '[c][CH2][F,Cl,Br,I]'. This ensures that halomethyl groups on aromatic rings are correctly identified.

- **Suggestion 3**: The patterns in **Rule 3** for electron-withdrawing groups need correction. The nitro group is improperly represented as '[c][NX3](=O)=O', which may not match nitro groups correctly. Instead, use '[c][N+](=O)[O-]' to accurately match aromatic nitro groups. Similarly, for carbonyl groups on aromatic rings, ensure the pattern correctly identifies substituents like aldehydes or ketones attached to the ring, such as '[c][CX3](=O)[#6]'.

- **Suggestion 4**: In **Rule 4**, the pattern for short to medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids is too specific ('[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'). This only matches a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid at the end. To generalize for chains of 3–6 carbons, the code should use '[CH2]{2,5}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'. Additionally, the presence of coordinating groups (e.g., amino '[NX3;H2,H1][#6]' or thiol '[SX2H]') should be detected anywhere along the chain, not just at specific positions.

- **Suggestion 5**: For **Rule 5**, the pattern for long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids ('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2]{5,}') may not ensure that polar substituents are at terminal positions. The code should include patterns that check for polar groups like amino or hydroxyl ('[NX3;H2,H1][#6]', '[OX2H]') at the opposite end of the chain from the carboxylic acid. For example, use '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2]{5,}[NX3;H2,H1]' to match a long chain with an amino group at the terminus.

- **Suggestion 6**: In **Rule 7**, the code assigns a prediction of '0' for variable yield but does not distinguish between high and low yields based on substituent positions. The rule mentions that the yield depends on the position and impact of electron-donating substituents. The code should be modified to check for specific positions (ortho, meta, para) of substituents like hydroxyl or methoxy groups on the aromatic ring relative to the carboxylic acid, and assign predictions accordingly.

- **Suggestion 7**: In **Rule 15**, the 'exclude_patterns' include '[a]', which matches any aromatic atom, potentially excluding all aromatic carboxylic acids regardless of other features. This contradicts the rule referring to simple aliphatic carboxylic acids. To correct this, remove '[a]' from the exclude patterns, and instead focus on excluding molecules with coordinating groups or interfering substituents. This ensures that aromatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups are not incorrectly excluded.

- **Suggestion 8**: Throughout the code, ensure that all SMARTS patterns are properly defined and valid. Undefined variables like 'Halogen' or patterns that do not conform to SMARTS syntax can lead to incorrect matching. It's important to validate each SMARTS pattern individually, perhaps using a cheminformatics toolkit like RDKit, to ensure they match the intended functional groups.

- **Suggestion 9**: Incorporate error handling and logging into the code to catch and report molecules that fail to parse or patterns that fail to match. This will help identify issues with specific SMILES strings or SMARTS patterns during execution, allowing for timely corrections.

- **Suggestion 10**: To improve the accuracy of the feature matrix, consider using substructure searches that account for resonance structures, tautomers, and protonation states where relevant. This can be achieved by using more sophisticated matching options or by normalizing molecules before pattern matching.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

**Introduction**

In evaluating the performance of the current set of rules for predicting catalytic yields, we focus on two key metrics: **confidence** and **lift**. Confidence measures the proportion of times the rules are correct when the conditions are met, while lift indicates how much better the rules are at predicting the outcome compared to random chance.

**Previous Metrics for Reference**

To assess improvement, we compare the current metrics to the previous baseline metrics.

- **Previous Train Support**: 0.1667 and 0.1845
- **Previous Train Confidence**: 0.6352 and 0.5396
- **Previous Train Lift**: 1.2048 and 1.0559
- **Previous Train Leverage**: 0.0289 and -0.0041

**Current Metrics**

The metrics from the current iteration are as follows:

1. **Iteration 1 Metrics**:

   - **Train Support**: 0.0248
   - **Train Confidence**: 0.6733
   - **Train Lift**: 1.3364
   - **Train Leverage**: 0.0076

2. **Iteration 2 Metrics**:

   - **Train Support**: 0.0095
   - **Train Confidence**: 0.5667
   - **Train Lift**: 1.1259
   - **Train Leverage**: 0.0046

3. **Current Overall Metrics**:

   - **Train Support**: 0.0533
   - **Train Confidence**: 0.6819
   - **Train Lift**: 1.3488
   - **Train Leverage**: 0.0126

**Performance Comparison**

***Confidence***

- **Improvement Over Previous Metrics**: The current train confidence is **0.6819**, which is higher than both previous train confidence values (**0.6352** and **0.5396**). This indicates that, when the rule conditions are met, there is a higher probability of correctly predicting a high yield.
- **Iteration Analysis**:
  - From Iteration 1 to the current metrics, confidence increased from **0.6733** to **0.6819**.
  - Despite a slight decrease in Iteration 2 (**0.5667**), the overall trend shows improvement.

***Lift***

- **Improvement Over Previous Metrics**: The current train lift is **1.3488**, surpassing the previous lifts (**1.2048** and **1.0559**). A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is effective in identifying high-yield cases better than random chance.
- **Iteration Analysis**:
  - Lift increased from **1.3364** in Iteration 1 to **1.3488** in the current metrics.
  - The dip in Iteration 2 to **1.1259** suggests variability, but the overall lift has improved.

**Determination of Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency**

A local minimum in this context refers to a point where further iterations do not significantly enhance the performance metrics. To determine if we've reached a local minimum, we observe the change in metrics across iterations.

- **Incremental Improvements**:
  - The increase in confidence from **0.6733** to **0.6819** and in lift from **1.3364** to **1.3488** indicates ongoing improvement.
  - The gains, however, are becoming marginal, suggesting that the rules are approaching an optimal state.
- **Variability**:
  - The decrease in metrics during Iteration 2 highlights potential overfitting or sensitivity to certain data subsets.
- **Conclusion**:
  - While improvements are still occurring, they are diminishing. This suggests that we may be nearing a local minimum.

**Comments on Current Rules**

The current rules have led to better performance metrics compared to the previous baseline. Specifically:

- **Higher Confidence**: Indicates that the rules are more reliable in predicting high yields when the conditions are met.
- **Higher Lift**: Confirms that the rules are more effective than random chance, and the modifiers identified are significantly associated with high yields.

This improvement suggests that the rules are capturing important chemical features that influence catalytic activity.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

To further enhance the rules and potentially move beyond the local minimum, consider the following strategies:

1. **Expand Data Coverage**

   - **Increase Support**: The current train support is relatively low (**0.0533**), meaning the rules apply to a small portion of the dataset.
   - **Action**: Develop additional rules that cover more data points without sacrificing confidence and lift. This can involve identifying new patterns or subclasses within the data.

2. **Address Low Yield Modifiers**

   - **Balance the Dataset**: Evaluate modifiers that consistently result in low yields and investigate if additional rules can capture their features.
   - **Action**: Create rules that specifically address the characteristics leading to low yields, improving the model's ability to distinguish between high and low yield cases.

3. **Refine Existing Rules**

   - **Rule Specificity**: Analyze if any rules are too broad or too narrow.
   - **Action**: Adjust rules to optimize specificity and generality. For example, merging similar rules or splitting overly broad rules into more precise sub-rules.

4. **Incorporate Additional Chemical Features**

   - **Functional Groups and Properties**: Consider other influential factors such as pKa values, hydrophobicity (logP), or steric parameters.
   - **Action**: Integrate these properties into the rule conditions to capture subtle effects on yield.

5. **Cross-Validation**

   - **Prevent Overfitting**: Ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data.
   - **Action**: Utilize cross-validation techniques to test the rules on different subsets of data and verify consistent performance.

6. **Evaluate Rule Interactions**

   - **Synergistic Effects**: Investigate if combinations of modifiers influence the outcome.
   - **Action**: Develop composite rules that account for interactions between different chemical features.

7. **Consult Domain Expertise**

   - **Chemical Intuition**: Collaborate with chemists to gain insights that may not be immediately apparent from data analysis alone.
   - **Action**: Use expert knowledge to validate rules and suggest new directions for rule development.

8. **Monitor Leverage Values**

   - **Assess Statistical Significance**: Although leverage is not the primary focus, significant positive leverage indicates a meaningful association.
   - **Action**: Ensure that high confidence and lift are accompanied by positive leverage to confirm the strength of the rules.

**Conclusion**

The current rules demonstrate improved performance in predicting high catalytic yields, with increased confidence and lift over the previous baseline. However, the relatively low support suggests that the rules cover a limited portion of the dataset. By expanding the rule set to include more data points and refining existing rules, we can aim to enhance the model's overall performance.

Considering the marginal gains and the possibility of nearing a local minimum, it may be appropriate to continue iterating but with a focus on substantial changes rather than fine-tuning. Exploring new chemical features, addressing data imbalances, and leveraging domain expertise are recommended to drive further improvements.

**Next Steps**

- **Implement Suggested Improvements**: Begin incorporating the above strategies into the rule development process.
- **Set Evaluation Thresholds**: Define criteria for acceptable improvements to determine when sufficient performance has been achieved.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly assess metrics after each iteration to identify trends and make informed decisions about future iterations.

**Final Remarks**

The progress made thus far is encouraging, indicating that the rules are effectively capturing key factors influencing catalytic yields. With targeted enhancements and thorough analysis, it is feasible to further optimize the rule set and achieve robust predictive performance.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the performance of the current set of rules has declined compared to previous iterations. The validation accuracy obtained using the classification model is **0.6571**, which is lower than the previous validation accuracies that were consistently around **0.76**. The test accuracies in prior iterations ranged from **0.75** to **0.625**, indicating that the model previously had better generalization to unseen data.

**Comparison with Previous Metrics:**

- **Previous Validation Accuracies:** Approximately **0.76** across multiple folds.
- **Previous Test Accuracies:** **0.75** and **0.625**.
- **Current Validation Accuracy:** **0.6571**.

This decline in validation accuracy suggests that the current rules are less effective in capturing the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions. The decrease indicates potential issues with the current rule set, such as overfitting to specific features or underfitting due to oversimplification.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

- **Underfitting:** The overall lower accuracy points towards underfitting. The model may not be capturing essential relationships within the data, possibly due to overly generalized rules that fail to account for specific variations.
- **Overfitting Not Evident:** There is no significant indication of overfitting, as the validation accuracy is consistently lower, and there's no substantial disparity between training and validation performances.

**Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values:**

To identify problematic rules, we examine molecules where the predicted loading does not match the experimental value and analyze the SHAP values associated with each rule.

1. **Underestimated Loading (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - **Molecule:** `C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O`
     - **Predicted Loading:** Low
     - **Experimental Loading:** High
     - **Notable Negative SHAP Values:**
       - **Rule 12:** **-0.1881**
       - **Rule 2:** **-0.0773**
     - **Interpretation:** Rule 12 and Rule 2 contribute significantly to underestimating the loading. These rules may be overly penalizing certain features present in the molecule, leading to incorrect predictions.

   - **Molecule:** `C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O`
     - **Predicted Loading:** Low
     - **Experimental Loading:** High
     - **Notable Negative SHAP Values:**
       - **Rule 2:** **-0.3532**
       - **Rule 12:** **-0.2248**
     - **Interpretation:** The substantial negative SHAP value for Rule 2 indicates it heavily influences the underestimation. Rule 12 also contributes negatively.

   - **Molecule:** `C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)O`
     - **Predicted Loading:** Low
     - **Experimental Loading:** High
     - **Notable Negative SHAP Values:**
       - **Rule 2:** **-0.3532**
       - **Rule 12:** **-0.2248**
     - **Interpretation:** Similar to the previous molecule, Rule 2 significantly underestimates the loading.

2. **Overestimated Loading (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecule:** `C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O`
     - **Predicted Loading:** High
     - **Experimental Loading:** Low
     - **Notable Positive SHAP Values:**
       - **Rule 10:** **0.0902**
       - **Rule 9:** **0.0367**
       - **Rule 6:** **0.0230**
     - **Interpretation:** Rule 10 contributes most to the overestimation of loading, potentially overstating the impact of features it captures.

   - **Molecule:** `C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN`
     - **Predicted Loading:** High
     - **Experimental Loading:** Low
     - **Notable Positive SHAP Values:**
       - **Rule 10:** **0.0902**

       - **Rule 6:** **0.0102**
     - **Interpretation:** Rule 10 is a significant factor in the overprediction.

**Interpretation of Accuracy and SHAP Analysis:**

- **Rule 2:** Tends to have high negative SHAP values in cases where the model underestimates the loading. This suggests that Rule 2 may be too restrictive or misrepresenting the impact of certain molecular features.
- **Rule 10:** Often has high positive SHAP values in overestimation cases, indicating it may be overemphasizing the influence of specific features.
- **Rule 12:** Also associated with large negative SHAP values in underestimations, suggesting the need for refinement.

The SHAP analysis reveals that certain rules are consistently contributing to misclassifications, either by undervaluing or overvaluing the impact of specific functional groups or molecular structures.

**Conclusion:**

The current rules are not as effective as previous iterations, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy and the identification of problematic rules through SHAP analysis. The model seems to be underfitting, failing to capture critical patterns necessary for accurate predictions.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to improve the current rules:

1. **Refine Rule 2:**

   - **Issue Identified:** Rule 2 is contributing significantly to underestimating the loading in molecules where the experimental loading is high. The high negative SHAP values suggest that the rule may be too penalizing.

**Summary of Discussions and Suggestions for Optimizing Current Rules**

**Introduction**

The current set of rules aims to predict the yield (high or low) of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on the structural features of molecular modifiers. Recent analyses have highlighted areas where the rules can be improved to enhance predictive accuracy and generalizability. The focus is on refining SMARTS patterns, correcting rule definitions, and addressing issues identified through performance metrics and SHAP analysis.

---

**Key Points from the Discussion**

1. **Performance Metrics Indicate Decline in Accuracy**

   - **Validation Accuracy Decrease**: The current validation accuracy is **65.7%**, a decline from previous accuracies of **76%**, indicating that the model's performance has deteriorated.
   - **Underfitting**: The decrease in accuracy suggests that the model may be underfitting, not capturing essential patterns necessary for accurate predictions.
   - **SHAP Analysis**: SHAP values have identified specific rules that contribute significantly to misclassifications, both overestimations and underestimations of modifier loading on the catalyst.

2. **Specific Issues with the Current Rules**

   - **Rule 2**: The SMARTS patterns are too restrictive, only matching specific nitrogen positions in pyridine rings, and may miss other relevant heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms.
   - **Rule 3**: Undefined variables like 'Halogen' lead to errors. Incorrect SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing groups result in improper matching.
   - **Rule 4**: The pattern for aliphatic carboxylic acids is too specific, failing to generalize across chains of varying lengths and missing coordinating groups in different positions.
   - **Rule 5**: Patterns do not ensure that polar substituents are at terminal positions, potentially misclassifying modifiers.
   - **Rule 7**: Does not distinguish between high and low yields based on the position of electron-donating substituents, leading to variable and inaccurate predictions.
   - **Rule 10 and Rule 12**: Associated with significant misclassifications according to SHAP analysis, indicating a need for refinement.
   - **SMARTS Pattern Issues**: General problems include undefined variables and patterns not conforming to SMARTS syntax, leading to incorrect matching and errors.

3. **Suggestions for Improving the Rules**

   - **Generalize SMARTS Patterns**: Modify patterns to be more inclusive. For Rule 2, use patterns that match any heteroaromatic ring containing nitrogen atoms.
   - **Define Variables Properly**: Ensure all variables in SMARTS patterns are defined within the code. For example, define 'Halogen' as '[F,Cl,Br,I]' in Rule 3.
   - **Correct Patterns for Functional Groups**: Update SMARTS patterns to accurately represent electron-withdrawing groups like nitro and carbonyl groups in Rule 3.
   - **Enhance Pattern Coverage in Rules 4 and 5**: Use more general patterns to cover longer chain lengths and ensure coordinating groups are detected anywhere along the chain.
   - **Incorporate Substituent Positions in Rule 7**: Modify the rule to account for the positions of electron-donating substituents and their impact on yield.
   - **Refine Problematic Rules**: Adjust Rules 2, 10, and 12, which have been identified as contributing to misclassifications.
   - **Validate SMARTS Patterns**: Use cheminformatics toolkits like RDKit to test and validate all SMARTS patterns for correctness.
   - **Implement Error Handling**: Incorporate error catching and logging mechanisms to identify and correct issues during execution.
   - **Consider Additional Chemical Features**: Include factors such as resonance structures, tautomers, steric effects, and three-dimensional geometry.

4. **Analysis of Rule Performance Using SHAP Values**

   - **Underestimations and Overestimations**: SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules (e.g., Rules 2, 10, and 12) are consistently contributing to incorrect predictions.
   - **Negative SHAP Values**: High negative SHAP values for some rules suggest they are overly penalizing certain features.
   - **Positive SHAP Values**: High positive SHAP values may indicate overestimation of the impact of certain features.

---

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

1. **Refine and Generalize SMARTS Patterns**

   - **Rule 2**: Expand the SMARTS patterns to match a broader range of heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms. Use patterns like `[c,n]1[c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n]1` for six-membered rings and include five-membered rings.
   - **Rule 3**: Correct the patterns to accurately match electron-withdrawing groups. Define 'Halogen' explicitly within the pattern (e.g., `[F,Cl,Br,I]`) and update nitro groups to `[c][N+](=O)[O-]`.
   - **Rules 4 and 5**: Adjust patterns to generalize carbon chain lengths using `{}` brackets (e.g., `[CH2]{2,5}`) and ensure that polar substituents are correctly positioned.

2. **Define Variables and Correct Syntax**

   - **Proper Variable Definitions**: Ensure all variables used in SMARTS patterns are defined within the code to prevent mismatches and errors.
   - **SMARTS Syntax Validation**: Use cheminformatics tools to validate each SMARTS pattern for correctness and conformity to the syntax.

3. **Adjust Rule Logic and Definitions**

   - **Rule 7**: Modify the rule to account for the positions of electron-donating substituents (ortho, meta, para) on the aromatic ring relative to the carboxylic acid group.
   - **Rule 10**: Review the impact of acylated amino acids on metal coordination, adjusting the rule to reflect cases where acylation may not hinder coordination due to other molecular features.
   - **Rule 12**: Differentiate between steric hindrance that affects coordination and bulkiness that does not by considering the position and nature of bulky substituents.

4. **Implement Error Handling and Logging**

   - **Error Catching**: Incorporate mechanisms to catch and report parsing errors or unmatched patterns, aiding in the identification and correction of issues.
   - **Logging**: Maintain logs of errors and mismatches to facilitate debugging and refinement of the rules.

5. **Enhance Model Generalizability**

   - **Avoid Overgeneralization**: Balance specificity and generality in the rules to capture essential features without oversimplifying.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to test the rules on different subsets of data, ensuring consistent performance and preventing overfitting.

6. **Consider Additional Molecular Features**

   - **Functional Group Interactions**: Analyze synergistic effects of functional groups and incorporate them into the rules where relevant.
   - **Three-Dimensional Structures**: Consider the spatial arrangement of atoms and how it may influence metal coordination and catalytic activity.

7. **Consult Domain Experts**

   - **Chemical Expertise**: Work with chemists to validate rules and gain insights into subtle chemical effects that may not be evident from data analysis alone.

8. **Expand Data Coverage**

   - **Increase Train Support**: Develop additional rules to cover more data points, improving the model's applicability.
   - **Include Diverse Molecules**: Broaden the dataset to include a wider variety of molecular structures, enhancing the robustness of the rules.

---

**Judgment on Further Optimization Possibility**

There is significant potential for further optimizing the current rules without overfitting. The model shows signs of underfitting, and the adjustments outlined above are aimed at refining the rules to better capture the relationships between molecular features and catalytic yield. By carefully modifying the SMARTS patterns, correcting rule definitions, and incorporating additional chemical insights, the predictive accuracy of the model can be improved.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by thoroughly analyzing the provided dataset and correlating the structural features of the molecular modifiers with the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines specific substructures (functional groups) and considers underlying physical-chemical properties such as coordination abilities, electronic and steric effects, potential side reactions, and catalyst interactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This systematic approach aids in selecting appropriate modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the reaction, balancing the need for effective coordination with the catalyst and minimizing unfavorable interactions.

The generated rules prioritize coverage of the dataset, balancing simplicity and complexity to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different molecular features influence the reaction outcome. This allows for informed decisions when designing or selecting modifiers for similar catalytic systems.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine and Generalize SMARTS Patterns in Rule 2**

  - **Action**: Modify the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 2** to match a broader range of heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use a more general SMARTS pattern for heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen, such as `[$([nX2]):1]:[$([c,n]):2]:[$([c,n]):3]:[$([c,n]):4]:[$([c,n]):5]:[$([c,n]):6]` to match various nitrogen positions in six-membered rings.
    - Include patterns for five-membered rings like pyrazole: `[n;H1]1cc[nH]c1` or more generally `[nX2]1[c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n]1`.
  - **Benefit**: This generalization will capture more modifiers that fit the criteria, improving rule coverage and predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 2**: **Define Variables Properly Within SMARTS Patterns**

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule considers combinations of substructures (functional groups) and their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Rephrase Rules Using Quantifiable Molecular Descriptors**

  Rewrite the existing rules in terms of quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers that contain both an amino group and a carboxylic acid group on an aliphatic chain," specify this as "Modifiers with a count of 1 amino group and 1 carboxylic acid group attached to a linear aliphatic chain of X carbons." This allows for the creation of numerical features like counts of specific functional groups and chain lengths.

- **Advice 2**: **Implement SMARTS Patterns for Functional Groups**

  Develop SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns corresponding to each functional group or structural motif mentioned in the rules. This enables automated parsing of SMILES strings to identify and quantify the presence of these groups. For instance, create SMARTS patterns for amino acids, heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms, electron-withdrawing substituents, etc.

- **Advice 3**: **Consolidate Similar Rules to Reduce Redundancy**

  Identify and merge rules that overlap or are similar in nature to simplify the ruleset. For example, Rules 1 and 4 both deal with modifiers containing amino and carboxylic acid groups but differ in chain length or additional coordinating groups. Consolidate them into a single rule that accounts for these variations with specified parameters.

- **Advice 4**: **Express Rules in Terms of Numerical Thresholds**

  Where applicable, define rules using numerical thresholds for molecular properties. For example, "Modifiers with a LogP value between X and Y tend to result in high yield," or "Modifiers with a topological polar surface area (TPSA) above Z." This approach facilitates the generation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors Calculable from SMILES**

  Utilize molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, LogP, TPSA, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, rotatable bonds, and aromatic ring counts. These descriptors can be computed directly from SMILES and used to create a comprehensive feature matrix for modeling.

- **Advice 6**: **Simplify Complex Rules by Focusing on Key Functional Groups**

  For rules with multiple functional groups or complex structures, prioritize the functional groups that have the most significant impact on yield. Simplify the rules by focusing on these key features to reduce complexity and improve their applicability.

- **Advice 7**: **Eliminate or Rework Rules with Limited Data Support**

  Remove rules that are overly specific or cover very few data points, as they may not be statistically significant. Alternatively, adjust these rules to be more general, increasing their coverage of the dataset.

- **Advice 8**: **Validate and Refine Rules Using Statistical Methods**

  Use statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to test the predictive power of each rule against the dataset. Apply methods like decision trees or random forests to identify the most important features and refine the rules accordingly.

- **Advice 9**: **Address Contradictions and Exceptions in the Dataset**

  Examine instances where the current rules do not accurately predict the yield (e.g., compounds that are exceptions to the rules). Analyze these cases to identify missing factors or revise the rules to accommodate these exceptions.

- **Advice 10**: **Ensure Rules Are Compatible with Numerical Modeling**

  Design rules that can be directly translated into numerical features without ambiguities. Avoid subjective terms and ensure that any qualitative descriptors are quantified. This alignment with numerical modeling practices will facilitate the creation of predictive models.

- **Advice 11**: **Use Hierarchical Rule Structures**

  Organize the rules in a hierarchical manner, starting from general properties to more specific features. This structure aids in feature prioritization during modeling and helps in understanding the relative importance of different molecular features.

- **Advice 12**: **Integrate Physicochemical Properties Related to Reaction Mechanism**

  Incorporate descriptors that are directly related to the reaction mechanism, such as electron density, coordination number, and steric parameters like the Taft steric parameter or Verloop parameters. These can provide insights into how modifiers influence the catalyst and reaction outcome.

- **Advice 13**: **Include Negative Rules as Absence of Features**

  Represent negative rules (e.g., "Modifiers lacking amino groups tend to result in low yield") as the absence or low count of certain features in the numerical matrix. This helps in capturing both the presence and absence of critical functional groups.

- **Advice 14**: **Automate Feature Extraction from SMILES**

  Develop or utilize existing tools to automate the extraction of molecular descriptors and functional group counts from SMILES strings based on the defined rules and SMARTS patterns. Automation ensures consistency and efficiency in feature matrix generation.

- **Advice 15**: **Iteratively Refine Rules Based on Model Performance**

  Use the generated feature matrix to build preliminary predictive models. Analyze model performance to identify which features and corresponding rules contribute most to prediction accuracy. Refine the rules iteratively based on these insights.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect increases the acidity of the carboxylic acid but also enhances hydrophobicity and may disrupt interactions with the catalyst. Fluorinated chains can also decrease solubility in the reaction medium.

  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with acylated amino groups**, such as **N-acetylated amino acids**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Amino acids where the amino group is blocked by an acyl group, reducing the number of available coordination sites.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Acylation of the amino group prevents it from participating in metal coordination, reducing chelation and weakening interaction with the catalyst.

  - *Example*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **functional groups that may cause catalyst deactivation**, such as **thiol groups on aromatic rings**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic carboxylic acids with strongly coordinating groups capable of irreversibly binding to the metal center.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Strongly coordinating groups like thiols can bind tightly to metal ions, potentially poisoning the catalyst by blocking active sites needed for the reaction.

  - *Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that have **bulky aromatic side chains**, such as **phenyl or indole groups**, especially when attached to amino acids, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Amino acids with large, hydrophobic aromatic side chains that can cause steric hindrance.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Bulky side chains may interfere with proper coordination to the metal center due to steric crowding, reducing catalyst efficiency.

  - *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents**, where the electron-donating effects dominate, tend to result in **variable or low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic rings with mixed substituents that may counteract each other's electronic effects, leading to unpredictable coordination behavior.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Conflicting electronic effects can make the carboxylic acid's ability to coordinate with the metal center less predictable, affecting the catalyst's performance.

  - *Example*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **multiple functional groups that may compete for or disrupt binding**, such as **peptide-like structures or complex amino acid derivatives**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Molecules with several different functional groups that could interfere with each other's ability to coordinate to the metal.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Competing coordination sites or internal interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding) may reduce the overall availability of the modifier to effectively interact with the catalyst.

  - *Example*:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule considers combinations of substructures (functional groups) and their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2** to account for steric hindrance caused by additional aromatic rings or substituents that may reduce yield despite the presence of coordinating nitrogen atoms. Modify the rule to exclude heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents that could interfere with metal coordination. Specifically, indicate that while nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids generally yield high, compounds like **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) result in low yield due to steric hindrance from the additional aromatic ring. Adjust the rule to consider both electronic and steric factors.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust Rule 3** to specify that not all electron-withdrawing groups contribute positively to yield. Acknowledge that certain electron-withdrawing substituents, such as the **formyl (-CHO)** group adjacent to the aromatic ring, may engage in side reactions or form inactive complexes with the catalyst, leading to low yield. Modify the rule to exclude modifiers like **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18), emphasizing that aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids can have detrimental effects.

- **Advice 3**: **Reevaluate Rule 5** due to limited data support and contradictions with other rules. Since **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 14) yields high but conflicts with Rule 13, consider merging Rule 5 with a refined version of Rule 2 or Rule 13. Recognize that amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles can still result in high yield due to effective coordination through the heterocycle, despite potential steric hindrance.

- **Advice 4**: **Revise Rule 7** to account for exceptions like **octanoic acid** (Entry 5), which yields high despite being a long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acid without additional coordinating groups. Modify the rule to specify that while long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids generally result in low yield due to steric hindrance and solubility issues, certain straight-chain acids like octanoic acid may still interact effectively with the catalyst. Introduce a threshold or consider chain flexibility and hydrophobic interactions that may facilitate catalyst interaction.

- **Advice 5**: **Modify Rule 13** to reflect that steric hindrance from bulky side chains does not always result in low yield if the bulky group contains additional coordinating functionalities. Recognize that compounds like **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 14) yield high due to the indole ring's ability to coordinate with the metal center. Adjust the rule to focus on modifiers where bulky side chains lack coordinating groups, emphasizing that steric hindrance coupled with a lack of additional coordination sites leads to low yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Consolidate rules with limited data support (Rules 10, 11, 12, and 15)** into broader rules or classify them as tentative observations. For example, incorporate the effects of fluorinated chains and acylated amino groups into a general rule about modifiers that significantly alter electronic properties or block key coordination sites leading to low yield. This streamlines the rule set and focuses on well-supported patterns.

- **Advice 7**: **Remove or revise Rule 14** since the provided example contradicts the rule. Since **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) results in high yield, it suggests that the presence of both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents does not necessarily lead to low or variable yield. Investigate the specific electronic and steric interplay in such compounds to develop a more accurate rule or acknowledge that mixed substituents require case-by-case analysis.

- **Advice 8**: **Increase data coverage for underrepresented rules** by gathering more experimental results. For rules like 5, 10, 11, 12, and 15, additional data points will help validate or refute these rules. A larger dataset will enhance the reliability of the rules and may reveal new patterns or exceptions that refine the rule set.

- **Advice 9**: **Emphasize the balance between coordination ability and steric effects in the rules**. Since some bulky modifiers yield high due to strong coordination (e.g., through heterocycles), modify the rules to reflect that effective metal coordination can mitigate steric hindrance. Clarify that the presence of strong coordinating groups may override the negative impact of bulkiness on yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Incorporate exceptions and clarify conditions within the rules**. For each rule, explicitly mention known exceptions and the conditions under which they occur. This improves the predictive power of the rules and provides practical guidance on their applicability. Including limitations and specifying when a rule does not apply will help prevent misclassification of modifiers.

  - *Chemical Features*: Heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms and a carboxylic acid group, providing multiple coordination sites.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic systems act as Lewis bases, coordinating to metal centers and enhancing catalyst-ligand interactions. The aromatic system can delocalize electron density, stabilizing the metal complex.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (4-Pyridone-2-carboxylic acid)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halogens (e.g., bromo, chloro)**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic rings bearing a carboxylic acid group and electron-withdrawing substituents that increase the acidity of the carboxyl group.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid, increasing its ability to coordinate with metal ions. This strengthens metal-ligand interactions and promotes catalytic efficiency.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (up to 6 carbons) with additional coordinating groups**, such as **thiol (-SH)** or **hydroxyl (-OH)** groups, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Short aliphatic chains with a carboxylic acid group and other functional groups capable of coordinating with metal centers.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Additional coordinating groups provide multiple binding sites, enhancing chelation. Short chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing effective interaction with the metal center.

  - *Examples*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains containing additional nitrogen heterocycles**, such as **tryptophan derivatives**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Amino acids with side chains that include additional nitrogen-containing heterocycles capable of coordinating to metal centers.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: The indole ring in tryptophan can participate in π-interactions and coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

  - *Example*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents**, such as **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **methoxy (-OCH₃)** groups, especially when positioned ortho or para to the carboxyl group, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic rings with a carboxylic acid group and electron-donating substituents that decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Electron-donating groups reduce the acidity and electron-withdrawing character of the carboxylic acid, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal ions. Steric effects from substituents may also hinder coordination.

  - *Examples*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
    - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (7 or more carbons) without additional coordinating groups**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking other polar or coordinating groups.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Long hydrophobic chains increase steric hindrance and reduce solubility in the reaction medium, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid**, such as **formylbenzoic acids** and **β-keto acids**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Carboxylic acids with carbonyl groups that can participate in side reactions or coordinate differently with metal centers.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Aldehyde and ketone groups may form stable complexes with the metal catalyst or undergo side reactions, reducing catalyst availability and efficiency.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that contain **polyether chains** or **multiple ether linkages**, such as **polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatives**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Carboxylic acids incorporating ether bonds or polyether segments in their structure.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: The ether oxygen atoms may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or increase the flexibility and solvation of the molecule, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

  - *Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids**, especially those with multiple **fluorine atoms**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with extensive fluorination along the carbon chain.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect increases the acidity of the carboxylic acid but also enhances hydrophobicity and may disrupt interactions with the catalyst. Fluorinated chains can also decrease solubility in the reaction medium.

  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with acylated amino groups**, such as **N-acetylated amino acids**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Amino acids where the amino group is blocked by an acyl group, reducing the number of available coordination sites.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Acylation of the amino group prevents it from participating in metal coordination, reducing chelation and weakening interaction with the catalyst.

  - *Example*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **functional groups that may cause catalyst deactivation**, such as **thiol groups on aromatic rings**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic carboxylic acids with strongly coordinating groups capable of irreversibly binding to the metal center.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Strongly coordinating groups like thiols can bind tightly to metal ions, potentially poisoning the catalyst by blocking active sites needed for the reaction.

  - *Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that have **bulky aromatic side chains**, such as **phenyl or indole groups**, especially when attached to amino acids, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Amino acids with large, hydrophobic aromatic side chains that can cause steric hindrance.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Bulky side chains may interfere with proper coordination to the metal center due to steric crowding, reducing catalyst efficiency.

  - *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents**, where the electron-donating effects dominate, tend to result in **variable or low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic rings with mixed substituents that may counteract each other's electronic effects, leading to unpredictable coordination behavior.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Conflicting electronic effects can make the carboxylic acid's ability to coordinate with the metal center less predictable, affecting the catalyst's performance.

  - *Example*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **multiple functional groups that may compete for or disrupt binding**, such as **peptide-like structures or complex amino acid derivatives**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Molecules with several different functional groups that could interfere with each other's ability to coordinate to the metal.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Competing coordination sites or internal interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding) may reduce the overall availability of the modifier to effectively interact with the catalyst.

  - *Example*:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule considers combinations of substructures (functional groups) and their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: In Rule 1's code, the SMARTS pattern `'[NX3H2][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` is intended to match α-amino acids with a primary amine group (`[NX3H2]`). However, it incorrectly matches N-acetylated amino acids (e.g., SMILES index 34: `'CC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N'`), where the amino group is acylated and thus a secondary amine. To fix this, modify the nitrogen pattern to exclude amides by ensuring the nitrogen is not attached to a carbonyl group. You can use the SMARTS `'[NX3H2;!$(N-C=O)]'` to exclude acylated amines.

- **Suggestion 2**: The current code only includes Rules 1 to 8, while the full rule set contains 15 rules. To improve coverage, implement the remaining rules (Rules 9 to 15) in the code with appropriate SMARTS patterns and logic consistent with the initial rules.

- **Suggestion 3**: For Rule 4, the code uses patterns for carboxylic acids, hydroxyl, and thiol groups but does not ensure they are part of the same short-chain aliphatic backbone (≤6 carbons). This may result in false positives. Modify the pattern to specify that the hydroxyl or thiol group is connected to the same aliphatic chain as the carboxylic acid. For example, you can use a pattern like `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][C;X4][C;X4][OX2H1,SX2H]'` for a carboxylic acid connected to a chain with hydroxyl or thiol groups within the desired carbon count.

- **Suggestion 4**: In Rule 3's code, the subpatterns `'[c][F,Cl,Br,I]'` and `'[c][NX3](=O)[OX1]'` may not capture all electron-withdrawing groups or consider their positions relative to the carboxyl group. Enhance the subpatterns to include other strong electron-withdrawing groups like cyano (`-C≡N`), trifluoromethyl (`-CF₃`), and ensure they are ortho or para to the carboxyl group. Also, specify the relation to the carboxyl group in the pattern, e.g., `'[c:1][c:2][c:3][c:4][c:5][c:6][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` with electron-withdrawing groups on positions ortho or para to the carboxylate.

- **Suggestion 5**: For Rule 2, the patterns focus on pyridine rings but may miss other nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids (e.g., pyrazole derivatives). Expand the patterns to include other heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen, such as `'[nH0][c][c][c][c][nH0][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` for pyrazole, pyrimidine, or pyridazine rings with a carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 6**: In Rule 8, the patterns `'[CX3](=O)[CX3H1](=O)'` and `'[CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)'` may match non-adjacent carbonyl groups or unintended structures. Refine these patterns to ensure the aldehyde or ketone group is adjacent (alpha or beta) to the carboxylic acid. Use more specific patterns like `'[CX3](=O)[CX4H1][CX3](=O)'` for β-keto acids or include adjacency using the '.' (dot) notation to prevent matching across rings or branches.

- **Suggestion 7**: Implement explicit tests for each rule using known molecules that should match or not match the rule. This can be done by creating a test suite with representative SMILES for each case. It will help validate that the SMARTS patterns and code logic correctly implement the rules.

- **Suggestion 8**: Ensure that exclude patterns are thoroughly applied to prevent false positives. For instance, in Rule 1 and Rule 4, exclude aromatic compounds by including `'[a]'` in the exclude patterns. Also, consider excluding other functional groups that could interfere with the rule's intent, such as esters or amides in aliphatic rules.

- **Suggestion 9**: For Rule 5, the current pattern may not precisely capture amino acids with aromatic side chains containing additional nitrogen heterocycles like tryptophan. Modify the pattern to specifically include indole-containing amino acids, e.g., `'[NX3H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CX3H2][c]1[cH][n][cH][cH][cH]1'`, ensuring the side chain contains an indole ring.

- **Suggestion 10**: Use recursive SMARTS or introduce variable atom matching to capture complex substructures. For example, to match any aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents in Rule 6, you can use recursive SMARTS to define the aromatic ring and its substituents more flexibly.

- **Suggestion 11**: Add detailed comments and documentation within the code for each rule, explaining the rationale behind each SMARTS pattern and how it maps to the natural language rule. This will aid in future maintenance and help others understand and verify the implementation.

    -------------------------------------------------------

    
---------------------------------------------------------------
Metric Commenter Message:
Upon analyzing the performance of the current rules based on the provided metrics and comparing them to the reference metrics from previous iterations, several key observations emerge:

### **1. Increase in Confidence and Lift**

- **Confidence**:
  - **Previous Mean Train Confidence**: Approximately **58.74%**
    - Calculated from [0.6352, 0.5396].
  - **Current Mean Train Confidence**: Approximately **65.76%**
    - Calculated from [0.6733, 0.5667, 0.6819, 0.7083].
  - **Observation**: There is a noticeable increase in confidence, indicating that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of achieving the predicted outcome (high yield or low yield) has improved.

- **Lift**:
  - **Previous Mean Train Lift**: Approximately **1.13**
    - Calculated from [1.2048, 1.0559].
  - **Current Mean Train Lift**: Approximately **1.31**
    - Calculated from [1.3364, 1.1259, 1.3488, 1.4293].
  - **Observation**: An increased lift suggests that the rules have a stronger association between the conditions and the predictions than would be expected by chance. The higher lift values indicate more interesting and potentially valuable rules.

### **2. Decrease in Support**

- **Support**:
  - **Previous Mean Train Support**: Approximately **17.56%**
    - Calculated from [0.1667, 0.1845].
  - **Current Mean Train Support**: Approximately **2.64%**
    - Calculated from [0.0248, 0.0095, 0.0533, 0.0179].
  - **Observation**: There's a significant decrease in support, meaning the current rules cover a much smaller portion of the dataset. This reduction indicates that while the rules are more accurate when applied, they apply to fewer cases.

### **3. Leverage Considerations**

- **Leverage**:
  - **Previous Mean Train Leverage**: Approximately **0.0124**
    - Calculated from [0.0289, -0.0041].
  - **Current Mean Train Leverage**: Approximately **0.0080**
    - Calculated from [0.0076, 0.0046, 0.0126, 0.0073].
  - **Observation**: There's a slight decrease in leverage. While the values remain positive (indicating a stronger association than expected by chance), the decrease suggests the additional support the rules provide over random chance has diminished.

### **Analysis and Implications**

The improvements in **confidence** and **lift** suggest that the current rules are more reliable when they apply—the predictions are more likely to be correct, and the associations are stronger. However, the substantial decrease in **support** indicates that these rules are applicable to a much smaller subset of the data.

This trade-off often occurs when rules become too specific, capturing niche patterns that don't generalize across the broader dataset. The high confidence may be a result of overfitting, where the rules are tailored to specific instances rather than capturing general trends.

### **Local Minimum Consideration**

The current iteration shows:

- **Higher confidence and lift**, indicating better performance when rules are applicable.
- **Lower support**, suggesting limited applicability.

This pattern suggests that a local minimum may have been reached. The algorithm has optimized for confidence and lift at the expense of support. Continuing with the current approach may not yield significantly better results, as further iterations might only marginally increase confidence and lift while further decreasing support.

### **Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

To enhance the effectiveness of the rules, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Balance Between Specificity and Generalization**:
   - **Broaden Rule Conditions**: Re-express some rules to cover broader categories by identifying common features among high-yield modifiers. For example, instead of specifying exact substituents, focus on classes of functional groups.
   - **Example**: Combine rules that involve **aliphatic α-amino acids** into a single, more general rule that encompasses a wider range of similar compounds.

2. **Increase Support Without Sacrificing Too Much Confidence**:
   - **Relax Stringent Conditions**: Modify the rules to include modifiers that slightly deviate from the current strict criteria but still contribute to high yields.
   - **Careful Adjustment**: Ensure that relaxing conditions doesn't lead to a significant drop in confidence or introduce negative leverage.

3. **Simplify Complex Rules**:
   - **Eliminate Redundancies**: Merge overlapping rules or remove overly complex rules that may only apply to singular instances.
   - **Focus on Key Influencers**: Identify the most influential chemical features that contribute to high yield and center rules around them.

4. **Re-evaluate Low-Support Rules**:
   - **Assess Practical Value**: Determine if rules with very low support offer practical value. If not, consider removing or combining them with other rules.
   - **Potential Impact**: Rules that apply to very few cases may not justify their complexity, especially if they don't significantly improve overall outcomes.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data or Features**:
   - **Expand Dataset**: If possible, include more data to capture a wider variety of modifiers, which can help increase support.
   - **New Features**: Introduce additional chemical descriptors or properties that might better explain the yield variations and improve rule applicability.

6. **Use Cross-Validation**:
   - **Test for Overfitting**: Apply cross-validation techniques to ensure the rules generalize well to unseen data.
   - **Adjust Based on Results**: If overfitting is detected, prioritize generality over specificity in rule formulation.

7. **Iterative Refinement with Feedback Loops**:
   - **Monitor Metrics**: Continuously monitor how changes to the rules affect all metrics, not just confidence and lift.
   - **Set Thresholds**: Establish acceptable ranges for support, confidence, lift, and leverage to guide rule development.

### **Conclusion**

While the current rules demonstrate improved precision (higher confidence and lift), their practical applicability is limited due to the significant decrease in support. To enhance the overall performance and utility of the rules:

- **Aim for a Balanced Approach**: Strive for rules that offer a good balance between reliability (confidence and lift) and applicability (support).
- **Avoid Overfitting**: Ensure that the rules are not excessively tailored to specific data points at the expense of generalizability.
- **Further Iterations May Be Needed**: Considering the current metrics, additional iterations focusing on increasing support while maintaining reasonable confidence and lift are recommended.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be improved to better capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to more robust predictions and a deeper understanding of the factors influencing catalytic performance.

ML Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Performance of Current Rules:**

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

   - The latest 5-fold validation accuracy obtained is **51.43%**, which is a significant decrease compared to previous iterations where accuracies ranged from **60% to 76%**. This indicates that the current rules are **not effective enough** in predicting the catalyst modifier loading accurately.
   - The decrease in accuracy suggests that the modifications or iterations applied to the rules may have adversely affected the model's performance, possibly leading to a local minimum without improving generalization.

2. **Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   - The consistent drop in validation accuracy over iterations points towards **underfitting**. The current rules may be too simplistic or not adequately capturing the complexity and variability within the dataset.
   - The underfitting could be due to overgeneralized rules that fail to account for essential features influencing the catalyst's behavior, leading to poor performance on both training and validation sets.
   - There is no evidence of overfitting since the training accuracy (not provided) is likely not significantly higher than the validation accuracy. If it were, overfitting would be a concern.

3. **Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values:**

   - In the latest SHAP analysis, for molecules where the **predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high**, **Rule 4** consistently has a **negative SHAP value** for high loading.
     - **Examples:**
       - *Molecule*: `C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`
         - *Predicted Loading*: Low
         - *Experimental Loading*: High
         - *Rule 4 SHAP Value*: **-0.01984**
       - *Molecule*: `C1=CN=CC=C1CCCC(=O)O`
         - *Predicted Loading*: Low
         - *Experimental Loading*: High
         - *Rule 4 SHAP Value*: **-0.01984**
   - The negative SHAP values for Rule 4 indicate that this rule is strongly contributing to the model predicting a **low loading** when, in fact, the experimental loading is **high**. This suggests that **Rule 4 is problematic** and may be misrepresenting the relationship between molecular features and catalyst loading.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Changes:**

   - The decline in accuracy from previous iterations (60%–76%) to the current **51%** suggests that the current set of rules, particularly after recent modifications, is less effective.
   - The model appears to have reached a **local minimum** where further iterations are not improving performance, indicating that the **current approach may need significant revision** to enhance predictive capabilities.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

   - The SHAP analysis reveals that the model is **overly reliant on Rule 4**, as it's the only rule contributing significant SHAP values in the latest iteration.
   - Other rules are not influencing predictions, implying that they may not be effectively implemented in the feature matrix or are being overshadowed by Rule 4.
   - The consistent negative contribution of Rule 4 in cases of underestimation (predicted low, experimental high) suggests that the rule may be incorrectly penalizing certain molecular features that are actually associated with high catalyst loading.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Rule 4:**

   - **Re-examine the Definition of Rule 4:**
     - **Current Definition**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (up to 6 carbons) with additional coordinating groups**, such as **thiol (-SH)** or **hydroxyl (-OH)** groups, tend to result in **high yield**.
     - **Issue Identified**: Rule 4 is contributing negatively to high loading predictions, contradicting its intended purpose.
   - **Adjust Rule 4 for Better Alignment:**
     - **Consider Revising the Scope**: Perhaps the rule is too broad and includes modifiers that do not lead to high yield. Narrowing the rule to exclude certain functional groups or structural features may improve accuracy.
     - **Check for Misclassification**: Ensure that the additional coordinating groups are correctly identified in the feature extraction. There may be errors in detecting -SH or -OH groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid within short-chain aliphatic acids.
     - **Update Rule Implementation**: Modify how Rule 4 is encoded in the feature matrix to accurately reflect its definition and desired positive contribution to high loading predictions.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**

   - **Identify Other Problematic Rules**: Although the current SHAP analysis highlights only Rule 4, previous analyses included other rules with negative SHAP values in cases of underestimation or overestimation.
   - **Refine or Remove Ineffective Rules**: If certain rules consistently contribute negatively to correct predictions, consider refining their definitions or implementation. If they cannot be adjusted effectively, it may be prudent to remove them to reduce their negative impact on the model.

3. **Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting:**

   - **Enhance Rule Coverage**: Develop additional rules that capture other relevant chemical features influencing catalyst loading. This could involve analyzing mismatches between predictions and experimental results to identify missing patterns.
   - **Increase Model Complexity Appropriately**: While the simplicity of rules is valuable, the model may need more complex representations to capture the nuances of the data. Consider incorporating interaction terms or higher-level features derived from existing rules.
   - **Balance Rule Contributions**: Implement methods to ensure that no single rule (e.g., Rule 4) dominates the model's predictions. Techniques such as regularization or feature weighting can promote a more balanced contribution from all rules.

4. **Iteratively Refine Rules Based on SHAP Insights:**

   - **Use SHAP Analysis for Targeted Improvements**: Although direct modification of rules based solely on SHAP values is not recommended, the insights can guide where refinements are necessary.
     - **For Overestimated Loadings**: If certain rules have high positive SHAP values contributing to overestimations (predicted high, experimental low), these rules may need to be tightened or made more specific.
     - **For Underestimated Loadings**: Rules with high negative SHAP values in underestimations (predicted low, experimental high), like Rule 4, should be re-evaluated to better capture the factors leading to high loading.
   - **Monitor Rule Adjustments**: After making changes to rules, re-express the feature matrix and retrain the model. Use SHAP analysis after each iteration to assess the impact of adjustments.

5. **Enhance Feature Matrix Representation:**

   - **Ensure Accurate Feature Extraction**: Verify that the feature matrix correctly represents the presence or absence of substructures defined by the rules. Any inaccuracies in feature extraction can lead to misrepresentations in the model.
   - **Consider Additional Features**: Beyond the current rules, incorporate features such as molecular weight, lipophilicity (logP), electronic properties, or steric hindrance factors that may influence catalyst loading.
   - **Implement Feature Engineering**: Explore transformations or combinations of existing features to capture complex relationships that may not be apparent with individual features.

6. **Validate Rules with Domain Expertise:**

   - **Consult Chemical Experts**: Engage with chemists or domain experts to validate the rules and ensure they align with known chemical principles and empirical observations.
   - **Update Rules Based on Experimental Evidence**: Use experimental data to inform rule modifications, ensuring that the rules are grounded in chemical reality and not just statistical patterns.

7. **Employ Cross-Validation Techniques:**

   - **Use Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation**: This can provide a more robust assessment of model performance and help detect overfitting or underfitting issues.
   - **Analyze Performance Across Folds**: Look for consistent patterns in mispredictions across different folds to identify systematic issues with the rules or feature representations.

8. **Increase Dataset Diversity:**

   - **Expand the Dataset**: If feasible, include more molecules in the dataset to provide the model with a broader range of examples. A more diverse dataset can improve model generalization.
   - **Balance the Classes**: Ensure that there is an adequate representation of both high and low loading cases to prevent bias in the model.

**Conclusion:**

- The current model's performance indicates that the **rules need significant refinement**, particularly **Rule 4**, which is contributing negatively to predictions where it should be positive.
- By addressing the specific issues identified with Rule 4, adjusting other problematic rules, and enhancing the overall feature representation, the model's predictive accuracy can be improved.
- Iterative refinement, guided by SHAP analysis and grounded in chemical understanding, will help develop a set of rules that better capture the complex relationships governing catalyst modifier loading.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules:**

The recent analysis of the current rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction using various molecular modifiers has highlighted several key issues:

1. **Decrease in Model Performance:**
   - The latest 5-fold validation accuracy has dropped to **51.43%**, compared to previous accuracies of **60% to 76%**. This indicates that the current rules are not effectively capturing the determinants of high or low yield in the reaction.
   
2. **Problematic Rule Identified (Rule 4):**
   - **Rule 4**, which states that modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional coordinating groups (such as thiol or hydroxyl groups) tend to result in **high yield**, is contributing negatively to the predictions.
   - SHAP analysis shows that Rule 4 has negative SHAP values for molecules where the experimental yield is high but the model predicts a low yield, indicating that Rule 4 is misclassifying these cases.

3. **Underfitting Issues:**
   - The decrease in accuracy suggests underfitting, where the model is too simplistic and does not capture the complexities of the data.
   - The rules may be overly generalized or not sufficiently discriminative to account for the variability in the dataset.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Rule 4:**
   - **Re-express Rule 4** to better reflect the observed data, ensuring that it correctly identifies modifiers leading to high yield.
   - **Modify the SMARTS pattern** associated with Rule 4 to accurately capture short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional coordinating groups, and ensure that aromatic compounds are excluded if necessary.
   - **Validate Rule 4** by testing it against known molecules to confirm that it predicts high yield when appropriate.

2. **Adjust or Remove Ineffective Rules:**
   - **Identify Rules with Negative Impact:** Other than Rule 4, examine any rules that consistently contribute negatively to correct predictions.
   - **Refine These Rules:** Modify their definitions or SMARTS patterns to better align with the chemical properties influencing yield.
   - **Remove If Necessary:** If a rule cannot be effectively adjusted, consider removing it to prevent it from negatively impacting model performance.

3. **Balance Specificity and Generalization:**
   - **Broaden Overly Specific Rules:** Adjust rules that are too narrow and cover only a small portion of the data to increase their support.
   - **Increase Model Complexity Where Appropriate:** Incorporate additional relevant chemical features or interaction terms to capture more nuanced patterns.

4. **Enhance Feature Representation:**
   - **Ensure Accurate Feature Extraction:** Verify that all SMARTS patterns are correctly implemented and that the feature matrix accurately reflects the presence of key substructures.
   - **Introduce Additional Features:** Consider adding molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, lipophilicity (logP), electronic properties, or steric factors that may influence the reaction yield.

5. **Improve Rule Coverage:**
   - **Implement Remaining Rules:** Ensure that all rules (Rules 9 to 15) are implemented with appropriate SMARTS patterns to improve coverage and potentially increase support.
   - **Expand Patterns in Existing Rules:** For example, in Rule 2, include other heteroaromatic rings beyond pyridine derivatives by expanding SMARTS patterns to capture pyrazole, pyrimidine, or pyridazine rings.

6. **Iterative Refinement Based on SHAP Analysis:**
   - **Use SHAP Values to Guide Adjustments:** Continuously analyze SHAP values to identify rules that contribute negatively or positively and adjust them accordingly.
   - **Balance Rule Contributions:** Ensure that no single rule disproportionately influences the model predictions.

7. **Validate Rules with Expert Knowledge:**
   - **Consult Domain Experts:** Engage with chemists to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules and their alignment with known reaction mechanisms.
   - **Update Rules Based on Chemical Principles:** Modify rules to better reflect the underlying chemistry, ensuring they are grounded in experimental observations.

8. **Test Rules Thoroughly:**
   - **Create a Test Suite:** Develop a set of molecules with known yields to test each rule individually, verifying that they behave as expected.
   - **Monitor Rule Performance:** Keep track of how each rule affects the model's predictions and make adjustments as needed.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

Yes, there is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The issues identified, such as the problematic influence of Rule 4 and the exclusion of several rules (Rules 9 to 15) from implementation, suggest that the model is currently underfitting. By refining the existing rules, correctly implementing all intended rules, and ensuring accurate feature extraction, the model's performance can be improved. Careful adjustments aimed at better capturing the underlying chemical factors influencing yield, while avoiding excessive complexity, can enhance predictive accuracy without leading to overfitting.

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that have **bulky aromatic side chains**, such as **phenyl or indole groups**, especially when attached to amino acids, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Amino acids with large, hydrophobic aromatic side chains that can cause steric hindrance.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Bulky side chains may interfere with proper coordination to the metal center due to steric crowding, reducing catalyst efficiency.

  - *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents**, where the electron-donating effects dominate, tend to result in **variable or low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Aromatic rings with mixed substituents that may counteract each other's electronic effects, leading to unpredictable coordination behavior.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Conflicting electronic effects can make the carboxylic acid's ability to coordinate with the metal center less predictable, affecting the catalyst's performance.

  - *Example*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **multiple functional groups that may compete for or disrupt binding**, such as **peptide-like structures or complex amino acid derivatives**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - *Chemical Features*: Molecules with several different functional groups that could interfere with each other's ability to coordinate to the metal.

  - *Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties*: Competing coordination sites or internal interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding) may reduce the overall availability of the modifier to effectively interact with the catalyst.

  - *Example*:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule considers combinations of substructures (functional groups) and their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.---------------------------------------------------------------

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule considers combinations of substructures (functional groups) and their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* is clear in identifying amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains. The physical-chemical properties are explained through the coordination ability of the indole ring's nitrogen atom. However, the coverage is limited, with only one supporting data point—**(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)—in the dataset. This weakens the rule's robustness and suggests the need for additional data to strengthen coverage.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* lacks clarity due to contradictions with the dataset. While it states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents tend to result in low yield, the dataset shows that **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** results in a **high yield**. This inconsistency indicates insufficient property insight and misalignment with empirical data. The rule may require revision to accurately reflect the observed outcomes.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* presents issues with clarity and coverage. It claims that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups yield low results. However, the dataset shows that **octanoic acid** results in a **high yield**, contradicting the rule. This inconsistency undermines the rule's validity and suggests that the underlying physical-chemical properties are not adequately accounted for, necessitating refinement.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* is clear and provides sound property insight into how aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid can lead to low yield due to potential side reactions or altered coordination.

Additional data points are needed for better coverage.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* lacks clarity due to its broad scope, mentioning complex structures or multiple competing functional groups without specific structural criteria. The property insight is general, and the rule may overlap with other rules, causing potential confusion. Coverage is unclear, and without specific examples linked to the dataset, it's difficult to assess the rule's validity. The balance between complexity and clarity needs improvement.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* may overlap with *Rule 8*, focusing on modifiers with ketone groups within aliphatic chains. While the rule is clear, the property insight is similar to that of *Rule 8*, possibly making it redundant. Coverage is limited, with only **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** as a supporting data point. This reduces the rule's robustness and suggests that it could be merged with *Rule 8* for better coherence.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2 to Address Exceptions**

  - **Issue**: Rule 2 states that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring tend to result in high yield. However, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) results in low yield, contradicting the rule.
  
  - **Action**: Investigate additional structural features that may affect yield, such as substitution patterns that increase steric hindrance or electronic effects. Modify Rule 2 to account for such exceptions, possibly by specifying the position of the nitrogen atom and any substituents on the aromatic ring that impact the coordination ability.

- **Advice 2**: **Re-evaluate Rule 5 Due to Limited Data Support**

  - **Issue**: Rule 5 is supported by only one data point—**(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**—which limits its robustness.
  
  - **Action**: Consider merging Rule 5 with other rules that involve amino acids with aromatic side chains or gathering more data to strengthen the rule. Alternatively, re-assess whether this rule reflects a significant pattern or if the observed high yield is due to unique properties of the example provided.

- **Advice 3**: **Revise Rule 6 to Resolve Contradictions**

  - **Issue**: Rule 6 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents tend to result in low yield. However, **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 6) yields high, contradicting the rule.
  
  - **Action**: Modify Rule 6 to incorporate additional structural factors that influence yield, such as chain length or the presence of other coordinating groups. The rule could specify that the negative effect of electron-donating groups can be mitigated by additional factors like extended aliphatic chains or secondary coordinating sites.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rule 7 in Light of Contradictory Data**

  - **Issue**: Rule 7 claims that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups tend to result in low yield, but **octanoic acid** (Entry 5) yields high.
  
  - **Action**: Re-express Rule 7 to consider exceptions. Investigate whether factors such as the absence of steric hindrance due to the unbranched chain of octanoic acid affect the yield positively. Adjust the rule to indicate that while many long-chain acids result in low yield, simple unbranched chains like octanoic acid may still yield high due to favorable interaction with the catalyst.

- **Advice 5**: **Consolidate Rules with Limited Data Support**

  - **Issue**: Rules 10, 11, 12, and 13 each have limited support, often based on a single data point.
  
  - **Action**: Combine these rules into broader categories to increase their applicability and robustness. For example, create a general rule about modifiers causing steric hindrance or containing groups that block coordination sites leading to low yield. Alternatively, prioritize obtaining more experimental data to validate these rules.

- **Advice 6**: **Enhance Clarity and Specificity of Rule 14**

  - **Issue**: Rule 14 lacks clarity and provides a broad statement about complex structures with multiple functional groups resulting in low yield, but the example contradicts the rule.

- **Advice 7**: **Merge Overlapping Rules**

  - **Issue**: Rules 8 and 15 both address modifiers containing ketone groups leading to low yield.
  
  - **Action**: Merge these rules into a single, more comprehensive rule about modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups that interfere with metal coordination. This will reduce redundancy and improve the rule set's coherence.

- **Advice 8**: **Address Contradictions in Rule 13**

  - **Issue**: Rule 13 states that amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains tend to result in low yield, but **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan, Entry 14) results in high yield.
  
  - **Action**: Refine Rule 13 to account for exceptions. Consider that certain bulky side chains might provide additional coordination benefits that outweigh steric hindrance. Modify the rule to indicate that while steric hindrance can reduce yield, the presence of coordinating heteroatoms in bulky side chains may enhance yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Prioritize Rules with Strong Data Support**

  - **Issue**: Some rules are based on limited or conflicting data.
  
  - **Action**: Focus on developing and refining rules that are well-supported by multiple data points and have clear structure-property relationships. De-emphasize or remove rules that lack sufficient data or have notable exceptions until more evidence is available.

- **Advice 10**: **Integrate Contextual Molecular Features**

  - **Issue**: Current rules may not fully account for the overall molecular context and how different functional groups interact within a modifier.
  
  - **Action**: In rule formulation, consider the combined effects of all functional groups and their positions within the molecule. Develop rules that reflect the synergistic or antagonistic interactions between different substituents, leading to more accurate predictions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents**, such as **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **methoxy (-OCH₃)** groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and **electron-donating groups** that decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-donating substituents reduce the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with the metal center, weakening the metal-ligand interaction and decreasing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains** or **multiple ether linkages** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids with **ether bonds (-O-)** in their structure, creating **flexible polyether chains**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The ether oxygen atoms may interfere with the coordination between the carboxyl group and the metal center. The increased flexibility and solvation can reduce effective interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids** or have **blocked amino groups** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group is acylated or modified**, such as forming an **amide bond**, reducing the number of available coordination sites.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Blocking the amino group prevents it from coordinating with the metal center, diminishing chelation and weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids**, especially those with multiple **fluorine atoms**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a high degree of **fluorination** along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect increases the acidity of the carboxylic acid but can also enhance hydrophobicity and decrease solubility in the reaction medium. The altered electronic properties may disrupt effective coordination with the metal catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **complex peptide-like structures** or **multiple amide bonds** tend to result in **low yield** due to competing interactions.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules that resemble peptides, containing **multiple amide linkages** and potentially **multiple functional groups**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Complex structures may lead to **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** or **conformational constraints** that reduce the availability of coordination sites. Multiple functional groups might compete for metal binding, disrupting effective catalyst-modifier interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

These rules have been developed by closely analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines multiple substructures (functional groups) and considers their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in defining modifiers as **α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains**, and effectively predicts **high yield** when this structural feature is present. The physical-chemical insight about **multidentate coordination** enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity is adequate and relevant. The rule considers a combination of substructures (amino group, backbone, and additional carboxylate side chain), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two data points—**aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**—demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly identifies modifiers as **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position**, predicting **high yield**. The physical-chemical explanation linking electron-withdrawing effects to increased acidity and stronger metal-ligand coordination is sound. The rule combines multiple substructures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, para electron-withdrawing substituent), meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points, including **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, indicating strong coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in defining modifiers as **aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly connected to the ring**, associating them with **high yield**. The physical-chemical insight about nitrogen atoms providing additional coordination sites and stabilizing the metal-ligand complex is appropriate. The rule considers complex substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by data points such as **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 provides a clear distinction between **aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups**, predicting **high yield** for the former and **low yield** for the latter. The physical-chemical reasoning about steric hindrance and catalyst poisoning is adequate. The rule combines multiple substructures and is supported by data points like **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (high yield) and **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 describes modifiers as **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** leading to **high yield**, with a clear physical-chemical explanation. However, the rule is only supported by one data point—**octanoic acid**—which does not meet the minimum coverage requirement of two data points. This limits the confidence in the rule's generality.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional polar functional groups** result in **low yield**. The physical-chemical insight regarding steric hindrance and unfavorable interactions is appropriate. The rule considers combinations of chain length and functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points such as **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, demonstrating strong coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear about modifiers containing **aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid** leading to **low yield**. The explanation about potential side reactions and chelate formation is adequate. The rule focuses on specific substructures and is supported by at least three data points—**4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**—providing good coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 effectively differentiates between **α-amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains** (resulting in **high yield**) and those without nitrogen (resulting in **low yield**). The physical-chemical insight about additional coordination sites provided by nitrogen is sound. The rule combines multiple substructures and is supported by data points for **tryptophan** (high yield) and **phenylalanine** (low yield), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 specifies that **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents** tend to result in **low yield**, with an appropriate physical-chemical explanation. The rule considers combinations of substructures, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points like **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** and **4-methylbenzoic acid** (both low yield). However, there is a notable exception with **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** showing **high yield**, indicating the rule may have limitations and might require refinement.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly identifies that modifiers containing **polyether chains or multiple ether linkages** lead to **low yield**, providing adequate physical-chemical reasoning about interference with metal coordination. The rule involves complex substructures and is supported by at least two data points—**2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**—demonstrating sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that **N-acetylated amino acids or modifiers with blocked amino groups** result in **low yield**, with sound physical-chemical insight about reduced coordination sites. The rule considers complex substructures (amide bonds), fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points such as **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, indicating good coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 describes that **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** tend to result in **low yield**, providing relevant physical-chemical reasoning. However, the rule is only supported by a single data point—**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**—which does not meet the minimum coverage requirement, limiting its reliability.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 suggests that modifiers with **complex peptide-like structures or multiple amide bonds** lead to **low yield** due to competing interactions. While the physical-chemical explanation is reasonable, the rule lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one data point—**2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**—which overlaps with Rule 11. This insufficient coverage reduces confidence in the rule's general applicability.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids containing an additional **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** in the side chain, providing multiple coordination sites to the metal center.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both the amino group and two carboxylate groups allows for **multidentate coordination**, forming stable chelate complexes with the metal catalyst. This enhances the catalyst's stability and reactivity, promoting higher yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)** groups, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings bearing a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **electron-withdrawing group** at the para position, which **increases the acidity** of the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing substituents enhance the carboxylic acid's ability to donate electrons to the metal center, strengthening metal-ligand coordination. This improved interaction increases the catalyst's efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly connected to the ring**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole derivatives**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules where the **nitrogen-containing heterocycle** is either part of the aromatic ring or directly attached to it, alongside a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms act as **additional coordination sites**, facilitating stronger binding to the metal center. The aromatic system can delocalize charge, stabilizing the metal-ligand complex and enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups (-SH) on short chains** tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Short-chain aliphatic acids with a **thiol group (-SH)**, providing an additional coordination point without significant steric hindrance.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic acids with **thiol groups** attached directly to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: In aliphatic acids, the thiol group can coordinate effectively with the metal without causing deactivation.
    - **Low Yield**: In aromatic acids, thiol groups may bind too strongly to the metal center, potentially **poisoning the catalyst** by blocking active sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
    - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups**, such as **octanoic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: **Straight-chain aliphatic acids** with a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and no other functional groups along the chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The lack of additional polar groups minimizes steric hindrance and undesired interactions, allowing the carboxyl group to coordinate effectively with the metal center. The hydrophobic chain may also aid in catalyst solubility in organic solvents.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (7 carbons or more) with additional polar functional groups**, such as **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Long aliphatic chains bearing **polar functional groups** in addition to the **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of polar groups on long chains can cause **steric hindrance** and unfavorable **intramolecular interactions**, hindering the coordination between the carboxyl group and the metal center. It may also affect solubility and catalyst distribution.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that contain **aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids with **carbonyl groups** (aldehyde or ketone) near the **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group can participate in **side reactions** or form **stable chelate rings** with the metal center that alter the catalyst's activity, thereby decreasing the yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains containing nitrogen**, such as **tryptophan**, tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those with **aromatic side chains lacking nitrogen**, such as **phenylalanine**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids with **nitrogenous aromatic side chains** (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with **non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains** (e.g., benzene ring in phenylalanine).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen in the side chain can provide an extra **coordination site**, enhancing metal binding.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of additional coordination sites results in less effective metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents**, such as **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **methoxy (-OCH₃)** groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and **electron-donating groups** that decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-donating substituents reduce the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with the metal center, weakening the metal-ligand interaction and decreasing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains** or **multiple ether linkages** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids with **ether bonds (-O-)** in their structure, creating **flexible polyether chains**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The ether oxygen atoms may interfere with the coordination between the carboxyl group and the metal center. The increased flexibility and solvation can reduce effective interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids** or have **blocked amino groups** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group is acylated or modified**, such as forming an **amide bond**, reducing the number of available coordination sites.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Blocking the amino group prevents it from coordinating with the metal center, diminishing chelation and weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids**, especially those with multiple **fluorine atoms**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a high degree of **fluorination** along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect increases the acidity of the carboxylic acid but can also enhance hydrophobicity and decrease solubility in the reaction medium. The altered electronic properties may disrupt effective coordination with the metal catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **complex peptide-like structures** or **multiple amide bonds** tend to result in **low yield** due to competing interactions.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules that resemble peptides, containing **multiple amide linkages** and potentially **multiple functional groups**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Complex structures may lead to **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** or **conformational constraints** that reduce the availability of coordination sites. Multiple functional groups might compete for metal binding, disrupting effective catalyst-modifier interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by closely analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines multiple substructures (functional groups) and considers their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.

Matrix Checker Message:
After carefully examining the transformation from the language rules to the numeric feature matrix, I have identified several discrepancies between the rules as described and their implementation in the code. Below are specific suggestions to improve the current code to more accurately reflect the rules.

---

**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Modify Rule 5 and Rule 6 to Correctly Distinguish between High and Low Yield Modifiers**

  - **Issue**: **Octanoic acid** (SMILES index 6) should match **Rule 5** (high yield) but incorrectly matches **Rule 6** (low yield) in the feature matrix. This suggests that the code is not properly distinguishing between long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with and without additional polar functional groups.

  - **Solution**:
    - **Adjust Rule 5 Patterns**: Modify the patterns to ensure that **Rule 5** matches long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids **without** additional polar groups.
      ```python
      # Original pattern
      '[C][C][C][C][C][C][C][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
      # Improved pattern to match chains of 7 or more carbons
      '[C][C][C][C][C][C][C,$(C[C,C][CX3](=O)[OX2H1])]'
      ```
    - **Ensure Exclude Patterns Are Applied Correctly**: Make sure that the exclude patterns in **Rule 5** are correctly implemented to prevent matching molecules with additional polar groups.
      ```python
      'exclude_patterns': [
          '[#6][OX2H]',  # Hydroxyl groups
          '[#6][NX3]',   # Amino groups
          '[#6][SX2H]',  # Thiol groups
      ],
      ```
    - **Modify Rule 6 Patterns**: Ensure that **Rule 6** only matches when both the long-chain carboxylic acid and additional polar functional groups are present.
      ```python
      # Require the presence of both patterns in Rule 6
      'patterns': [
          '[C][C][C][C][C][C][C][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Long-chain acid
          '[#6][OX2H,$(NX3H2)]',  # Additional hydroxyl or amino groups
      ],
      ```
    - **Implementation Check**: After modifications, confirm that **octanoic acid** matches **Rule 5** with a prediction of **1** and does not match **Rule 6**.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Expand Rule 9 to Include All Electron-Donating Groups on Aromatic Rings**

  - **Issue**: Compounds like **4-aminobenzoic acid** (SMILES index 5) have amino groups that are strong electron-donating substituents but are not captured by **Rule 9** in the current code. This rule currently only includes hydroxyl and methoxy groups.

  - **Solution**:
    - **Add Amino Group to Rule 9 Patterns**: Include amino groups in the SMARTS pattern for **Rule 9** to detect electron-donating substituents on aromatic rings.
      ```python
      'patterns': [
          '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Aromatic carboxylic acid
          '[$([c][OX2H]),$([c][OX2][CH3]),$([c][NX3H2])]',  # Include amino groups
      ],
      ```
    - **Update Code Comments**: Reflect the change in code comments to indicate that amino groups are now considered.
    - **Implementation Check**: Ensure that **4-aminobenzoic acid** now matches **Rule 9** with a prediction of **-1**.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine Rule 4 Patterns to Accurately Differentiate Between Aliphatic and Aromatic Thiols**

  - **Issue**: Compounds like **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (SMILES index 18) should match **Rule 4.1** (high yield with aliphatic thiols), but currently, the feature matrix does not reflect this.

  - **Solution**:
    - **Modify Rule 4.1 Patterns**: Ensure that **Rule 4.1** specifically matches aliphatic thiols.
      ```python
      'patterns': [
          '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Carboxylic acid
          '[CX4][CX4][SX2H]',  # Thiol group on short aliphatic chain (e.g., two carbons)
      ],
      ```
    - **Modify Rule 4.2 Patterns**: Ensure that **Rule 4.2** specifically matches aromatic thiols.
      ```python
      'patterns': [
          '[c][SX2H]',           # Thiol attached to aromatic ring
          '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', # Aromatic carboxylic acid
      ],
      ```
    - **Implementation Check**: Confirm that **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** matches **Rule 4.1** with a prediction of **1**.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Enhance Rule 7 to Capture All Modifiers with Adjacent Carbonyl Groups**

  - **Issue**: Compounds like **4-oxopentanoic acid** might not be accurately matched by **Rule 7** due to the specific SMARTS pattern used.

  - **Solution**:
    - **Adjust Rule 7 Pattern**: Generalize the pattern to detect any aldehyde or ketone group adjacent to the carboxylic acid.
      ```python
      'patterns': [
          '[CX3](=O)[CX3;$([CX3](=O)[#6])][#6][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Ketone adjacent to carboxylic acid
          '[#6][CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Aldehyde adjacent to carboxylic acid
      ],
      ```
    - **Implementation Check**: Ensure that compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups to the carboxylic acid are correctly matched with a prediction of **-1**.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Broaden Rule 13 to Include Complex Peptide-like Structures**

  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern for **Rule 13** may not capture all modifiers with complex peptide-like structures or multiple amide bonds.

  - **Solution**:
    - **Expand Rule 13 Pattern**: Use recursive SMARTS or more generalized patterns to detect multiple amide bonds.
      ```python
      'patterns': [
          '[CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3](=O)[NX3]',              # Two consecutive amide bonds
          '[NX3][CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3](=O)[NX3]',         # Three consecutive amide bonds
          '[CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3](=O)[NX3]', # Multiple amide bonds
      ],
      ```
    - **Implementation Check**: Verify that complex peptides and molecules like **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (SMILES index 24 and 28) are correctly matched with a prediction of **-1**.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Include Side Chain Length and Composition in Rule 8**

  - **Issue**: **Phenylalanine** (SMILES index 13) should match **Rule 8.2** (low yield), but the current code may not capture all non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains.

  - **Solution**:
    - **Refine Rule 8.2 Patterns**: Ensure that the pattern captures alpha-amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking nitrogen.
      ```python
      'patterns': [
          '[NX3][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',         # Alpha-amino acid core
          '[CX4][c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1',           # Phenylalanine side chain
      ],
      'exclude_patterns': [
          '[#6][#6][n][c]',                      # Exclude nitrogenous aromatics
          '[#6][#6][nH][c]',                     # Exclude protonated nitrogenous aromatics
      ],
      ```
    - **Implementation Check**: Verify that **phenylalanine** matches **Rule 8.2** with a prediction of **-1**.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Adjust Rule 2 to Recognize All Electron-Withdrawing Groups**

  - **Issue**: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (SMILES index 21) should match **Rule 2** (high yield), but may not be captured if the code's pattern is too narrow.

  - **Solution**:
    - **Expand Rule 2 Patterns**: Include a broader range of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position.
      ```python
      'patterns': [
          '[c]:[c]:[c]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1]):[c]([$([NX3](=O)[OX1-]),$([CX3](=O)[OX1-]),$([SX4](=O)(=O)[O-]),$([F,Cl,Br,I])]):[c]:[c]',  # Aromatic ring with para EWG
      ],
      ```
    - **Implementation Check**: Confirm that **4-nitrobenzoic acid** matches **Rule 2** with a prediction of **1**.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Improve Exclude Patterns to Prevent False Positives**

  - **Issue**: Some rules may incorrectly match compounds due to insufficient exclude patterns.

  - **Solution**:
    - **Review All Rules for Proper Exclude Patterns**: For each rule, ensure that exclude patterns are comprehensive to avoid false positives.
    - **Example for Rule 1**: Exclude compounds that are not alpha-amino acids despite having multiple carboxylic acids.
      ```python
      'exclude_patterns': [
          '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Non-amino dicarboxylic acids
      ],
      ```
    - **Implementation Check**: Test the rules with a variety of compounds to verify accurate matching.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Utilize RDKit's Built-in Functionality for Stereochemistry**

  - **Issue**: Some SMILES strings contain stereochemistry that may affect pattern matching.

  - **Solution**:
    - **Include Stereochemistry in Patterns**: Use RDKit's stereochemistry-aware matching to ensure accurate identification.
      ```python
      # For stereocenters in amino acids
      '[NX3][C@H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
      ```
    - **Implementation Check**: Ensure that amino acids with specific stereochemistry are correctly matched.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Add Additional Error Handling for Unparsable Molecules**

  - **Issue**: The current code assigns zero vectors to molecules that cannot be parsed, which may mask data issues.

  - **Solution**:
    - **Implement Error Logging**: Log SMILES strings that cannot be parsed for further inspection.
      ```python
      if mol is None:
          logging.warning(f"Cannot parse SMILES: {smi}")
          results.append([0]*len(rules))
          continue
      ```
    - **Data Cleaning**: Review and correct any incorrect SMILES strings in the dataset.

**End of Suggestions**

---

By implementing these suggestions, the code should more accurately reflect the language rules and improve the effectiveness of the transformation into the numeric feature matrix.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids containing an additional **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** in the side chain, providing multiple coordination sites to the metal center.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both the amino group and two carboxylate groups allows for **multidentate coordination**, forming stable chelate complexes with the metal catalyst. This enhances the catalyst's stability and reactivity, promoting higher yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)** groups, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings bearing a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **electron-withdrawing group** at the para position, which **increases the acidity** of the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing substituents enhance the carboxylic acid's ability to donate electrons to the metal center, strengthening metal-ligand coordination. This improved interaction increases the catalyst's efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly connected to the ring**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole derivatives**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules where the **nitrogen-containing heterocycle** is either part of the aromatic ring or directly attached to it, alongside a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms act as **additional coordination sites**, facilitating stronger binding to the metal center. The aromatic system can delocalize charge, stabilizing the metal-ligand complex and enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups (-SH) on short chains** tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Short-chain aliphatic acids with a **thiol group (-SH)**, providing an additional coordination point without significant steric hindrance.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic acids with **thiol groups** attached directly to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: In aliphatic acids, the thiol group can coordinate effectively with the metal without causing deactivation.
    - **Low Yield**: In aromatic acids, thiol groups may bind too strongly to the metal center, potentially **poisoning the catalyst** by blocking active sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
    - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups**, such as **octanoic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: **Straight-chain aliphatic acids** with a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and no other functional groups along the chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The lack of additional polar groups minimizes steric hindrance and undesired interactions, allowing the carboxyl group to coordinate effectively with the metal center. The hydrophobic chain may also aid in catalyst solubility in organic solvents.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (7 carbons or more) with additional polar functional groups**, such as **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Long aliphatic chains bearing **polar functional groups** in addition to the **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of polar groups on long chains can cause **steric hindrance** and unfavorable **intramolecular interactions**, hindering the coordination between the carboxyl group and the metal center. It may also affect solubility and catalyst distribution.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that contain **aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids with **carbonyl groups** (aldehyde or ketone) near the **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group can participate in **side reactions** or form **stable chelate rings** with the metal center that alter the catalyst's activity, thereby decreasing the yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains containing nitrogen**, such as **tryptophan**, tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those with **aromatic side chains lacking nitrogen**, such as **phenylalanine**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids with **nitrogenous aromatic side chains** (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with **non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains** (e.g., benzene ring in phenylalanine).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen in the side chain can provide an extra **coordination site**, enhancing metal binding.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of additional coordination sites results in less effective metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents**, such as **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **methoxy (-OCH₃)** groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and **electron-donating groups** that decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-donating substituents reduce the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with the metal center, weakening the metal-ligand interaction and decreasing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains** or **multiple ether linkages** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids with **ether bonds (-O-)** in their structure, creating **flexible polyether chains**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The ether oxygen atoms may interfere with the coordination between the carboxyl group and the metal center. The increased flexibility and solvation can reduce effective interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids** or have **blocked amino groups** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group is acylated or modified**, such as forming an **amide bond**, reducing the number of available coordination sites.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Blocking the amino group prevents it from coordinating with the metal center, diminishing chelation and weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids**, especially those with multiple **fluorine atoms**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a high degree of **fluorination** along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect increases the acidity of the carboxylic acid but can also enhance hydrophobicity and decrease solubility in the reaction medium. The altered electronic properties may disrupt effective coordination with the metal catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **complex peptide-like structures** or **multiple amide bonds** tend to result in **low yield** due to competing interactions.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules that resemble peptides, containing **multiple amide linkages** and potentially **multiple functional groups**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Complex structures may lead to **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** or **conformational constraints** that reduce the availability of coordination sites. Multiple functional groups might compete for metal binding, disrupting effective catalyst-modifier interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by closely analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines multiple substructures (functional groups) and considers their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Modify the Matching Logic in the Code**  
  The current code requires all SMARTS patterns within a rule to match simultaneously (logical AND), which may be too restrictive for many rules where patterns are meant to represent alternative options (logical OR). Update the code so that for each rule:
    - If the rule requires *any* of the patterns to match (logical OR), the code should consider the rule matched if **at least one** pattern matches.
    - If the rule requires *all* patterns to match simultaneously (logical AND), the code should consider the rule matched only if **all** patterns match.
  Implement this by adding a `match_type` key to each rule (e.g., `'match_type': 'any'` or `'match_type': 'all'`) and adjust the matching logic accordingly.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Combine Patterns Appropriately Based on Logical Requirements**  
  For rules where multiple structural features must be present simultaneously (logical AND), combine the patterns into a **single SMARTS pattern** that captures the required combination. This ensures that the code checks for the presence of all necessary features in one substructure match.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Review and Correct SMARTS Patterns for Accuracy**  
  Carefully revisit the SMARTS patterns for each rule to ensure they accurately represent the chemical features described in the natural language rules. Some patterns may be too generic or misrepresent the intended structures. For example:
    - **Rule 1**: Create a single SMARTS pattern that matches α-amino acids with a carboxylate side chain, such as `[N;X3;H2][C@@H]([C;X4](=O)[O;X2H1])[C;X4](=O)[O;X2H1]`, to accurately capture molecules like aspartic acid and glutamic acid.
    - **Rule 2**: Adjust patterns to specifically identify aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. For example, use a pattern like `c1ccc(cc1C(=O)[O;H1])[*:R]`, where `[*:R]` represents the electron-withdrawing group at the para position, and define separate SMARTS for nitro and bromomethyl groups.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Implement Logical Operators in Patterns Where Necessary**  
  Utilize recursive SMARTS or logical operators within SMARTS patterns to express complex structural requirements. This can make patterns more accurate and reduce the need for multiple separate patterns. For example, in **Rule 2**, use `c1cc([NX3+](=O)[O-])ccc1C(=O)[O;H1]` for nitrobenzoic acid or `c1cc(CBr)ccc1C(=O)[O;H1]` for bromomethylbenzoic acid.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Enhance Exclude Pattern Handling**  
  Ensure that `exclude_patterns` are correctly implemented. The code should skip the rule matching for a molecule if **any** of the exclude patterns match. This requires no change if the current logic is accurately handling this, but verify to be certain.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Test and Validate Each Rule Individually**  
  After updating the patterns and logic, test each rule against known molecules that should match (positive controls) and should not match (negative controls). For example:
    - Test **Rule 1** with aspartic acid and glutamic acid to ensure they return a prediction of `1`.
    - Test **Rule 2** with 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid to ensure they return a prediction of `1`.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Add Comments and Documentation in Code**  
  Clearly comment the code to explain the purpose of each pattern and any logical conditions applied. This will make it easier for collaborators to understand and modify the code in the future.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Consider Using SMARTS Libraries or Tools for Complex Patterns**  
  For complex pattern matching, consider leveraging cheminformatics libraries that offer enhanced SMARTS handling, such as RDKit's `RecSMARTS` for recursive searches, which can simplify the expression of complex structural requirements.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids containing an additional **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** in the side chain, providing multiple coordination sites to the metal center.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of both the amino group and two carboxylate groups allows for **multidentate coordination**, forming stable chelate complexes with the metal catalyst. This enhances the catalyst's stability and reactivity, promoting higher yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)** groups, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings bearing a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **electron-withdrawing group** at the para position, which **increases the acidity** of the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing substituents enhance the carboxylic acid's ability to donate electrons to the metal center, strengthening metal-ligand coordination. This improved interaction increases the catalyst's efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly connected to the ring**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole derivatives**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules where the **nitrogen-containing heterocycle** is either part of the aromatic ring or directly attached to it, alongside a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms act as **additional coordination sites**, facilitating stronger binding to the metal center. The aromatic system can delocalize charge, stabilizing the metal-ligand complex and enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups (-SH) on short chains** tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Short-chain aliphatic acids with a **thiol group (-SH)**, providing an additional coordination point without significant steric hindrance.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic acids with **thiol groups** attached directly to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: In aliphatic acids, the thiol group can coordinate effectively with the metal without causing deactivation.
    - **Low Yield**: In aromatic acids, thiol groups may bind too strongly to the metal center, potentially **poisoning the catalyst** by blocking active sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
    - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups**, such as **octanoic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: **Straight-chain aliphatic acids** with a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and no other functional groups along the chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The lack of additional polar groups minimizes steric hindrance and undesired interactions, allowing the carboxyl group to coordinate effectively with the metal center. The hydrophobic chain may also aid in catalyst solubility in organic solvents.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (7 carbons or more) with additional polar functional groups**, such as **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Long aliphatic chains bearing **polar functional groups** in addition to the **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of polar groups on long chains can cause **steric hindrance** and unfavorable **intramolecular interactions**, hindering the coordination between the carboxyl group and the metal center. It may also affect solubility and catalyst distribution.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that contain **aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids with **carbonyl groups** (aldehyde or ketone) near the **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group can participate in **side reactions** or form **stable chelate rings** with the metal center that alter the catalyst's activity, thereby decreasing the yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains containing nitrogen**, such as **tryptophan**, tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those with **aromatic side chains lacking nitrogen**, such as **phenylalanine**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids with **nitrogenous aromatic side chains** (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with **non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains** (e.g., benzene ring in phenylalanine).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen in the side chain can provide an extra **coordination site**, enhancing metal binding.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of additional coordination sites results in less effective metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents**, such as **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **methoxy (-OCH₃)** groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and **electron-donating groups** that decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-donating substituents reduce the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with the metal center, weakening the metal-ligand interaction and decreasing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains** or **multiple ether linkages** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids with **ether bonds (-O-)** in their structure, creating **flexible polyether chains**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The ether oxygen atoms may interfere with the coordination between the carboxyl group and the metal center. The increased flexibility and solvation can reduce effective interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids** or have **blocked amino groups** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group is acylated or modified**, such as forming an **amide bond**, reducing the number of available coordination sites.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Blocking the amino group prevents it from coordinating with the metal center, diminishing chelation and weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids**, especially those with multiple **fluorine atoms**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a high degree of **fluorination** along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effect increases the acidity of the carboxylic acid but can also enhance hydrophobicity and decrease solubility in the reaction medium. The altered electronic properties may disrupt effective coordination with the metal catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **complex peptide-like structures** or **multiple amide bonds** tend to result in **low yield** due to competing interactions.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules that resemble peptides, containing **multiple amide linkages** and potentially **multiple functional groups**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Complex structures may lead to **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** or **conformational constraints** that reduce the availability of coordination sites. Multiple functional groups might compete for metal binding, disrupting effective catalyst-modifier interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by closely analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines multiple substructures (functional groups) and considers their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Generalize SMARTS Patterns**: Modify the SMARTS patterns in the code to be more general and accurately represent the natural language rules. Currently, many patterns are too specific and only match the examples provided. For instance, in **Rule 1**, the SMARTS pattern should be updated to match any **α-amino acid with carboxylate side chains**, not just aspartic acid or glutamic acid. Consider using patterns that capture the essential features of α-amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups of varying lengths.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Use Variable Length Side Chains**: For rules involving aliphatic chains of certain lengths (e.g., **Rule 5** and **Rule 6**), use SMARTS quantifiers to specify chain lengths. For example, `[C;X4]{7,}` matches chains of seven or more carbons. Ensure that additional functional groups are accurately included or excluded by refining these patterns.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Incorporate Electron-Withdrawing/Donating Groups**: In **Rule 2** and **Rule 9**, instead of specifying exact substituents like nitro or methoxy groups, use SMARTS to represent general electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups. For example, use `[c][c]([C;X4]=[O])[c][c][c]C(=O)[O;H1]` with appropriate wildcard atoms or recursive SMARTS to match various substituents at the para position.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Enhance Patterns with Logical Operators**: Utilize advanced SMARTS features like logical operators, recursion, and atom properties to capture complex rules. For **Rule 3**, create patterns that match any nitrogen-containing heterocycle attached to an aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid group, rather than specific heterocycles.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Address Missing Matches in the Feature Matrix**: Review the SMILES strings that should match certain rules but currently don't (e.g., glutamic acid and aspartic acid for **Rule 1**). Ensure that the SMARTS patterns are corrected so that these compounds are matched appropriately, resulting in accurate feature matrix values.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Update Exclusion Criteria**: For rules like **Rule 5** and **Rule 6**, refine the exclusion patterns to prevent unintended matches. Ensure that molecules with additional polar functional groups are correctly excluded or included based on the rule by carefully crafting the SMARTS patterns.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Test SMARTS Patterns Individually**: Before integrating the patterns into the code, test each SMARTS pattern against a set of representative SMILES strings to confirm that they match the intended structures and do not match structures they shouldn't.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Use Descriptive Variable Names**: In the code, use variable names that reflect the function or purpose of the SMARTS patterns (e.g., `alpha_amino_acid_pattern`) to improve readability and maintainability.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Consult Cheminformatics Resources**: Utilize cheminformatics tools or consult with experts to help construct accurate and general SMARTS patterns. Tools like RDKit's SMARTSviewer or online resources can assist in visualizing and testing patterns.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Improve Rule Matching Logic**: Modify the code to better handle the logical requirements of each rule. For example, if a rule requires both a specific substructure and the absence of another, ensure that the code checks for all necessary conditions, possibly using logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of the Current Rule Metrics Compared to Reference Metrics**

In evaluating the performance of the current set of rules, we'll focus on two key metrics: **confidence** and **lift**, as requested. We'll compare the current metrics to the previous metrics provided to assess improvements or declines in performance.

---

**1. Confidence**

- **Previous Train Confidence**: 
  - Mean of [0.6352, 0.5396] ≈ **0.5874**
- **Current Train Confidence**: **0.6067**

*Analysis:*

The **current train confidence** of **0.6067** is higher than the **previous average train confidence** of **0.5874**. This indicates that the current rules are slightly more reliable in predicting **high yields** when their conditions are met. A higher confidence means that when the antecedent (rule condition) is true, there's a greater probability that the consequent (rule prediction) is also true.

---

**2. Lift**

- **Previous Train Lift**: 
  - Mean of [1.2048, 1.0559] ≈ **1.1304**
- **Current Train Lift**: **1.2076**

*Analysis:*

The **current train lift** of **1.2076** is higher than the **previous average train lift** of **1.1304**. Lift measures how much better a rule is at predicting the outcome compared to random chance. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is effective. The increase in lift suggests that the current rules have a stronger association between the conditions and the prediction of high yield, making them more interesting and valuable.

---

**3. Support**

- **Previous Train Support**: 
  - Mean of [0.1667, 0.1845] ≈ **0.1756**
- **Current Train Support**: **0.0229**

*Analysis:*

While not the primary focus, it's important to note that the **current train support** has decreased significantly compared to the previous average. This means that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. Low support can indicate that the rules are too specific and may not generalize well.

---

**4. Leverage**

- **Previous Train Leverage**: 
  - Mean of [0.0289, -0.0041] ≈ **0.0124**
- **Current Train Leverage**: **0.0073**

*Analysis:*

The **current leverage** is positive but slightly lower than the previous average. Positive leverage indicates that the rule has a stronger association than expected by chance. However, the decrease suggests that the additional support the rule receives over random chance has diminished.

---

**Determining If a Local Minimum Has Been Reached**

Based on the metrics:

- **Improved Confidence and Lift**: The increases in both confidence and lift indicate that the current rules have become better at predicting high yields when their conditions are met.

- **Decreased Support**: The significant drop in support suggests the rules now cover fewer instances in the dataset.

This trade-off is common in rule optimization:

- **High Confidence and Lift with Low Support**: Indicates specialized rules that are highly accurate but apply to few cases.

- **Balancing Generality and Precision**: There's a balance between creating general rules that cover more data (higher support) and specific rules that are more accurate (higher confidence and lift).

Given that confidence and lift have improved but support has decreased, it suggests that we may have reached a **local minimum** where further iterations may not yield significant improvements without overfitting.

---

**Have There Been Enough Iterations?**

- **Potential Overfitting**: The drop in support could mean the rules are becoming too tailored to the training data, which may not generalize well to new data.

- **Marginal Gains**: If recent iterations only yield marginal improvements in confidence and lift, it may indicate diminishing returns.

Therefore, it may be appropriate to consider halting further iterations focused solely on increasing confidence and lift, and instead, focus on improving rule generality.

---

**Suggestions for Improving the Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the rules while maintaining or improving the current confidence and lift values, consider the following:

1. **Increase Rule Generality to Improve Support**

   - **Simplify Rule Conditions**: Identify overly specific conditions that can be generalized without significantly reducing confidence.
   - **Merge Similar Rules**: Combine rules that have overlapping conditions or predictions to cover more instances.

2. **Re-evaluate Rule Complexity**

   - **Avoid Overfitting**: Ensure that rules are not too complex, capturing noise rather than meaningful patterns.
   - **Prune Redundant Conditions**: Remove conditions that do not contribute significantly to confidence or lift.

3. **Incorporate Additional Data**

   - **Expand Dataset**: If possible, include more data to allow for the development of rules with higher support.
   - **Cross-validation**: Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure that rules generalize well to unseen data.

4. **Balance Confidence, Lift, and Support**

   - **Adjust Thresholds**: Consider relaxing thresholds for support to include rules that cover more data, even if it slightly lowers confidence and lift.
   - **Weighted Metrics**: Use a combined metric that considers confidence, lift, and support to evaluate rule performance holistically.

5. **Analyze Exceptions and Outliers**

   - **Study Low Yield Cases**: Investigate instances where high-yield predictions were incorrect to identify patterns or missing conditions.
   - **Refine Definitions**: Ensure that definitions of 'high yield' and 'low yield' are appropriate and consider redefining thresholds if necessary.

6. **Incorporate Domain Knowledge**

   - **Consult Chemistry Experts**: Use expert insights to validate rules and suggest modifications based on chemical intuition.
   - **Consider Additional Chemical Properties**: Include other relevant physical-chemical properties that may influence yield.

7. **Iterative Testing**

   - **Test on Validation Set**: Apply the rules to a validation set to assess their predictive power on unseen data.
   - **Monitor Overfitting Indicators**: Keep an eye on discrepancies between training and validation performance.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules shows improved confidence and lift, indicating stronger predictive capability for the instances they cover. However, the decrease in support suggests that these rules are applicable to a smaller portion of the data, potentially limiting their practical utility.

To enhance the overall performance:

- **Aim for a Balance**: Strive to find rules that maintain high confidence and lift while also increasing support.

- **Review and Refine Rules**: Simplify overly complex rules and consider generalizing conditions to cover more instances without significantly compromising accuracy.

- **Continue Iterations with Focused Objectives**: Future iterations should aim to improve support and ensure that the rules generalize well to new data, avoiding overfitting.

By implementing these improvements, the rules can become more robust, covering a larger portion of the data while maintaining strong predictive performance.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

1. **Evaluation of Effectiveness:**

   The current rules appear to be less effective compared to previous iterations. The validation accuracies from previous iterations were consistently around **0.76**, with test accuracies of **0.75** or **0.625**. In contrast, the current iteration shows a validation accuracy of **0.514**, which is a significant decrease.

2. **Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   The substantial drop in accuracy suggests that the model may be **underfitting** the data. The current rules might not be capturing the underlying patterns effectively, leading to poor generalization on the validation set. Alternatively, there might be overfitting to certain features that are not representative of the broader dataset.

3. **Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values:**

   **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecules with Overestimated Loadings:**
     - **C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
     - **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O**
     - **C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN**
     - **COCCOCCOCC(=O)O**
     - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=NC=C2)C(=O)O**
     - **C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O**
     - **C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F**
     - **C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O**
     - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O**
     - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)S**

   - **Rule with High Positive SHAP Value:**
     - **Rule 13** consistently has high positive SHAP values for these molecules, contributing significantly to the incorrect prediction of high loading.

   **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - **Molecules with Underestimated Loadings:**
     - **C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O**

   - **Rule with High Negative SHAP Value:**
     - **Rule 13** does not contribute significantly to underestimated loadings in this case, but the overall low SHAP value suggests it may not be effectively capturing the features associated with high loading for this molecule.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics:**

   The decrease in validation accuracy from previous iterations indicates that the probability of improvement with the current rules is low. The inconsistencies between predicted and experimental values suggest that the model is not generalizing well and that certain rules may be misrepresenting the influence of molecular features on catalyst loading.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Rule 13** emerges as a key contributor to misclassifications. The high positive SHAP values associated with overestimated loadings imply that **Rule 13** is influencing the model to predict high loading when the experimental value is low.
   - Since **Rule 13** is intended to predict **low yield** for modifiers with complex peptide-like structures or multiple amide bonds, the positive SHAP values indicate a possible misimplementation or misinterpretation in the feature matrix.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refinement of Rule 13:**

   - **Clarify the Definition:**
     - Re-evaluate the chemical features defined in **Rule 13** to ensure they accurately represent modifiers that lead to low yield. Consider specifying the types of peptide-like structures or amide bonds that are most impactful.
   - **Adjust the Implementation:**
     - Ensure that **Rule 13** is correctly encoded in the feature matrix, such that it contributes negatively (i.e., predicts low loading) when modifiers have complex peptide-like structures or multiple amide bonds.
   - **Increase Specificity:**
     - Incorporate additional criteria to distinguish between modifiers that genuinely lead to low yields and those that do not. This may involve setting thresholds for the number of amide bonds or considering the presence of competing functional groups.

2. **Review Other Rules with High SHAP Contributions:**

   - Analyze other rules that may be contributing to misclassifications, even if they are not identified in the current SHAP analysis. Rules with ambiguous definitions or broad criteria might be causing unintended effects.

3. **Enhance Generalization:**

   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules:**
     - Simplify rules that may be too complex or specific, which can lead to overfitting. Focus on the most critical chemical features that influence catalyst loading.
   - **Expand Dataset Coverage:**
     - Ensure that the rules cover a diverse range of molecules in the dataset to improve generalization and prevent underfitting.

4. **Iterative Refinement with SHAP Insights:**

   - Use the SHAP analysis as a feedback mechanism to iteratively refine the rules:
     - **Identify Patterns:**
       - Look for patterns in the SHAP values across different molecules to pinpoint which chemical features are being misrepresented.
     - **Adjust Rule Weightings:**
       - Modify the weight or influence of certain rules based on their contribution to misclassifications.
     - **Validate Changes:**
       - After refining the rules, retrain the model and assess whether there is an improvement in validation accuracy.

5. **Consider Additional Features:**

   - Incorporate new chemical features that may influence catalyst loading, such as:
     - **Steric Hindrance Factors:**
       - Evaluate the impact of bulky groups near coordination sites.
     - **Electronic Effects:**
       - Consider the overall electron density and its effect on metal coordination.
     - **Solubility and Hydrophobicity:**
       - Include descriptors related to the modifier's solubility in the reaction medium.

6. **Assess Rule Interactions:**

   - Investigate possible interactions between rules that may be causing conflicting predictions. Ensure that the combination of rules leads to coherent and accurate predictions.

7. **Enhance Model Complexity if Necessary:**

   - If underfitting is suspected due to model simplicity, consider using a more complex model or adding non-linear interactions between features.

**Conclusion**

The current rules, particularly **Rule 13**, are not effectively capturing the relationship between molecular features and catalyst loading, leading to decreased model performance. By refining **Rule 13** and potentially other rules based on the SHAP analysis, we can improve the model's predictive accuracy. Iterative refinement and careful consideration of the chemical features will enhance the model's ability to generalize and provide more reliable predictions.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing the Current Rules**

The recent evaluation of the current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction indicates that there are issues impacting their effectiveness. Key observations include:

1. **Decrease in Validation Accuracy**: The validation accuracy has dropped from approximately 76% in previous iterations to around 51% in the current iteration. This suggests that the model's performance has deteriorated and is not generalizing well to unseen data.

2. **SHAP Analysis Reveals Misclassifications**: The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis highlights that certain rules, particularly **Rule 13**, are contributing significantly to incorrect predictions. In multiple cases, Rule 13 has high positive SHAP values where the experimental yield is low, indicating a misalignment between the rule's intent and its implementation.

3. **Potential Overfitting and Underfitting**: The combination of high confidence and lift but low support suggests that the rules have become too specific, covering fewer instances in the dataset. This can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on validation data. Conversely, the overall low accuracy hints at underfitting, where the model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns.

**Suggestions to Improve the Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the rules and address the identified issues, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns to Accurately Represent Chemical Features**:
   - **Generalize Patterns**: Modify the SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to be more general and capture broader chemical features. For example, in **Rule 1**, adjust the pattern to match any α-amino acid with carboxylate side chains, not just specific examples like aspartic acid or glutamic acid.
   - **Use Wildcards and Logical Operators**: Incorporate wildcards and logical operators in SMARTS patterns to represent classes of functional groups, such as any electron-withdrawing group in **Rule 2** or any electron-donating group in **Rule 9**.

2. **Ensure Correct Implementation of Rules in the Feature Matrix**:
   - **Test Patterns Individually**: Before applying the SMARTS patterns to the entire dataset, test them on known compounds to ensure they match the intended structures.
   - **Address Missing Matches**: Review cases where compounds that should match a rule are not being captured. For instance, ensure that glutamic acid and aspartic acid are correctly matched by **Rule 1**.

3. **Refine Rule Definitions to Improve Specificity and Generality**:

These rules have been developed by closely analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines multiple substructures (functional groups) and considers their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1: Refine SMARTS Patterns to Accurately Represent Chemical Features**

  - **Generalize SMARTS Patterns**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to be more inclusive and accurately represent the intended chemical features.

    - **For Rule 1 (α-Amino Acids with Carboxylate Side Chains)**:

      - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern may be too specific and not capturing all α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains.
      - **Solution**: Use wildcards and recursive patterns to match any α-amino acid with an additional carboxylate group in the side chain.
      - **Example SMARTS Pattern**: `N[C@@H](C)C(=O)O` and side chain containing `C(=O)[O-]`
      - **Revised Pattern**: `[N;H2][C@@H](C(=O)O)[CX4][CX3](=O)[O-]`

    - **For Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Para Substituents)**:

      - **Issue**: The pattern may not include all electron-withdrawing groups.
      - **Solution**: Use a generic pattern for electron-withdrawing groups at the para position.
      - **Example SMARTS Pattern**: `c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O` with a substituent at the para position `[cH]1[cH][cH][c]([$(N(=O)=O),Br,C#N)][cH][cH]1C(=O)O`

  - **Use Wildcards and Logical Operators**: Incorporate wildcards (`*`), logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`), and recursive SMARTS to broaden the patterns.

    - **Wildcard Example**: `[c][c][c][c][c][c]` can be used to represent a benzene ring.
    - **Logical Operators Example**: `[N;H2]` represents a primary amine, while `[!R]` excludes rings.

- **Advice 2: Ensure Correct Implementation of Rules in the Feature Matrix**

  - **Test Patterns Individually**:

    - **Action**: Apply each SMARTS pattern to a subset of compounds with known outcomes to verify correct matches.
    - **Example**: Verify that aspartic acid and glutamic acid are matched by the revised Rule 1 pattern.

  - **Address Missing Matches**:

    - **Action**: Identify compounds that should match a rule but are not, and adjust the pattern accordingly.
    - **Example**: If `4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid` is not matched by Rule 3, revise the pattern to include pyridine-containing side chains.

- **Advice 3: Refine Rule Definitions to Improve Specificity and Generality**

  - **Review and Revise Rule 13 (Complex Peptide-like Structures)**:

    - **Issue**: Rule 13 may be too broad or misapplied, leading to misclassifications.
    - **Solution**: Define the rule more precisely by specifying the number and position of amide bonds.
    - **Action**: Split Rule 13 into sub-rules that target specific structural elements, such as:

      - **Rule 13a**: Modifiers with **two or more consecutive amide bonds**.
      - **Rule 13b**: Modifiers with **cyclic peptides or macrocycles**.

    - **Adjust Patterns**: Use SMARTS patterns like `[*](C(=O)N[*]){2,}` to match multiple amide bonds.

- **Advice 4: Balance Rule Complexity**

  - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**:

    - **Action**: Remove unnecessary conditions that may overfit the data.
    - **Example**: In Rule 6, focus on the presence of long aliphatic chains with polar groups without over-specifying chain length.

  - **Generalize Where Appropriate**:

    - **Action**: Combine similar rules or broaden criteria to increase support.
    - **Example**: Merge rules related to electron-donating groups into a single rule with a generalized pattern.

- **Advice 5: Enhance Rule Matching Logic**

  - **Combine Conditions Appropriately**:

    - **Action**: Use logical AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and NOT (`!`) operators to accurately represent rule conditions.
    - **Example**: For Rule 9, create a SMARTS pattern that matches aromatic carboxylic acids AND has electron-donating groups, such as `[c][c]([OH,$(OC)])[c][c](C(=O)O)[c][c]`.

  - **Exclude Competing Functional Groups**:

    - **Action**: Explicitly exclude functional groups that negate the rule's effect.
    - **Example**: For rules promoting high yield, exclude modifiers with ketone groups near the carboxylate to avoid unintended matches.

- **Advice 6: Incorporate Additional Chemical Descriptors**

  - **Account for Steric Hindrance**:

    - **Action**: Include descriptors that consider the size and bulkiness of substituents.
    - **Example**: Use SMARTS patterns that limit the substitution at certain positions to small atoms like hydrogen.

  - **Consider Electronic Effects**:

    - **Action**: Incorporate electronic descriptors such as partial charges or proton affinity where possible.
    - **Example**: Use calculated properties to refine rules involving electron-withdrawing or donating groups.

- **Advice 7: Use Descriptive Variable Names and Comments in Code**

  - **Improve Code Readability**:

    - **Action**: Rename variables to clearly reflect the rule they represent.
    - **Example**: Use `is_alpha_amino_acid_with_extra_carboxyl` instead of `Rule1`.

  - **Seek Expert Input**:

    - **Action**: Collaborate with computational chemists to validate patterns.
    - **Benefit**: Ensures that the rules align with chemical principles and practical observations.

- **Advice 9: Iteratively Test and Validate Updated Rules**

  - **Cross-Validation**:

    - **Action**: Perform k-fold cross-validation to assess rule performance on different data splits.
    - **Benefit**: Reduces the risk of overfitting and improves generalizability.

  - **Monitor Performance Metrics**:

    - **Action**: Track precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each rule.
    - **Example**: Identify rules with high precision but low recall for further refinement.

- **Advice 10: Update and Optimize the Dataset**

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify Rules to Quantifiable Structural Features**

  Reframe the current rules to focus on quantifiable structural features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. Instead of complex descriptions, define rules based on the **presence, absence, or count of specific functional groups or atoms**. For example:
  
  - Count of **carboxylic acid groups (-COOH)**
  - Presence of **amino groups (-NH₂)**
  - Number of **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO₂, -CN)**
  - Count of **ring structures** or **heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, S)**
  
  This simplification will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix for modeling.

- **Advice 2**: **Develop a Standardized Functional Group List**

  Create a standardized list of functional groups and substituents relevant to the reaction's outcome. For each molecular modifier, compute binary (0 or 1) or numerical values representing:
  
  - **Presence or absence** of functional groups
  - **Counts** of specific groups (e.g., number of hydroxyl groups)
  - **Positions** of substituents on aromatic rings (e.g., ortho, meta, para)
  
  This approach enables consistent feature extraction from SMILES strings.

- **Advice 3**: **Utilize Cheminformatics Tools for Descriptor Calculation**

  Employ cheminformatics software like **RDKit** to calculate molecular descriptors and fingerprints directly from SMILES strings. Descriptors can include:
  
  - **Molecular weight**
  - **Topological polar surface area (TPSA)**
  - **LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient)**
  - **Hydrogen bond donors and acceptors**
  - **Partial charges**
  
  These numerical descriptors can populate the feature matrix for quantitative analysis.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Electronic and Steric Parameters**

  Calculate specific electronic and steric parameters that numerically represent the functional groups' effects, such as:
  
  - **Hammett sigma constants** for substituents on aromatic rings to quantify electronic effects
  - **Taft steric parameters** to represent steric hindrance
  - **Sterimol parameters** for detailed steric profiles
  
  Including these parameters will quantify underlying physical-chemical properties affecting the yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Simplify and Combine Similar Rules**

  Review and merge similar rules to reduce complexity, focusing on the most impactful features. For example:
  
  - Combine rules about **electron-withdrawing groups** affecting yield into a single rule with numerical values representing their strength.
  - Generalize rules for **nitrogen-containing heterocycles** by quantifying the number of nitrogen atoms and ring types.
  
  Simplification enhances interpretability and ease of feature extraction.

- **Advice 6**: **Use Categorical Variables and One-Hot Encoding**

  Assign categorical variables to structural features and apply one-hot encoding to convert them into numerical format. Examples include:
  
  - **Ring types** (e.g., benzene, pyridine, pyrazole)
  - **Side chain types** (e.g., aliphatic, aromatic, heteroaromatic)
  - **Substituent types** (e.g., electron-donating, electron-withdrawing)
  
  This method captures structural diversity numerically.

- **Advice 7**: **Employ Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Models**

  Shift from qualitative rules to QSAR models that predict yield based on numerical descriptors. This approach can reveal complex relationships between structural features and reaction outcomes.

- **Advice 8**: **Implement Machine Learning for Feature Importance**

  Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forest, gradient boosting) to:
  
  - Identify the most significant features influencing yield
  - Aid in refining rules based on feature importance scores
  - Discover non-linear relationships and interactions between features

- **Advice 9**: **Address Exceptions and Outliers**

  Investigate modifiers that do not conform to existing rules to understand discrepancies. Adjust rules by:
  
  - Adding exceptions or caveats
  - Introducing new descriptors that capture overlooked features
  - Revising rules to account for additional factors influencing yield

- **Advice 10**: **Enhance Rules with Clear Definitions and Thresholds**

  Provide precise definitions and thresholds within rules for clarity. For example:
  
  - Specify what constitutes a **"long-chain"** aliphatic acid (e.g., chains with **n ≥ 6 carbons**)
  - Define a threshold for **"multiple"** substituents (e.g., **two or more** electron-withdrawing groups)
  
  Clear criteria ensure consistent feature extraction and rule application.

- **Advice 11**: **Create a Feature Matrix Template**

  Develop a template for the feature matrix that lists all descriptors and their calculation methods. This includes:
  
  - **Descriptor names**
  - **Data types** (binary, numeric)
  - **Calculation formulas or software used**
  
  A standardized template streamlines data processing and analysis.

- **Advice 12**: **Validate and Iterate on Rules Using Cross-Validation**

  Perform cross-validation on the dataset to test the revised rules and descriptors. Use findings to:
  
  - Refine rules further
  - Identify additional features to include
  - Enhance predictive accuracy

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, distinguishing between thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) and aromatic rings (low yield). The explanation that thiol groups on aromatic rings may block active sites is insightful. The rule effectively combines functional group positions, meeting complexity requirements. It is supported by contrasting data points (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), ensuring solid coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly asserts that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to high yield. The insight about minimal steric hindrance is logical. While the rule is simpler and less complex, it is acceptable. Coverage is limited to one data point (octanoic acid), indicating that additional examples are needed to strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly explains that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional polar groups result in low yield. The provided insight on steric hindrance and unfavorable interactions is adequate. The rule combines multiple structural features, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly identifies that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid lead to low yield. The physical-chemical explanation about unwanted side reactions and stable chelate formation is sound. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, meeting complexity standards. It is supported by several data points (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly states that modifiers with multiple ether linkages or polyether chains tend to result in low yield. The insight regarding interference with metal coordination due to ether oxygen atoms is appropriate. The rule combines structural features effectively. It is supported by at least two data points (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), satisfying coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear in differentiating α-amino acids with nitrogenous aromatic side chains (high yield) from those with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains (low yield). The explanation about additional coordination sites from nitrogen atoms is valid. The rule combines multiple functional groups, adhering to complexity. It is supported by data points for both high (tryptophan) and low yield (phenylalanine), ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly explains that N-acetylated or blocked amino groups in modifiers lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight about reduced coordination sites is sufficient. The rule considers specific structural modifications, fulfilling complexity. However, coverage is limited to one example ((2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), indicating that more data points are needed to validate the rule fully.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly states that heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids tend to result in low yield. The provided insight about altered electronic properties disrupting coordination is acceptable. The rule considers multiple fluorine substitutions, meeting complexity criteria. Coverage is limited to one data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), suggesting the need for additional examples.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly indicates that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains lead to high yield due to enhanced coordination. The physical-chemical explanation is adequate. The rule combines several functional groups, adhering to complexity. Coverage is limited to one data point ((2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), so additional data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 clearly states that modifiers with amide linkages or peptide-like structures tend to result in low yield. The insight about intramolecular hydrogen bonding reducing coordination is valid. The rule combines complex structural features, fulfilling complexity. Coverage is limited to one example (2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid), indicating that more data points are needed for strong validation.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with additional carboxylate groups in their side chains**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids containing an **amino group (-NH₂)** and two **carboxylic acid groups (-COOH)**—one on the α-carbon and one on the side chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of multiple carboxylate groups allows for **multidentate coordination** with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stabilization and activity, leading to higher yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NH₂) at the para position**, such as **4-aminobenzoic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: A benzene ring with a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **amino group (-NH₂)** directly opposite (para) to it.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The amino group can act as an additional **coordination site**, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)** groups, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings bearing a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **electron-withdrawing group** at the para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the **acidity** of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center, thereby improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **electron-donating group** at the para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-donating substituents decrease the **acidity** of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal center, which reduces catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids**, such as **pyridinecarboxylic acids** and **pyrazolecarboxylic acids**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Heteroaromatic rings with one or more **nitrogen atoms** and a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms provide additional **coordination sites** for metal binding, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and stabilizing the catalyst's active form.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **thiol groups (-SH) on aliphatic chains** tend to result in **high yield**, while those with **thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a **thiol group (-SH)** on the side chain.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with a **thiol group (-SH)** attached directly to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Thiol groups on aliphatic chains can coordinate effectively with the metal without causing catalyst poisoning.
    - **Low Yield**: Thiol groups on aromatic rings may bind too strongly to the metal center, **blocking active sites** and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups**, such as **octanoic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Straight-chain aliphatic acids containing only a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The absence of additional functional groups reduces **steric hindrance** and avoids competing interactions, allowing the carboxyl group to coordinate effectively with the metal center.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional polar functional groups**, such as **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains of seven carbons or more with **polar functional groups** besides the **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Additional polar groups can cause **steric hindrance** and **unfavorable intramolecular interactions**, hindering effective coordination between the carboxyl group and the metal center.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde (-CHO)** or **ketone (>C=O)** groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids with **carbonyl groups** (aldehyde or ketone) near the **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Proximity of additional carbonyl groups may lead to **unwanted side reactions** or formation of **stable chelate rings** with the metal center, altering the catalyst's activity and decreasing the yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages (-O-)** or **polyether chains** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids with **ether bonds** in their structure, creating flexible, **polar polyether chains**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms may interfere with coordination between the carboxyl group and the metal center. Increased flexibility and polarity can reduce effective interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those with **non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains**, such as **phenylalanine**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., indole ring).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **non-nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., benzene ring).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen atoms in the side chain provide additional **coordination sites**, enhancing metal binding and catalyst activity.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of extra coordination sites results in weaker metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **N-acetylated amino groups** or **blocked amino groups** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group is acylated or modified**, forming an **amide bond**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Blocking the amino group reduces the number of available **coordination sites**, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids**, particularly those with multiple **fluorine atoms**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a high degree of **fluorination** along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine increases the acidity of the carboxylic acid but may also enhance **hydrophobicity** and decrease **solubility** in the reaction medium. Altered electronic properties can disrupt effective coordination with the metal catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains** tend to result in **high yield** due to enhanced coordination.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic acids containing several **hydroxyl groups** in addition to the **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups offer additional **hydrogen bonding** and potential **coordination sites**, improving metal-ligand interactions and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **amide linkages** or **peptide-like structures** tend to result in **low yield** due to competing interactions and reduced coordination.

  - **Chemical Features**: Compounds containing **amide bonds** or resembling **peptides**, with **multiple functional groups**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: **Intramolecular hydrogen bonding** and **conformational constraints** from amide linkages may reduce the availability of coordination sites. Multiple functional groups might compete for metal binding, disrupting effective catalyst-modifier interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines multiple functional groups and considers their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **For Rule 1**, the code does not correctly identify amino acids with additional carboxylate groups in their side chains. The current SMARTS patterns for the amino group (`[NX3][CX4]`) and the carboxylic acid group (`[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`) are too generic and do not ensure that the amino group is on the α-carbon and that there are two carboxylic acid groups in specific positions (α-carbon and side chain). To improve this, use more specific SMARTS patterns that capture the α-amino acid structure with an additional carboxylate in the side chain. For example, modify the patterns to:
  - Amino acid backbone: `[NX3][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` (amino group attached to α-carbon, which is connected to a carboxylic acid group)
  - Additional carboxylic acid in side chain: `[*][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`
  - Ensure that there are at least two carboxylic acid groups and that the amino group is connected to the α-carbon.

- **Suggestion 2**: **For Rule 2**, the SMARTS pattern `'c1ccc(N)cc1'` does not account for the carboxylic acid group at the correct position relative to the amino group. To accurately capture aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the para position, use a SMARTS pattern that specifies the positions of both the amino and carboxylic acid groups on the aromatic ring. For example:
  - `'c1ccc(cc1)[NX3H2]'` for the amino group at para position
  - Include a pattern for the carboxylic acid group at the para position relative to the amino group: `'c1cc([NX3H2])ccc1C(=O)O'`

- **Suggestion 3**: **For Rule 3**, the patterns for electron-withdrawing groups at the para position are too narrow. The current patterns only consider nitro groups or halogens. Broaden the patterns to include other electron-withdrawing groups such as cyano (`-CN`) or trifluoromethyl (`-CF₃`). Adjust the patterns to:
  - `'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1[!R]'` where `[!R]` represents any electron-withdrawing group at the para position.

- **Suggestion 4**: **For Rule 4**, similarly, the patterns for electron-donating groups are limited. Expand the patterns to include other electron-donating groups like methoxy (`-OCH₃`) or alkoxy groups. Adjust the SMARTS patterns to:
  - `'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1[OX2][CX4]'` to capture para-substituted hydroxyl or alkoxy groups.

- **Suggestion 5**: **For Rule 5**, the patterns for nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids should include common heterocycles like pyridine, pyrimidine, imidazole, and pyrazole rings with a carboxylic acid substituent. Expand the SMARTS patterns to:
  - `'[nH]1cccc1C(=O)O'` for pyrrole carboxylic acid
  - `'n1ccccc1C(=O)O'` for pyridine carboxylic acid
  - Include patterns for other heterocycles: `'c1cnc[nH]1C(=O)O'`, `'c1ncc[nH]1C(=O)O'`

- **Suggestion 6**: **For Rule 6**, distinguish between thiol groups on aliphatic chains and those attached to aromatic rings by specifying the connectivity in the SMARTS patterns. For high yield (aliphatic thiols), use:
  - `'[CX4][SX2H]'` (thiol group attached to an aliphatic carbon)
  - For low yield (aromatic thiols), use:
  - `'[c][SX2H]'` (thiol group attached directly to an aromatic ring)

- **Suggestion 7**: **For Rule 7 and Rule 8**, the patterns are too simplistic. Instead of using `'C' * 7` to represent long aliphatic chains, use SMARTS patterns that specify chains of a certain length without functional groups. For Rule 7 (high yield modifiers), use:
  - `'CCCCCCC[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` (aliphatic chain of at least 7 carbons ending with a carboxylic acid)
  - Exclude molecules with additional functional groups by explicitly excluding patterns for hydroxyl, amino, and ether groups in the chain.

- **Suggestion 8**: **For Rule 9**, ensure that the aldehyde or ketone groups are adjacent to the carboxylic acid group. Adjust the SMARTS patterns to:
  - `'[CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` (ketone adjacent to carboxylic acid)
  - `'[CX3H1](=O)[#6][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` (aldehyde group near carboxylic acid)

- **Suggestion 9**: **For Rule 10**, to detect polyether chains, count the number of ether linkages in the molecule. Modify the SMARTS patterns to:
  - Use a recursive SMARTS pattern to match multiple ether linkages: `[$([#6][OX2][#6])]` and specify that there should be at least two occurrences.

- **Suggestion 10**: **For Rule 11**, differentiate between nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains and non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains in α-amino acids. For high yield, use patterns that match indole or pyrrole rings attached to the side chain:
  - `'[NX3][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` for α-amino acid backbone
  - `'[CX4][C](C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])([NX3])c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2'` for tryptophan-like side chain
  - For low yield, include patterns for phenylalanine-like side chains:
  - `'[CX4][C](C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])([NX3])c1ccccc1'`

- **Suggestion 11**: **For Rule 12**, ensure that the patterns capture N-acetylated or blocked amino groups correctly. The current pattern `'[NX3][CX3](=O)'` may match amide groups in general. To specifically target N-acetylated α-amino acids, modify the pattern to:
  - `'[NX3][CX3](=O)[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` (amide linkage at the amino group of an α-amino acid)

- **Suggestion 12**: **For Rule 13**, to identify heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids, adjust the patterns to:
  - `'[CX4](F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)'` to detect chains with multiple fluorinated carbons
  - Ensure that the count of fluorine atoms is accurate by counting all fluorine atoms in the molecule, not just in specific patterns.

- **Suggestion 13**: **For Rule 14**, to detect modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains, adjust the patterns to:
  - `'[CX4][OX2H]'` (hydroxyl group on an aliphatic carbon)
  - Use count thresholds to ensure that there are at least two such hydroxyl groups in the molecule.

- **Suggestion 14**: **For Rule 15**, recognize amide linkages or peptide-like structures by adjusting the patterns to capture peptide bonds. Use patterns like:
  - `'[NX3][CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3](=O)'` for dipeptides
  - `'[NX3][CX3](=O)[CX4][NX3][CX3](=O)'` to capture longer peptide chains

- **Suggestion 15**: **General Improvement**: Ensure that all SMARTS patterns are correctly specified and compiled without errors. Use RDKit's tools to validate SMARTS syntax and test patterns individually against known compounds to verify that they match the intended functional groups.

- **Suggestion 16**: **Error Handling**: Implement better error handling in the code to catch and report any issues with SMARTS pattern compilation or molecule parsing. This will help identify and fix pattern-related problems.

- **Suggestion 17**: **Pattern Testing**: Before applying the patterns to the dataset, test each SMARTS pattern against a set of test molecules (including the examples provided in the rules) to ensure that they match the expected structures.

- **Suggestion 18**: **Position Specificity**: For rules that depend on substituent positions (e.g., para positions in aromatic rings), use SMARTS patterns that specify the relative positions of substituents explicitly.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**Overview**

The objective of our research program is to develop a set of rules that effectively predict the outcome (high or low yield) of a catalytic reaction based on the structural features of molecular modifiers. The performance of these rules is assessed using various metrics, with a particular focus on **confidence** and **lift**, which are critical indicators of the rules' predictive power and their ability to enhance our understanding of the underlying chemistry.

In this analysis, we will compare the **current rule metrics** with the **reference (previous) metrics** to evaluate the improvements achieved and identify areas for further enhancement.

---

**Comparison of Metrics**

1. **Support**

   - **Previous Metrics**:
     - **Train Support**: [0.1667, 0.1845]
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - **Train Support**: 0.0876

   - **Observation**: The current rules have a lower support compared to the previous rules. This indicates that the current rules cover a smaller proportion of the dataset.

2. **Confidence**

   - **Previous Metrics**:
     - **Train Confidence**: [0.6352, 0.5396]
     - **Test Confidence**: [0.3333, 0.4639]
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - **Train Confidence**: 0.7890

   - **Observation**: There is a significant increase in the train confidence from the previous average (~0.5874) to the current value (0.7890). This suggests that the current rules are more accurate in predicting high yields when applied to the training data.

3. **Lift**

   - **Previous Metrics**:
     - **Train Lift**: [1.2048, 1.0559]
     - **Test Lift**: [0.6889, 0.9137]
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - **Train Lift**: 1.5783

   - **Observation**: The lift has also improved substantially from an average of around 1.1304 to 1.5783. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance, and a higher lift signifies a stronger association between the rule conditions and the prediction.

4. **Leverage**

   - **Previous Metrics**:
     - **Train Leverage**: [0.0289, -0.0041]
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - **Train Leverage**: 0.0215

   - **Observation**: The leverage remains positive and comparable to previous values, indicating that the rules are contributing additional predictive power beyond what would be expected by chance.

---

**Interpretation**

- The **increase in confidence** from approximately 0.5874 to 0.7890 suggests that the current rules are more reliable in predicting high yields when the rule conditions are met.
- The **increase in lift** from approximately 1.1304 to 1.5783 indicates a stronger association between the structural features identified in the rules and the desired outcome. This means that the modifiers fitting these rules are significantly more likely to result in high yields compared to the average probability in the dataset.
- The **decrease in support** from around 0.1756 to 0.0876 shows that the current rules apply to a smaller subset of the data. This implies that while the rules are more precise, they may not cover as many cases as before.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum**: Given the substantial improvement in both confidence and lift, it appears that we have not yet reached a local minimum. The performance of the rules continues to improve with each iteration, especially in terms of predictive accuracy.
- **Iterations**: However, the decrease in support suggests that we might be overfitting to the training data by focusing on very specific features that do not generalize well. This necessitates a careful balance between increasing confidence/lift and maintaining adequate support.

---

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Balance Between Support and Confidence**

   - Aim to **increase the support** of the rules without significantly compromising confidence and lift. This can be achieved by generalizing some rules to cover a broader range of modifiers.
   - **Combine similar rules** where appropriate to create broader categories that still maintain high confidence.

2. **Validation with Test Data**

   - Evaluate the current rules using a **test dataset** to ensure that the improvements in confidence and lift are not due to overfitting. Monitoring test confidence and lift will provide insights into the generalizability of the rules.
   - **Previous Test Metrics** showed lower confidence and lift compared to training metrics, indicating potential overfitting. Including test metrics for current rules would help assess improvement.

3. **Simplification of Rules**

   - **Simplify overly complex rules** to enhance their applicability and reduce the chances of overfitting. Rules that are too specific may not generalize well to new data.
   - Focus on the most significant structural features that contribute to high yield, possibly identified through feature importance analysis.

4. **Inclusion of Additional Data**

   - **Incorporate more data points** if available to increase the support and validate the rules over a larger dataset.
   - **Explore modifiers** that are exceptions to the current rules to understand and adjust for outliers.

5. **Cross-Validation**

   - Utilize **cross-validation techniques** to assess the stability and reliability of the rules across different subsets of the data.
   - This will help in ensuring that the high confidence and lift are consistent and not specific to a particular split.

6. **Focus on Underrepresented Areas**

   - Identify areas or modifier types that are underrepresented in the current rules yet have significant impact on yield.
   - **Develop new rules** or **refine existing ones** to include these modifiers, potentially increasing support.

7. **Chemical Expertise Integration**

   - Engage with **chemical domain experts** to verify the plausibility of the rules based on chemical theory and known mechanisms. This can help in refining rules to be both chemically meaningful and statistically significant.
   - **Re-express some rules** to align better with established chemical knowledge, making them more intuitive and potentially more generalizable.

---

**Conclusion**

The current iteration of rules shows a marked improvement in **confidence** and **lift**, indicating enhanced predictive power and a stronger association between the identified structural features and high yields. However, the decrease in support suggests that the rules apply to fewer cases, which may limit their practical utility.

To further improve the rules:

- Strive for a better balance between **precision and coverage** by generalizing rules where possible.
- Validate the rules using **test data** to ensure they generalize well and are not overfitting.
- Simplify complex rules to make them more broadly applicable and easier to interpret and apply.
- Continue iterating with these considerations in mind until improvements in metrics plateau, indicating that a local minimum may have been reached.

By following these recommendations, we can develop a robust set of rules that not only predict high yields with high confidence but also apply to a wider range of modifiers, ultimately aiding in the efficient design and optimization of catalytic reactions.

**Comments on Accuracies of the Validation and Training Sets:**

The current iteration of the classification model has achieved a **5-fold cross-validation accuracy of approximately 74.29%**. This represents an improvement compared to some of the previous iterations, where accuracies varied between **60%** and **65.71%**, and is slightly lower than the highest previously observed validation accuracy of **76%**. The increase in accuracy suggests that the recent modifications to the feature matrix and the underlying rules have enhanced the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

Given that the validation accuracy is reasonably high and there is no significant discrepancy between the training and validation accuracies (assuming the training accuracy is comparable), the model does not exhibit clear signs of overfitting. However, without explicit training accuracy metrics, we cannot conclusively rule out subtle overfitting. The slight fluctuation in validation accuracies across iterations indicates that the model is responsive to changes in the rules and that further refinements may still improve performance.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides valuable insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions for individual molecules. By examining molecules where the model's predictions do not align with experimental values, we can identify which rules may be contributing to misclassifications.

   - **Molecule:** *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
   - **Prediction vs. Experimental:** Predicted High, Experimental Low
   - **Key Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
     - **Rule 4:** SHAP value = 0.02786

     - **Rule 13:** SHAP value = 0.03574
     - **Rule 15:** SHAP value = 0.04524

   - **Observations:**
     - The combined positive contributions of these rules led to an overestimation of the modifier loading.
     - **Rules 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 15** may be overemphasizing features that do not correlate with high experimental loading for this molecule.

2. **Molecules with Predicted Low Loading but Experimental High Loading:**

   - **Molecule:** *C1=CC2=C(C=C1C(=O)O)C(=O)OC2=O*

     - **Rule 9:** SHAP value = 0.02158

   - **Observations:**
     - **Rule 10** has a large negative SHAP value, significantly decreasing the predicted loading.
     - This suggests that **Rule 10** may be underestimating the contribution of features that correlate with high loading in this case.

3. **Consistent Overestimation of Loading:**

   - Several molecules, such as *C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O*, have predicted high loading but experimental low loading.
   - **Positive SHAP Values:** Rules 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15
   - These rules consistently contribute positively, potentially leading to overestimation.

4. **Consistent Underestimation of Loading:**

   - Molecules like *C1=CC2=C(C=C1C(=O)O)C(=O)OC2=O* show underestimation due to negative contributions from some rules, notably **Rule 10**.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

The improvement in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules is more effective than in previous iterations. However, the presence of misclassifications indicates that there is still room for improvement. The model may benefit from refining certain rules to better capture the structural features that influence the modifier loading.

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- **Rule 4 (Modifiers with Electron-Donating Groups at Para Position Result in Low Yield):**

  - This rule has positive SHAP values for some molecules where the experimental loading is low, supporting its validity.
  - However, it also contributes positively to the predicted high loading for molecules with low experimental loading, indicating potential overgeneralization.

- **Rule 8 (Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Polar Groups Result in Low Yield):**

  - Positive SHAP contributions in overestimations suggest that the rule may not fully account for the complexity introduced by additional functional groups.

- **Rule 10 (Modifiers with Multiple Ether Linkages Result in Low Yield):**

  - The significant negative SHAP value for **Rule 10** in underestimated molecules implies that this rule may be too harsh, penalizing modifiers that should result in high loading.

- **Rule 12 (Modifiers with Blocked Amino Groups Result in Low Yield):**

  - Positive SHAP values in overestimated cases may indicate that the rule does not sufficiently differentiate between various types of amino group modifications.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules:**

The current rules have enhanced the model's accuracy compared to some previous iterations, indicating effectiveness in capturing relevant molecular features. However, discrepancies highlighted by the SHAP analysis suggest that certain rules may be overemphasizing or underrepresenting specific structural attributes, leading to misclassifications.

- The improvement in accuracy suggests progress, but the presence of systematic errors implies that the model may have reached a local minimum.
- Iterations have led to refinements, but further adjustments are necessary to address the remaining misclassifications.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Rule 4 (Electron-Donating Groups):**

   - **Issue:** Rule 4 contributes to overestimations in some cases.
   - **Recommendation:** Modify the rule to account for the position and influence of electron-donating groups more precisely.
     - **Action:** Specify that electron-donating groups at positions other than the para position may have different effects, or consider the impact of multiple substituents.

2. **Adjust Rule 8 (Long-Chain Aliphatic Acids with Polar Groups):**

   - **Issue:** Rule 8 may not fully capture the steric and electronic effects of additional polar functional groups.
   - **Recommendation:** Incorporate considerations for the spacing and steric hindrance caused by these groups.
     - **Action:** Differentiate between modifiers where polar groups are sterically hindering coordination and those where they may enhance coordination through additional interactions.

3. **Re-evaluate Rule 10 (Multiple Ether Linkages):**

   - **Issue:** Rule 10's strong negative influence may be causing underestimations.
   - **Recommendation:** Soften the rule to distinguish between different types and positions of ether linkages.
     - **Action:** Consider whether ether linkages distant from the coordination site impact yield differently than those proximal to it.

4. **Clarify Rule 12 (Blocked Amino Groups):**

   - **Issue:** Rule 12 may not account for partial blocking or the presence of other coordinating groups.
   - **Recommendation:** Specify the degree to which amino groups are blocked and consider compensatory coordination from other functional groups.
     - **Action:** Modify the rule to reflect that partial blocking or reversible modifications might still allow effective coordination.

5. **Incorporate Rule Interactions:**

   - **Issue:** Current rules may be acting independently without considering synergistic or antagonistic interactions.
   - **Recommendation:** Introduce rules that account for the combined effects of multiple functional groups.
     - **Action:** Develop new rules or refine existing ones to capture the interplay between different substituents.

6. **Address Overfitting by Simplifying Overly Complex Rules:**

   - **Issue:** Some rules may be too specific, causing the model to fit noise rather than underlying patterns.
   - **Recommendation:** Generalize rules where appropriate to improve model generalization.
     - **Action:** Remove unnecessary complexity in rules that do not significantly improve predictive power.

7. **Expand the Dataset for Better Generalization:**

   - **Issue:** Limited data may cause the model to overfit to specific cases.
   - **Recommendation:** Include more experimental data to provide a broader basis for rule evaluation.
     - **Action:** Augment the training set with additional molecules exhibiting a variety of structural features.

**Conclusion:**

By analyzing the SHAP values and the model's performance, it is evident that while the current rules have improved accuracy, certain rules are contributing to systematic errors. Refining these rules by incorporating the recommendations above should help in enhancing the model's predictive capability. Iterative evaluation and adjustment of the rules, guided by SHAP analysis insights, will allow for continued improvement while avoiding overfitting. It's important to test the revised rules in subsequent iterations to assess their impact on model performance and ensure that the model moves beyond any local minima in accuracy.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization**

*We have conducted an extensive analysis of the current set of rules aimed at predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on molecular modifiers derived from SMILES representations. While the current rules have shown improvements in certain performance metrics, there are areas where further optimization is needed to enhance their predictive power and generalizability.*

1. **Performance Metrics Analysis**:
   - **Confidence and Lift Improvements**: The current rules exhibit higher confidence (approximately 78.90%) and lift (1.5783) in the training data compared to previous iterations. This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, they are more likely to predict the correct outcome than by random chance.
   - **Reduced Support**: The support has decreased (from around 17.56% to 8.76%), meaning the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. This reduction might limit the practical applicability of the rules.
   - **Potential Overfitting**: The validation accuracy, while improved to 74.29%, shows discrepancies when compared to certain misclassifications revealed by the SHAP analysis. This suggests possible overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but less so on unseen data.

2. **SHAP Analysis Insights**:
   - **Misclassifications Identified**: Instances where the model predicts high yield but the experimental yield is low, and vice versa, have been observed.
   - **Influential Rules**: Certain rules (e.g., Rule 4, Rule 8, Rule 9, Rule 10, Rule 12, Rule 13, Rule 15) contribute significantly to incorrect predictions, as indicated by their SHAP values.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns**:
   - **Increase Specificity**: Modify SMARTS patterns to more precisely capture the chemical structures described in each rule. For example:
     - **Rule 1**: Adjust the pattern to specifically identify α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylate groups, ensuring the amino group is on the α-carbon.
     - **Rule 2**: Specify the positions of both the amino and carboxylic acid groups on the aromatic ring to accurately capture para-substituted aromatic amines.
   - **Expand Functional Group Recognition**: Include additional electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups in the SMARTS patterns for Rules 3 and 4 to cover a broader range of substituents.

2. **Improve Rule Generalization**:
   - **Balance Support and Confidence**: Generalize rules where possible to increase support (coverage of the dataset) without significantly reducing confidence and lift.
   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: Ensure that rules are not overly specific, which can lead to overfitting. Simplify rules by focusing on the most impactful structural features.

3. **Re-express and Combine Rules**:
   - **Consider Rule Interactions**: Explore the interactions between different rules and functional groups. Modify rules to account for synergistic or antagonistic effects of multiple substituents.
   - **Aggregate Similar Rules**: Combine rules that capture similar chemical features to improve coverage and simplify the model.

4. **Validate with Test Data**:
   - **Assess Generalizability**: Evaluate the performance of the rules on a separate test dataset to ensure they generalize well beyond the training data.
   - **Adjust Based on Test Performance**: Refine rules that perform poorly on test data, especially those contributing to misclassifications as identified by SHAP analysis.

5. **Incorporate Chemical Expertise**:
   - **Consult Chemists**: Engage with chemical experts to ensure that the rules align with known chemical principles and reaction mechanisms.
   - **Verify Chemical Plausibility**: Reassess rules that may not be chemically intuitive or that contradict established understanding.

6. **Address Specific Rule Issues**:
   - **Rule 4 (Electron-Donating Groups)**:
     - **Issue**: May contribute to overestimations.
     - **Action**: Refine the rule to more accurately represent the impact of electron-donating groups at different positions.
   - **Rule 8 (Polar Functional Groups on Aliphatic Chains)**:
     - **Issue**: May not fully account for steric and electronic effects.
     - **Action**: Differentiate between various polar groups and their positions to better predict their influence on yield.
   - **Rule 10 (Multiple Ether Linkages)**:
     - **Issue**: Strong negative influence may cause underestimations.
     - **Action**: Soften the rule by considering the impact of ether linkage positions relative to the coordination site.
   - **Rule 12 (Blocked Amino Groups)**:
     - **Issue**: May not account for partially blocked amino groups or the presence of other coordinating groups.
     - **Action**: Clarify the degree of amino group blocking and consider compensatory coordination from other functional groups.

7. **Enhance Rule Specificity with Position Specificity**:
   - **Substituent Positions**: Use SMARTS patterns that specify the relative positions of substituents on aromatic rings (e.g., ortho, meta, para) for rules that depend on substituent positions.

8. **Increase Dataset Diversity**:
   - **Expand Training Data**: Include more compounds with diverse structural features to improve the robustness of the rules.
   - **Include Challenging Cases**: Incorporate modifiers that are exceptions to current rules to refine rule boundaries.

9. **Implement Better Error Handling and Testing**:
   - **Validate SMARTS Patterns**: Use tools like RDKit to test and validate SMARTS patterns against known compounds.
   - **Error Reporting**: Improve error handling in code to catch and correct issues with pattern compilation or molecule parsing.

10. **Iterative Refinement**:
    - **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update the rules based on new data and performance metrics.
    - **Monitor Overfitting**: Use cross-validation and monitor performance on validation and test sets to detect and prevent overfitting.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

*Based on the current analysis, there is significant potential for further optimization of the rules without overfitting. The disparities between training performance and validation results, along with insights from the SHAP analysis, indicate that the rules can be refined to improve generalization. By focusing on increasing support, simplifying overly specific rules, and ensuring chemical plausibility, we can enhance the predictive power of the model while avoiding overfitting.*

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines multiple functional groups and considers their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Increased Specificity**  
  Modify the SMARTS patterns in the rules to more precisely capture the intended chemical structures. For example:
  - **Rule 1**: Adjust the pattern to specifically identify α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylate groups, ensuring the amino group is bonded to the α-carbon and there are additional carboxyl groups on the side chain.
  - **Rule 2**: Specify the para positions of both the amino group (-NH₂) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the aromatic ring to accurately identify para-substituted aromatic amines.

- **Advice 2**: **Expand Functional Group Recognition in SMARTS Patterns**  
  Enhance the SMARTS patterns in Rules 3 and 4 to include a broader range of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups. This will improve the coverage and applicability of the rules to compounds with various substituents.

- **Advice 3**: **Simplify Overly Specific Rules to Increase Support**  
  Generalize rules where possible to cover more compounds in the dataset. Avoid overly complex rules by focusing on the most impactful structural features that influence yield, thereby increasing the rules' support without significantly reducing confidence and lift.

- **Advice 4**: **Address Specific Issues in Problematic Rules**  
  Review and refine rules that contribute to misclassifications:
  - **Rule 4 (Electron-Donating Groups)**: Refine the rule to account for the position of electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring and their varying effects depending on their location (ortho, meta, para).
  - **Rule 8 (Polar Functional Groups on Aliphatic Chains)**: Differentiate between types of polar groups and their positions to better predict their influence on yield, considering steric and electronic effects.
  - **Rule 10 (Multiple Ether Linkages)**: Adjust the rule to consider the impact of ether linkage positions relative to the coordination site, potentially softening its negative influence on yield prediction.
  - **Rule 12 (Blocked Amino Groups)**: Clarify the extent of amino group blocking and account for the presence of other coordinating groups that might compensate for reduced coordination.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance Rule Specificity with Substituent Position Information**  
  Incorporate the specific positions of substituents on aromatic rings into the SMARTS patterns. This includes specifying ortho, meta, or para positions to improve the accuracy of rules dependent on substituent location.

- **Advice 6**: **Consider Interactions Between Functional Groups**  
  Modify or create rules to account for synergistic or antagonistic effects arising from multiple substituents. Evaluate how different functional groups interact and influence the overall yield, adjusting the rules to reflect these interactions.

- **Advice 7**: **Aggregate Similar Rules to Simplify the Model**  
  Combine rules that capture similar chemical features or trends to improve coverage and reduce complexity. For example, merge rules related to different types of nitrogen-containing heterocycles that have similar effects on yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Validate Rules with External Test Data**  
  Test the refined rules on an independent dataset to assess their generalizability. Use the results to further adjust the rules, focusing on those that lead to misclassifications in the test data.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Chemical Expertise into Rule Development**  
  Collaborate with chemists to ensure that the rules are chemically sound and aligned with established reaction mechanisms. Verify that the rules make sense from a chemical standpoint and adjust any that contradict known principles.

- **Advice 10**: **Improve Error Handling and SMARTS Validation**  
  Utilize cheminformatics tools like RDKit to validate SMARTS patterns, ensuring they correctly identify the intended molecular features without errors. Implement error handling to catch issues during pattern compilation or molecule parsing.

These rules have been developed by thoroughly analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures (functional groups) and considers their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups (-COOH)**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids with an **amino group (-NH₂)**, a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** on the α-carbon, and an additional **carboxyl group** in the side chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple carboxyl groups act as **multidentate ligands**, enhancing coordination with the metal center. This strengthens the catalyst's stability and activity, leading to higher yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings bearing a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and an **electron-withdrawing group** at the para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the **acidity** of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center. This improved coordination strengthens the catalyst's effectiveness.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and an **electron-donating group** at the para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-donating groups decrease the **acidity** of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal center. This leads to reduced catalyst effectiveness and lower yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms**, such as **pyridinecarboxylic acids** and **pyrazolecarboxylic acids**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings containing **nitrogen atoms** (heteroatoms) and bearing a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms offer additional **coordination sites** for metal binding, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with thiol groups (-SH) on aliphatic chains** tend to result in **high yield**, while those with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a **thiol group (-SH)** on the side chain.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with a **thiol group (-SH)** attached directly to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Thiol groups on aliphatic chains can coordinate effectively without causing catalyst poisoning.
    - **Low Yield**: Thiol groups on aromatic rings may bind too strongly to the metal center, **blocking active sites** and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those with additional polar functional groups tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Straight-chain aliphatic acids containing only a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.
    - **Low Yield**: Aliphatic chains with additional **polar functional groups** like **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Minimal steric hindrance allows effective coordination with the metal center.
    - **Low Yield**: Additional polar groups introduce **steric hindrance** and competing interactions, hindering coordination and reducing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **Octanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains, such as **phenylalanine**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., indole ring).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **non-nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., benzene ring).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen atoms provide extra **coordination sites**, enhancing metal binding and catalyst activity.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of additional coordination sites results in weaker metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids possessing **carbonyl groups** near the **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Additional carbonyl groups may lead to **unwanted side reactions** or form **stable chelate rings** with the metal center, altering catalyst activity and decreasing yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages (-O-) or polyether chains** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids with one or more **ether bonds** in their structure, creating flexible, polar chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms may disrupt coordination between the carboxyl group and the metal center. Increased flexibility and polarity can reduce effective interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple **fluorine atoms** along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine increases the **acidity** but may also enhance **hydrophobicity** and decrease **solubility**. Altered electronic properties can disrupt effective coordination with the metal catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **blocked or acylated amino groups**, forming **amide linkages**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group is acylated or modified**, creating an **amide bond**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Blocking the amino group reduces available **coordination sites**, weakening metal-ligand interactions necessary for effective catalysis.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups at positions other than para**, or with multiple functional groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with **hydroxyl (-OH)** or other groups not optimally positioned for coordination.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Misplaced functional groups may cause **steric hindrance** or form **intramolecular hydrogen bonds**, interfering with metal coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains**, such as **sugar acids**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains with several **hydroxyl groups** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups offer additional **hydrogen bonding** and potential **coordination sites**, improving metal-ligand interactions and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents or multiple heteroatoms** may have varying effects on yield depending on their ability to coordinate effectively.

  - **Chemical Features**: Compounds with complex structures, including multiple rings or heteroatoms, and **carboxyl groups (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Bulky groups may introduce **steric hindrance**, but additional heteroatoms can provide more **coordination sites**. The net effect depends on the balance between these factors.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **ketone groups within aliphatic chains** can result in **high yield** if other coordinating groups are present.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with **ketone (>C=O)** groups not adjacent to the carboxyl group and additional functional groups that facilitate coordination.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The ketone group may not interfere with coordination, and additional coordinating features can enhance catalyst activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by thoroughly analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures (functional groups) and considers their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: *Generalize SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups in Rules 2 and 3.*

  In the current code, the SMARTS patterns for Rules 2 and 3 are too specific, only matching nitro or bromomethyl groups for electron-withdrawing, and methyl or hydroxy groups for electron-donating. Modify the SMARTS patterns to capture a broader range of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups at the para position.

  - **For Rule 2**, use a general pattern for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs):
    ```
    ewg_para = 'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])c([*])c1'
    ```
    Then define a list of EWG SMARTS patterns and check if any match at the para position.

  - **For Rule 3**, similarly define a general pattern for electron-donating groups (EDGs) and use it to match various EDGs.

- **Suggestion 2**: *Modify SMARTS patterns in Rule 4 to capture all nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids.*

  The current pattern `[nH0][c][c][c][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` is too specific and may miss relevant structures. Use a more general SMARTS pattern that matches any nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring with a carboxylic acid group:
  ```
  heteroaromatic_nitrogen_carboxylic_acid = '[n,c]1[n,c][n,c][n,c][n,c][n,c]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```
  Adjust this pattern to include different heteroaromatic rings like pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, etc.

- **Suggestion 3**: *Expand the SMARTS pattern for Rule 5 to differentiate between aliphatic and aromatic thiol groups more effectively.*

  The patterns for thiol groups may not accurately distinguish between aliphatic and aromatic contexts. Refine the SMARTS patterns:
  - **For aliphatic thiols (High Yield)**:
    ```
    thiol_aliphatic = '[CX4][SX2H]'
    ```
  - **For aromatic thiols (Low Yield)**:
    ```
    thiol_aromatic = '[c][SX2H]'
    ```

- **Suggestion 4**: *Improve the pattern for Rule 6 to detect long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups.*

  The current pattern may not capture all long-chain aliphatic acids. Use a more general pattern:
  ```
  long_chain_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2]{4,}[CH3]'
  ```
  This pattern matches aliphatic chains with at least six carbons.

- **Suggestion 5**: *Revise the code to handle Rule 7's differentiation between nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains in amino acids.*

  The current patterns may not accurately identify the side chains. Update the patterns:
  - **For nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains (High Yield)**:
    ```
    amino_acid_n_aromatic = '[NX3H2][CX4H][CX3](=[OX1])[CX3][c,n]([n])[c,n]'
    ```
  - **For non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains (Low Yield)**:
    ```
    amino_acid_aromatic = '[NX3H2][CX4H][CX3](=[OX1])[CX3][c][c][c]'
    ```

- **Suggestion 6**: *Correct the SMARTS pattern for Rule 8 to match carboxylic acids with adjacent aldehyde or ketone groups.*

  The current pattern `[CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)` may not sufficiently capture the adjacency. Use:
  ```
  adjacent_carbonyl = '[CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)'
  ```
  Ensure that the two carbonyl groups are connected directly.

- **Suggestion 7**: *Enhance the patterns for Rules 9, 10, and 11 to improve detection of multiple ethers, heavily fluorinated chains, and acylated amino groups.*

  - **Rule 9 (Multiple Ethers)**:
    ```
    multiple_ethers = '[#6][OX2;!$(O=C)][#6][OX2;!$(O=C)][#6]'
    ```
  - **Rule 10 (Heavily Fluorinated Chains)**:
    ```
    fluorinated_chain = '[CX4]([F])([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])([F])'
    ```
    Consider matching any perfluorinated carbon chains.
  - **Rule 11 (Acylated Amino Groups)**:
    ```
    acylated_amino = '[NX3][CX3](=O)'
    ```

- **Suggestion 8**: *Add missing rules to the code, such as Rule 12 and Rule 14, to ensure coverage of all provided rules.*

  The current code skips some rules. Update the code to include all rules with appropriate patterns.

- **Suggestion 9**: *Implement functions to parse and interpret the natural language rules into SMARTS patterns more systematically.*

  This can be done by creating a mapping between functional groups described in the rules and their corresponding SMARTS patterns, ensuring consistency and completeness.

- **Suggestion 10**: *Perform validation checks using known examples and counter-examples for each rule to test the correctness of the SMARTS patterns.*

  For each rule, test the SMARTS patterns against molecules known to match or not match the rule to verify the accuracy before applying them to the dataset.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups (-COOH)**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids with an **amino group (-NH₂)**, a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** on the α-carbon, and an additional **carboxyl group** in the side chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple carboxyl groups act as **multidentate ligands**, enhancing coordination with the metal center. This strengthens the catalyst's stability and activity, leading to higher yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings bearing a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and an **electron-withdrawing group** at the para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the **acidity** of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center. This improved coordination strengthens the catalyst's effectiveness.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and an **electron-donating group** at the para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-donating groups decrease the **acidity** of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal center. This leads to reduced catalyst effectiveness and lower yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms**, such as **pyridinecarboxylic acids** and **pyrazolecarboxylic acids**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings containing **nitrogen atoms** (heteroatoms) and bearing a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms offer additional **coordination sites** for metal binding, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with thiol groups (-SH) on aliphatic chains** tend to result in **high yield**, while those with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a **thiol group (-SH)** on the side chain.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with a **thiol group (-SH)** attached directly to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Thiol groups on aliphatic chains can coordinate effectively without causing catalyst poisoning.
    - **Low Yield**: Thiol groups on aromatic rings may bind too strongly to the metal center, **blocking active sites** and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those with additional polar functional groups tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Straight-chain aliphatic acids containing only a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.
    - **Low Yield**: Aliphatic chains with additional **polar functional groups** like **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Minimal steric hindrance allows effective coordination with the metal center.
    - **Low Yield**: Additional polar groups introduce **steric hindrance** and competing interactions, hindering coordination and reducing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **Octanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains, such as **phenylalanine**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., indole ring).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **non-nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., benzene ring).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen atoms provide extra **coordination sites**, enhancing metal binding and catalyst activity.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of additional coordination sites results in weaker metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids possessing **carbonyl groups** near the **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Additional carbonyl groups may lead to **unwanted side reactions** or form **stable chelate rings** with the metal center, altering catalyst activity and decreasing yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages (-O-) or polyether chains** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids with one or more **ether bonds** in their structure, creating flexible, polar chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms may disrupt coordination between the carboxyl group and the metal center. Increased flexibility and polarity can reduce effective interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple **fluorine atoms** along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine increases the **acidity** but may also enhance **hydrophobicity** and decrease **solubility**. Altered electronic properties can disrupt effective coordination with the metal catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **blocked or acylated amino groups**, forming **amide linkages**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group is acylated or modified**, creating an **amide bond**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Blocking the amino group reduces available **coordination sites**, weakening metal-ligand interactions necessary for effective catalysis.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups at positions other than para**, or with multiple functional groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with **hydroxyl (-OH)** or other groups not optimally positioned for coordination.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Misplaced functional groups may cause **steric hindrance** or form **intramolecular hydrogen bonds**, interfering with metal coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains**, such as **sugar acids**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains with several **hydroxyl groups** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups offer additional **hydrogen bonding** and potential **coordination sites**, improving metal-ligand interactions and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents or multiple heteroatoms** may have varying effects on yield depending on their ability to coordinate effectively.

  - **Chemical Features**: Compounds with complex structures, including multiple rings or heteroatoms, and **carboxyl groups (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Bulky groups may introduce **steric hindrance**, but additional heteroatoms can provide more **coordination sites**. The net effect depends on the balance between these factors.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **ketone groups within aliphatic chains** can result in **high yield** if other coordinating groups are present.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with **ketone (>C=O)** groups not adjacent to the carboxyl group and additional functional groups that facilitate coordination.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The ketone group may not interfere with coordination, and additional coordinating features can enhance catalyst activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by thoroughly analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures (functional groups) and considers their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: *Broaden the SMARTS patterns for Rules 2 and 3 to capture any electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups at the para position, rather than specifying only nitro or bromomethyl (Rule 2) and methyl or hydroxy groups (Rule 3).* The current patterns are too specific and miss other relevant functional groups. For example, modify the SMARTS for Rule 2 to:
  
  ```python
  ewg_para_smarts = 'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])ccc1[A;$([F,Cl,Br,I,N+]=O,C#N,S(=O)(=O)[O-])]'
  ```
  
  This pattern includes common electron-withdrawing groups such as halogens, nitro, cyano, and sulfonyl groups at the para position. Similarly, adjust the SMARTS for Rule 3 to include a broader range of electron-donating groups:

  ```python
  edg_para_smarts = 'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])ccc1[A;$([O,N,S][H0,H1,H2])]'
  ```
  
  This pattern captures hydroxyl, amino, and thiol groups at the para position.

- **Suggestion 2**: *For Rules 2 and 3, implement positional specificity to ensure the substituents are indeed at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.* Use SMARTS that define the relative positions on the aromatic ring. For example, for para-substitution:
  
  ```python
  para_substituted_aromatic = '[c:1]1[cH,c:2][cH,c][cH,c][cH,c][c:3]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```
  
  Then, specify that substituent A is connected to carbon atom :3.

- **Suggestion 3**: *Refine the SMARTS patterns for heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen (Rule 4) to include common heteroaromatic systems.* The current pattern may be too restrictive. Adjust the pattern to:

  ```python
  heteroaromatic_nitrogen_carboxylic_acid_smarts = '[nX2][c][c][c]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[c][c]'
  ```
  
  This includes pyridinecarboxylic acids where the nitrogen atom is part of the ring.

- **Suggestion 4**: *For Rule 5, distinguish between thiol groups on aliphatic chains and those directly attached to aromatic rings using more precise SMARTS.* For thiols on aliphatic chains:

  ```python
  thiol_aliphatic_smarts = '[CX4][CH2][SX2H]'
  ```
  
  And for thiols attached to aromatic rings:

  ```python
  thiol_aromatic_smarts = 'c[SX2H]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 5**: *Modify the SMARTS for Rule 6 to accurately capture long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar functional groups.* The current pattern may miss shorter chains or include acids with functional groups. Use:

  ```python
  long_chain_acid_smarts = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2]{4,}[CH3]'
  polar_functional_groups_smarts = '[OX2H, NX3H2, SX2H, PX3H2]'
  ```
  
  Then exclude molecules that match `polar_functional_groups_smarts`.

- **Suggestion 6**: *Enhance the pattern for Rule 12 to avoid matching molecules with hydroxyl groups at the para position.* Use SMARTS that specify positions other than para. For meta positions, for example:

  ```python
  meta_hydroxyl_smarts = 'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])c(O)cc1'
  ```
  
  Adjust patterns accordingly to detect hydroxyl groups at ortho and meta positions.

- **Suggestion 7**: *For rules requiring count of certain functional groups (e.g., Rule 1 needing at least two carboxyl groups), ensure the code properly counts these groups.* Use RDKit's `GetSubstructMatches` method and verify the count meets the criteria:

  ```python
  carboxylic_acid_count = len(mol.GetSubstructMatches(carboxylic_acid_mol))
  if carboxylic_acid_count >= 2:
      # Proceed with rule application
  ```

- **Suggestion 8**: *Consider using more specific patterns for Rules involving complex structures (e.g., Rule 14 for bulky substituents or multiple heteroatoms).* Define what constitutes "bulky" or specify heteroatoms of interest, then create SMARTS that reflect these features.

- **Suggestion 9**: *Test and validate each SMARTS pattern individually on known compounds to ensure they match expected structures.* Use a set of test SMILES strings where the expected outcome is known, and adjust patterns based on the results.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups (-COOH)**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids with an **amino group (-NH₂)**, a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** on the α-carbon, and an additional **carboxyl group** in the side chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple carboxyl groups act as **multidentate ligands**, enhancing coordination with the metal center. This strengthens the catalyst's stability and activity, leading to higher yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings bearing a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and an **electron-withdrawing group** at the para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the **acidity** of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center. This improved coordination strengthens the catalyst's effectiveness.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **methyl (-CH₃)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and an **electron-donating group** at the para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Electron-donating groups decrease the **acidity** of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal center. This leads to reduced catalyst effectiveness and lower yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms**, such as **pyridinecarboxylic acids** and **pyrazolecarboxylic acids**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings containing **nitrogen atoms** (heteroatoms) and bearing a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms offer additional **coordination sites** for metal binding, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with thiol groups (-SH) on aliphatic chains** tend to result in **high yield**, while those with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a **thiol group (-SH)** on the side chain.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with a **thiol group (-SH)** attached directly to the aromatic ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Thiol groups on aliphatic chains can coordinate effectively without causing catalyst poisoning.
    - **Low Yield**: Thiol groups on aromatic rings may bind too strongly to the metal center, **blocking active sites** and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those with additional polar functional groups tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Straight-chain aliphatic acids containing only a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.
    - **Low Yield**: Aliphatic chains with additional **polar functional groups** like **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Minimal steric hindrance allows effective coordination with the metal center.
    - **Low Yield**: Additional polar groups introduce **steric hindrance** and competing interactions, hindering coordination and reducing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **Octanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains, such as **phenylalanine**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., indole ring).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **non-nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., benzene ring).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen atoms provide extra **coordination sites**, enhancing metal binding and catalyst activity.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of additional coordination sites results in weaker metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids possessing **carbonyl groups** near the **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Additional carbonyl groups may lead to **unwanted side reactions** or form **stable chelate rings** with the metal center, altering catalyst activity and decreasing yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages (-O-) or polyether chains** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Carboxylic acids with one or more **ether bonds** in their structure, creating flexible, polar chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms may disrupt coordination between the carboxyl group and the metal center. Increased flexibility and polarity can reduce effective interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple **fluorine atoms** along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine increases the **acidity** but may also enhance **hydrophobicity** and decrease **solubility**. Altered electronic properties can disrupt effective coordination with the metal catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **blocked or acylated amino groups**, forming **amide linkages**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group is acylated or modified**, creating an **amide bond**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Blocking the amino group reduces available **coordination sites**, weakening metal-ligand interactions necessary for effective catalysis.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups at positions other than para**, or with multiple functional groups, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with **hydroxyl (-OH)** or other groups not optimally positioned for coordination.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Misplaced functional groups may cause **steric hindrance** or form **intramolecular hydrogen bonds**, interfering with metal coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains**, such as **sugar acids**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains with several **hydroxyl groups** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups offer additional **hydrogen bonding** and potential **coordination sites**, improving metal-ligand interactions and stabilizing the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents or multiple heteroatoms** may have varying effects on yield depending on their ability to coordinate effectively.

  - **Chemical Features**: Compounds with complex structures, including multiple rings or heteroatoms, and **carboxyl groups (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Bulky groups may introduce **steric hindrance**, but additional heteroatoms can provide more **coordination sites**. The net effect depends on the balance between these factors.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **ketone groups within aliphatic chains** can result in **high yield** if other coordinating groups are present.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with **ketone (>C=O)** groups not adjacent to the carboxyl group and additional functional groups that facilitate coordination.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The ketone group may not interfere with coordination, and additional coordinating features can enhance catalyst activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by thoroughly analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures (functional groups) and considers their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct the SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing groups in Rule 2**. The current `ewg_list` in the code (`'[F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-],C#N,S(=O)(=O)[O-,OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`) is improperly formatted and may not capture the intended groups. To fix this, define each electron-withdrawing group separately with accurate SMARTS:

  - Nitro group: `'[N+](=O)[O-]'`
  - Cyano group: `C#N`
  - Halogens: `[F]`, `[Cl]`, `[Br]`, `[I]`
  - Sulfonyl group: `'S(=O)(=O)[O-,OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`

  Then, construct the SMARTS pattern for Rule 2 to match aromatic carboxylic acids with any of these groups at the para position:

  ```python
  ewg_smarts = '[N+](=O)[O-],C#N,[F],[Cl],[Br],[I],S(=O)(=O)[O-,OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ewg_para_smarts = f'c1ccc(cc1[CX3](=O)[O-,OX1H0-,OX2H1])[#6;$([#6][{ewg_smarts}])]'
  ewg_para_mol = Chem.MolFromSmarts(ewg_para_smarts)
  ```

  This ensures that the electron-withdrawing group is attached at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Revise the SMARTS patterns for electron-donating groups in Rule 3**. The current `edg_list` (`'[O,N,S][H0,H1,H2]'`) may not accurately represent all electron-donating groups and might not enforce the para position. Redefine the electron-donating groups and ensure they are at the para position:

  - Electron-donating groups: `[-OH]`, `[-OCH3]`, `[-NH2]`, `[-NHR]`, `[-NR2]`, `[-CH3]`
  - SMARTS:

    ```python
    edg_smarts = '[OH,NH2,NH(R),N(R)(R),CH3]'
    edg_para_smarts = f'c1ccc(cc1[CX3](=O)[O-,OX1H0-,OX2H1])[#6;$([#6][{edg_smarts}])]'
    edg_para_mol = Chem.MolFromSmarts(edg_para_smarts)
    ```

  Use accurate SMARTS for each group and ensure that the group is at the para position to the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Improve the SMARTS pattern for thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings in Rule 5.1**. The current SMARTS `'c[SX2H]'` may miss some valid cases. Update it to capture thiol groups attached to aromatic rings, regardless of ring position:

  ```python
  thiol_aromatic_smarts = 'c[SH]'
  thiol_aromatic_mol = Chem.MolFromSmarts(thiol_aromatic_smarts)
  ```

  Also, consider aromatic rings with thiol groups connected via a carbon (`-CH2SH`):

  ```python
  aromatic_thiol_smarts = 'c1ccc(cc1)[CX4][SX2H]'
  aromatic_thiol_mol = Chem.MolFromSmarts(aromatic_thiol_smarts)
  ```

- **Suggestion 4**: **Ensure the exclusion of polar functional groups in Rule 6 is correctly implemented**. The `polar_functional_groups_smarts` (`'[OX2H,NX3H2,SX2H,PX3H2]'`) may not cover all relevant polar groups. Expand this pattern to include other polar groups like hydroxyls, amines, amides, and ethers:

  ```python
  polar_functional_groups_smarts = '[OX2H,OX2H0][#6], [NX3H2,NX3H1][#6], [CX3](=O)[NX3], [CX3](=O)[OX2][#6]'
  polar_functional_groups_mol = Chem.MolFromSmarts(polar_functional_groups_smarts)
  ```

  Verify that molecules containing these groups are correctly excluded in the code logic.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns for Rule 12 to capture modifiers with hydroxyl groups at positions other than para or with multiple functional groups**. The current patterns may be too specific. Generalize the SMARTS to match any hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring not at the para position:

  ```python
  hydroxyl_non_para_smarts = 'c[c;!$(c[OH])][c][c][c][c][c][CX3](=O)[O-,OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  hydroxyl_non_para_mol = Chem.MolFromSmarts(hydroxyl_non_para_smarts)
  ```

  Additionally, include molecules with multiple substituents:

  ```python
  multiple_functional_groups_smarts = 'c1ccc(cc1[CX3](=O)[O-,OX1H0-,OX2H1])[!C;!H]'
  multiple_functional_groups_mol = Chem.MolFromSmarts(multiple_functional_groups_smarts)
  ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **For Rule 9, expand the SMARTS to capture longer polyether chains**. The current pattern `'[#6][OX2][#6][OX2][#6]'` may only match specific ethers. Modify the pattern to match polyethers of varying lengths:

  ```python
  polyether_smarts = '[#6]([OX2][#6]){2,}[OX2][#6]'
  polyether_mol = Chem.MolFromSmarts(polyether_smarts)
  ```

  This will match any chain with at least two ether linkages.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Verify and adjust the SMARTS patterns for multiple heteroatoms in Rule 14**. The current pattern `'[!#6;!#1][!#6;!#1]'` may not be sufficient. Redefine it to capture molecules with multiple heteroatoms in close proximity:

  ```python
  multiple_heteroatoms_smarts = '[#6][!#6;!#1][!#6;!#1][#6]'
  multiple_heteroatoms_mol = Chem.MolFromSmarts(multiple_heteroatoms_smarts)
  ```

- **Suggestion 8**: **Test each SMARTS pattern against known example compounds**. Use the examples provided in each rule to validate the SMARTS patterns. For instance, check that 4-nitrobenzoic acid matches the pattern for Rule 2 and that it results in a high yield. Adjust the patterns if the tests reveal mismatches.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Use RDKit's debugging tools to troubleshoot SMARTS patterns**. Utilize functions like `Chem.MolFromSmarts()` with error checking, and visualize substructure matches to ensure patterns are correctly identifying features in the molecules.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Consider combining multiple SMARTS patterns when necessary**. Some functional groups may require more complex patterns to be accurately detected. Use logical operators and recursive SMARTS if needed to capture the nuances of each rule.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**1. Comparison with Previous Metrics:**

**a. Support:**

- **Previous Train Support:** 
  - Minimum: **0.1667**
  - Maximum: **0.1845**
- **Current Train Support:** **0.0476**

**Observation:** The current support (4.76%) is significantly lower than the previous support range (16.67% to 18.45%). This indicates that the current set of rules covers a smaller portion of the training data compared to previous iterations.

---

**b. Confidence:**

- **Previous Train Confidence:** 
  - Minimum: **0.5396**
  - Maximum: **0.6352**
- **Current Train Confidence:** **0.6258**

**Observation:** The current confidence (62.58%) is close to the higher end of the previous confidence range. This suggests that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of correctly predicting the outcome remains similar to previous iterations.

---

**c. Lift:**

- **Previous Train Lift:** 
  - Minimum: **1.0559**
  - Maximum: **1.2048**
- **Current Train Lift:** **1.2513**

**Observation:** The current lift (1.2513) is slightly higher than the previous maximum lift. An increased lift indicates a stronger association between the rule conditions and the prediction compared to chance.

---

**d. Leverage:**

- **Previous Train Leverage:** 
  - Minimum: **-0.0041**
  - Maximum: **0.0289**
- **Current Train Leverage:** **0.0079**

**Observation:** The current leverage is positive but lower than the previous maximum. Positive leverage indicates a stronger association than expected by chance, but the decrease suggests a weaker improvement in rule significance.

---

**2. Analysis of the Current Metrics:**

**a. Support Decrease:**

- The significant drop in support from approximately 17% to 4.76% means the rules now apply to a much smaller subset of the data.
- While focused rules can be precise, excessively low support may limit the applicability and usefulness of the rules.

**b. Confidence Maintenance:**

- The confidence remains relatively stable compared to previous iterations, indicating that the precision of the rules has not markedly improved.
- High confidence with low support suggests the rules are accurate for a small group but may not generalize well.

**c. Lift Improvement:**

- The modest increase in lift from 1.2048 to 1.2513 shows a slight improvement in the effectiveness of the rules over random chance.
- However, the improvement is minimal, and the lift is still close to 1, indicating limited predictive power.

**d. Leverage Consideration:**

- The leverage value has decreased from the previous maximum, suggesting that the strength of association provided by the current rules is not as significant.
- A lower leverage value means the rule adds less new information beyond what is expected by chance.

---

**3. Determination of Local Minimum:**

- **Stagnation in Metrics Improvement:**
  - The current metrics show marginal or no significant improvement over previous iterations.
  - Confidence remains almost the same, and the lift has improved only slightly.
- **Low Support Concern:**
  - The decrease in support implies that further focusing on specificity may lead to overfitting.
- **Iteration Efficacy:**
  - Additional iterations using the same approach are unlikely to yield substantial improvements.
- **Conclusion:**
  - It appears a local minimum has been reached, where further refinements do not improve the model significantly.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

---

**1. **Increase Rule Support Without Sacrificing Confidence**

   **Action Steps:**

   - **Broaden Rule Conditions:**
     - Re-express rules to cover a wider range of data without losing predictive accuracy.
     - Identify common features among high-yield modifiers that are currently excluded.
   - **Combine Similar Rules:**
     - Merge overlapping rules to increase coverage and support.
   - **Example:**
     - If multiple rules apply to amino acids with specific side chains, consider a generalized rule encompassing all amino acids with coordinating side chains.

---

**2. **Enhance Confidence Through Refinement**

   **Action Steps:**

   - **Analyze Misclassifications:**
     - Investigate cases where the rules incorrectly predict yield to identify patterns.

     - Incorporate other relevant chemical properties, such as molecular weight, electronegativity, or steric factors.
   - **Adjust Rule Conditions:**
     - Fine-tune the specificity of functional groups or positions to improve accuracy.

---

**3. **Optimize Lift by Identifying Stronger Associations**

   **Action Steps:**

   - **Statistical Analysis:**
     - Use statistical methods (e.g., chi-square tests) to identify features with the strongest correlations to high yield.
   - **Feature Importance Ranking:**
     - Rank features based on their impact on the yield to prioritize in the rule conditions.
   - **Emphasize Key Functional Groups:**
     - Focus on chemical features that significantly increase the likelihood of high yields.

---

**4. **Balance Rule Complexity and Generalization**

   **Action Steps:**

   - **Avoid Overfitting:**
     - Ensure that rules are not overly specific to the training data at the expense of generalizability.
   - **Simplify Rules:**
     - Remove unnecessary conditions that do not contribute significantly to predictive power.
   - **Generalize Functional Groups:**
     - Use broader chemical classifications where appropriate (e.g., "electron-withdrawing groups" instead of specific substituents).

---

**5. **Incorporate Negative Examples in Rule Formation**

   **Action Steps:**

   - **Analyze Low Yield Modifiers:**
     - Study modifiers that consistently result in low yields to understand detrimental features.
   - **Introduce Exclusion Criteria:**
     - Add conditions to rules that exclude known negative features, improving overall accuracy.
   - **Example:**
     - "Modifiers are high yield unless they contain bulky groups that cause steric hindrance."

---

**6. **Engage in Feature Engineering**

   **Action Steps:**

   - **Create New Descriptors:**
     - Develop composite features that capture complex interactions (e.g., combining steric and electronic factors).
   - **Use Molecular Modeling:**
     - Employ computational chemistry tools to predict interaction strengths and include them in the rules.
   - **Consider 3D Structures:**
     - Incorporate spatial information about molecules that may affect catalyst interactions.

---

   - **Pattern Recognition:**
     - Apply clustering algorithms to group modifiers with similar yields and identify underlying features.
   - **Model Validation:**
     - Use cross-validation techniques to test model performance and prevent overfitting.

---

**8. **Consult Domain Experts for Insights**

   **Action Steps:**

   - **Expert Review:**
     - Have chemists or catalysis experts evaluate the current rules for plausibility and potential missing factors.
   - **Incorporate Practical Considerations:**
     - Include real-world factors such as modifier availability, cost, and stability.
   - **Iterative Feedback:**
     - Use expert feedback to refine rules iteratively.

---

**9. **Explore Alternative Data Representations**

   **Action Steps:**

   - **Use Fingerprints or Descriptors:**
     - Represent molecules using chemical fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys) to capture structural features quantitatively.
   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
     - Reduce dimensionality and identify principal features influencing the yield.
   - **Data Augmentation:**
     - Increase the dataset by including similar reactions or modifiers to enhance model robustness.

---

**10. **Re-assess the Dataset Quality**

   **Action Steps:**

   - **Check for Data Imbalance:**
     - Ensure that the dataset has a balanced representation of high and low yields.
   - **Data Cleaning:**
     - Remove or correct erroneous data points that may skew the results.
   - **Expand the Dataset:**
     - Include additional experimental data if available to improve statistical significance.

---

**Summary**

- The current rules show minimal improvement over previous iterations, with a slight increase in lift but a significant decrease in support.
- The low support indicates that the rules are too specific and do not capture enough of the dataset to be broadly useful.
- To improve the current rules:
  - **Increase support** by broadening the applicability of the rules.
  - **Enhance confidence and lift** by refining conditions and focusing on features with strong associations to yield.
  - **Balance rule complexity** to avoid overfitting and improve generalizability.
- **Further iterations using the same approach are unlikely to yield significant improvements**, suggesting a need for a change in strategy.
- **Implementing the recommended actions** can help develop more robust, accurate, and generalizable rules, ultimately leading to better performance in predicting reaction yields.

---

By addressing these areas, the current rules can be improved to provide more valuable insights into the catalytic problem, enhancing both predictive accuracy and practical applicability.

**Performance Analysis of Current Rules**

1. **Effectiveness Evaluation**:
   - **Validation Accuracy**: The current 5-fold validation accuracy is **0.6**, which is lower than previous iterations where validation accuracies ranged from **0.76** to **0.742**.
   - **Test Accuracy**: Previous test accuracies were **0.75** and **0.625**, indicating that the current model's predictive performance has decreased.
   - **Conclusion**: The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be as effective in capturing the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment**:
   - The consistent decline in validation accuracy across iterations indicates potential **underfitting**. The model may not be capturing the complexity of the data sufficiently.
   - The variability in predictions for certain molecules suggests that the model's generalization capability is limited.

3. **Discrepancy Analysis Using SHAP Values**:
   - **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low)**:
     - Molecules such as **C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N** and **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O** are predicted to have high loading but experimentally have low loading.
     - **Rule14** consistently shows high positive SHAP values (**0.07738**), indicating it heavily influences the overestimation.
   - **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High)**:
     - Molecules such as **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O** and **C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)** sometimes have predictions of low loading when experimentally they have high loading.
     - In iterations where these underestimations occur, rules like **Rule11** and **Rule12** exhibit high negative SHAP values, suggesting they contribute to the underestimation.

4. **Accuracy Metrics Interpretation**:
   - The decreased accuracy metrics suggest that the current rules may not be improving the model's predictive power.
   - Plateaus or declines in accuracy indicate that a local minimum may have been reached, and further iterations without changes are unlikely to yield better performance.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis**:
   - **Rule14**: Frequently associated with high positive SHAP values in overestimated loadings, indicating it may be too broadly defined or misrepresentative.
   - **Rule11** and **Rule12**: Contribute significant negative SHAP values in underestimated loadings, suggesting they may be overly penalizing certain molecular features.
   - The SHAP values highlight specific rules that disproportionately affect the predictions, pointing to areas where rule refinement is necessary.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values in Overestimations**:
   - **Rule14 (Modifiers with bulky substituents or multiple heteroatoms)**:
     - **Issue**: Overestimation of loading for molecules where bulky substituents might actually hinder coordination due to steric hindrance.
     - **Recommendation**: Split **Rule14** into two distinct rules:
       - **Rule14a**: Modifiers with bulky substituents that provide beneficial coordination should be specified with clear structural criteria.
       - **Rule14b**: Modifiers where bulky groups cause steric hindrance should be associated with low yield.
     - **Action**: Redefine the rule to account for the balance between steric hindrance and beneficial coordination.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations**:
   - **Rule11 (Modifiers with blocked or acylated amino groups forming amide linkages)**:
     - **Issue**: May be overly penalizing molecules where amide linkages do not significantly impede coordination.
     - **Recommendation**: Modify **Rule11** to consider the context of the amide group within the molecule. If the amide is part of a structure that still allows for effective coordination, it should not contribute to a low yield prediction.
     - **Action**: Incorporate sub-rules or exceptions where amide-containing modifiers have proven effective.
   - **Rule12 (Aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups at non-para positions)**:
     - **Issue**: Could be underestimating molecules where hydroxyl positioning does not hinder and might even enhance coordination.
     - **Recommendation**: Re-express **Rule12** to include considerations for ortho and meta hydroxyl groups that may participate in chelation.
     - **Action**: Update the rule to reflect the potential positive impact of hydroxyl groups in certain positions.

3. **Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting**:
   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**:
     - Excessively specific rules may not generalize well. Simplify rules where possible to broaden their applicability without sacrificing accuracy.
   - **Incorporate Additional Data**:
     - Include more molecular descriptors or features in the model to capture aspects not currently considered.
   - **Balance Rule Coverage**:
     - Ensure that rules are not biased toward a subset of molecules. Adjust rules so that they evenly cover the diversity in the dataset.

4. **Use Insights from SHAP Analysis for Iterative Refinement**:
   - **Identify Impactful Features**:
     - Use SHAP values to determine which molecular features significantly influence predictions.
   - **Iteratively Test Rule Modifications**:
     - After adjusting rules, reassess their impact on model performance and SHAP values to ensure improvements.
   - **Monitor Changes in Accuracy Metrics**:
     - Track how adjustments affect validation and test accuracies to avoid overfitting and to strive for optimal predictive power.

5. **Additional Suggestions**:
   - **Re-Evaluate Rule6 and Rule7**:
     - Given their frequent appearance in SHAP analyses, these rules may also benefit from refinement to improve accuracy.
   - **Consider Interactive Effects**:
     - Some modifiers might have features that interact in ways not captured by the current rules. Explore rules that account for such interactions.
   - **Expand the Dataset**:
     - If possible, include more data points to provide a better foundation for rule development and to improve model training.

By thoughtfully refining the rules based on these recommendations, the model's performance can be improved, leading to more accurate predictions and a deeper understanding of the factors influencing catalyst loading and reaction yield.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The recent analysis of the reaction data, performance metrics, and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values has highlighted areas where the current rules governing the catalytic action of modified catalysts can be improved. The goal is to enhance the predictive accuracy of the rules, increase their applicability (support), and ensure they generalize well without overfitting the data.

---

**Key Findings from the Analysis:**

1. **Rule Metrics Indicate Low Support and Stagnant Improvement:**
   - The **current rules have low support** (approximately 4.76%), meaning they apply to a small subset of the data.
   - **Confidence** remains stable, but the marginal **increase in lift** suggests limited improvement over random chance.
   - **Leverage values** indicate the rules are not adding significant new information.

2. **Accuracy and SHAP Analysis Reveal Predictive Limitations:**
   - **Validation accuracy has decreased** to 60%, suggesting potential underfitting.
   - **SHAP values** identify certain rules that disproportionately influence predictions, leading to misclassifications.
     - **Rule14** often contributes to overestimations (predicting high yield when the experimental value is low).
     - **Rule11** and **Rule12** contribute to underestimations (predicting low yield when the experimental value is high).

3. **Current Rules May Be Overly Specific or Incorrectly Implemented:**
   - Misalignment between SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification) patterns and intended chemical features reduces rule effectiveness.
   - Some rules do not accurately capture the chemical behavior due to improperly defined functional groups or positions.

---

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Correct and Refine SMARTS Patterns:**
   - **Rule 2 (Electron-Withdrawing Groups):**
     - Update SMARTS patterns to accurately represent electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position.
     - Use precise SMARTS for groups like nitro (`[N+](=O)[O-]`), cyano (`C#N`), and halogens (`[F]`, `[Cl]`, `[Br]`, `[I]`).

   - **Rule 3 (Electron-Donating Groups):**
     - Revise SMARTS patterns to correctly identify electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position.
     - Include groups like hydroxyl (`-OH`), amino (`-NH2`), and methyl (`-CH3`).

   - **Rule 5 (Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings):**
     - Improve the pattern to capture thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings, such as using `c[SH]`.

   - **Rule 6 (Exclusion of Polar Functional Groups):**
     - Expand SMARTS patterns to include all relevant polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, amines, amides, ethers).
     - Ensure that molecules with these groups are correctly identified and excluded when necessary.

   - **Rule 9 (Polyether Chains):**
     - Adjust the pattern to detect longer polyether chains by using quantifiers that allow variable lengths (e.g., repetitions of ether units).

   - **Rule 12 (Hydroxyl Groups and Multiple Functional Groups):**
     - Refine patterns to capture modifiers with hydroxyl groups at positions other than para on aromatic rings.
     - Include patterns for molecules with multiple substituents that may interfere with coordination.

   - **Rule 14 (Modifiers with Multiple Heteroatoms):**
     - Verify and adjust patterns to accurately identify molecules with multiple heteroatoms, considering their relative positions and potential interactions.

2. **Validate Rules with Known Examples:**
   - Test each SMARTS pattern against the example compounds provided in the rules.
   - Ensure that high-yield modifiers match the patterns intended to identify them.
   - Adjust patterns based on discrepancies found during testing.

3. **Refine Problematic Rules Based on SHAP Analysis:**
   - **Rule14:**
     - Split into separate rules to distinguish between beneficial bulky substituents and those causing steric hindrance.
     - Clearly define structural criteria that favor coordination versus those that impede it.

   - **Rule11 and Rule12:**
     - Modify to consider cases where blocked amino groups or hydroxyl positioning do not significantly hinder coordination.
     - Incorporate exceptions or additional conditions to improve predictive accuracy.

4. **Increase Rule Support Without Sacrificing Accuracy:**
   - Generalize rules to cover a broader range of modifiers while maintaining high confidence.
   - Combine overlapping rules to improve dataset coverage and reduce redundancy.
   - Avoid overly specific conditions that limit applicability.

5. **Enhance Model Generalization and Prevent Underfitting:**
   - Introduce additional molecular descriptors or features that capture essential chemical properties.
   - Utilize statistical methods to identify features with strong correlations to yield.
   - Apply machine learning techniques to uncover non-linear relationships and interactions between features.

6. **Iteratively Test and Refine Rules:**
   - Continuously assess the impact of rule modifications on performance metrics.
   - Use cross-validation to evaluate the model's predictive power and prevent overfitting.
   - Monitor changes in validation accuracy, support, confidence, and lift after each iteration.

7. **Engage Domain Expertise:**
   - Consult with chemists or catalysis experts to review the rules for chemical plausibility.
   - Incorporate practical considerations such as steric effects, electronic properties, and potential side reactions.
   - Use expert feedback to guide rule refinement and validation.

8. **Utilize RDKit Debugging and Visualization Tools:**
   - Employ RDKit functions to troubleshoot and visualize SMARTS pattern matches.
   - Confirm that patterns correctly identify the intended molecular features within the dataset.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining SMARTS patterns, adjusting rules based on SHAP analysis, and ensuring that the rules accurately reflect the underlying chemical principles, we can enhance both the coverage and predictive accuracy of the model. Implementing these suggestions will likely lead to improved performance metrics and a more robust understanding of the factors influencing reaction yield.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by thoroughly analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures (functional groups) and considers their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules facilitates a deeper understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance in this chemical transformation.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Rule 2 (Electron-Withdrawing Groups at Para Position)**

  - **Issue**: The existing SMARTS patterns may not accurately capture all electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position, reducing the rule's effectiveness.

  - **Recommendation**: Update the SMARTS patterns to precisely represent EWGs at the **para** position on aromatic carboxylic acids.

  - **Action Steps**:
    - **Use Specific SMARTS for Common EWGs**:
      - **Nitro Group**: `[cH]c([cH])c([cH])c([cH])[N+](=O)[O-]` ensures the nitro group is at the para position.
      - **Cyano Group**: `[cH]c([cH])c([cH])c([cH])C#N` for para-cyano substitution.
      - **Halogens**: `[cH]c([cH])c([cH])c([cH])[F,Cl,Br,I]` to cover all halogens at the para position.
    - **Generalize with a Variable EWG**:
      - Use `[cH]c([cH])c([cH])c([cH])[EWG]` where `[EWG]` is a wildcard for electron-withdrawing groups.
      - Define `[EWG]` as `[N+](=O)[O-]`, `C#N`, `[F,Cl,Br,I]`, `C(=O)R`, etc.
    - **Ensure Carboxylic Acid Functionality**:
      - Combine with carboxylic acid SMARTS: `c1cc([EWG])ccc1C(=O)[O-]`

- **Advice 2**: **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Rule 3 (Electron-Donating Groups at Para Position)**

  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS patterns may not accurately identify electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position, affecting the rule's precision.

  - **Recommendation**: Update the SMARTS patterns to correctly identify EDGs at the **para** position on aromatic carboxylic acids.

  - **Action Steps**:
    - **Use Specific SMARTS for Common EDGs**:
      - **Hydroxyl Group**: `[cH]c([cH])c([cH])c([cH])O` for para-hydroxy substitution.
      - **Amino Group**: `[cH]c([cH])c([cH])c([cH])[NH2]` for para-amino substitution.
      - **Methoxy Group**: `[cH]c([cH])c([cH])c([cH])OC` for para-methoxy substitution.
      - **Methyl Group**: `[cH]c([cH])c([cH])c([cH])C` for para-methyl substitution.
    - **Ensure Carboxylic Acid Functionality**:
      - Combine with carboxylic acid SMARTS: `c1cc([EDG])ccc1C(=O)[O-]`

- **Advice 3**: **Improve Rule 5 SMARTS Patterns for Thiol Groups**

  - **Issue**: The rule may not accurately distinguish between thiol groups on aliphatic chains and those attached to aromatic rings.

  - **Recommendation**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to accurately capture thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings versus aliphatic chains.

  - **Action Steps**:
    - **For Thiol on Aromatic Rings (Low Yield)**:
      - Use SMARTS: `c[SH]` to identify thiol groups directly attached to aromatic carbons.
    - **For Thiol on Aliphatic Chains (High Yield)**:
      - Use SMARTS: `C[SH]` where `C` is an aliphatic (sp³-hybridized) carbon.
    - **Adjust Rule Classification**:
      - Ensure that modifiers matching `c[SH]` are associated with **low yield**, and those matching `C[SH]` are associated with **high yield**.

- **Advice 4**: **Expand Rule 6 SMARTS Patterns to Include All Relevant Polar Functional Groups**

  - **Issue**: Rule 6 may not be sufficiently comprehensive in identifying aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional polar functional groups.

  - **Recommendation**: Expand the SMARTS patterns to include hydroxyls, amines, amides, ethers, and other polar groups along the aliphatic chain.

  - **Action Steps**:
    - **Define Polar Functional Groups**:
      - Use `[OH]`, `[NH2]`, `[NHR]`, `[NR2]`, `[OC]` to represent hydroxyl, primary/secondary/tertiary amines, and ethers.
    - **SMARTS Pattern for Exclusion (Low Yield)**:
      - `C(=O)[O-][CX4][*][$(O),$(N),$(NC=O),$(OC)]` to identify aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents.
    - **SMARTS Pattern for Inclusion (High Yield)**:
      - `C(=O)[O-][CX4]` with no attached polar groups.
    - **Update Rule**:
      - Modifiers matching the exclusion pattern are predicted to have **low yield**.
      - Modifiers matching the inclusion pattern (without polar groups) are predicted to have **high yield**.

- **Advice 5**: **Adjust Rule 9 SMARTS Patterns for Polyether Chains**

  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS patterns may not detect modifiers with longer polyether chains effectively.

  - **Recommendation**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to recognize variable lengths of polyether chains using quantifiers.

  - **Action Steps**:
    - **Define Polyether Chain Pattern**:
      - Use `(OCC)n` where `n` is a variable representing two or more repeats.
    - **SMARTS Pattern for Polyether Chains**:
      - `[OX2;$([OX2][CX4][CX4][OX2])]` to match ether linkages.
      - Use quantifiers: `[OX2;$([OX2][CX4][CX4][OX2])]{2,}` to match two or more ether units.
    - **Update Rule**:
      - Modifiers containing patterns matching the polyether chains are associated with **low yield**.

- **Advice 6**: **Refine Rule 12 SMARTS Patterns for Hydroxyl Groups and Multiple Functional Groups**

  - **Issue**: Rule 12 may not accurately capture modifiers with hydroxyl groups at positions other than para or those with multiple interfering substitutions.

  - **Recommendation**: Update the SMARTS patterns to correctly identify such modifiers.

  - **Action Steps**:
    - **Hydroxyl Groups at Ortho or Meta Positions**:
      - Use SMARTS: `c1cc(O)ccc1C(=O)[O-]` for ortho-hydroxybenzoic acid, and adjust for meta position accordingly.
    - **Multiple Substituents on Aromatic Rings**:
      - Use SMARTS patterns that allow for multiple substituents: `c1c([OX2H])c([R])ccc1C(=O)[O-]`
      - `[R]` represents any substituent, ensuring molecules with additional groups are captured.
    - **Update Rule Classification**:
      - Modifiers matching these patterns are predicted to have **low yield** due to steric hindrance or interfering interactions.

- **Advice 7**: **Modify Rule 14 to Better Distinguish Bulky Substituents**

  - **Issue**: Rule 14 may be too broad, leading to misclassifications due to bulky substituents causing either beneficial or detrimental effects.

  - **Recommendation**: Split Rule 14 into separate rules to distinguish between bulky groups that enhance coordination and those that cause steric hindrance.

  - **Action Steps**:
    - **Rule for Bulky Substituents Enhancing Coordination (High Yield)**:
      - Identify modifiers with bulky groups that include additional heteroatoms capable of coordination.
      - Example SMARTS: `[c,n,o]1[c,n,o][c,n,o][c,n,o][c,n,o]1C(=O)[O-]` for multi-heteroatom rings.
    - **Rule for Bulky Substituents Causing Steric Hindrance (Low Yield)**:
      - Identify modifiers with bulky alkyl or aryl groups without additional coordination sites.
      - Example SMARTS: `C(=O)[O-][C](C)(C)[C]` for t-butyl groups adjacent to carboxylate.
    - **Update Rule Classification**:
      - Modifiers matching the first pattern are associated with **high yield**.
      - Modifiers matching the second pattern are associated with **low yield**.

- **Advice 8**: **Adjust Rules 11 and 12 Based on SHAP Analysis**

  - **Issue**: SHAP analysis shows that Rules 11 and 12 contribute to misclassification.

  - **Recommendation**: Modify these rules to account for exceptions where blocked amino groups or hydroxyl positioning do not significantly hinder coordination.

  - **Action Steps**:
    - **For Rule 11 (Blocked Amino Groups)**:
      - Refine the SMARTS pattern to exclude cases where the amide linkage still allows for effective coordination.
      - Example: Only classify as **low yield** if the amino group is acylated and no other coordination sites are present.
    - **For Rule 12 (Hydroxyl Groups and Multiple Substituents)**:
      - Consider the electronic effects and positions of substituents.
      - Incorporate exceptions for molecules where the hydroxyl group may facilitate coordination despite its position.

- **Advice 9**: **Increase Rule Support by Generalizing Rules**

  - **Issue**: The current rules have low support, applying to a small subset of the data.

  - **Recommendation**: Generalize existing rules where feasible to cover a broader range of modifiers without sacrificing accuracy.

  - **Action Steps**:
    - **Combine Overlapping Rules**:
      - Identify rules that capture similar features (e.g., Rules 2 and 4 regarding electron-withdrawing substituents).
      - Create a generalized rule for aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents that enhance coordination.
    - **Simplify Specific Conditions**:
      - Remove overly specific constraints that limit applicability.
      - Focus on core functional groups that are most predictive of yield outcome.

- **Advice 10**: **Use RDKit Tools to Test and Refine SMARTS Patterns**

  - **Issue**: Incorrect or improperly defined SMARTS patterns reduce rule effectiveness.

  - **Recommendation**: Utilize RDKit functions to visualize and test the SMARTS patterns against known molecules.

  - **Action Steps**:
    - **Test SMARTS Patterns**:
      - For each rule, use `Chem.MolFromSmiles()` to generate molecule objects.
      - Use `Chem.MolFromSmarts()` to define the SMARTS pattern.
      - Employ `mol.HasSubstructMatch(smarts)` to test if the molecule matches the pattern.
    - **Visualize Matches**:
      - Use `Draw.MolToImage()` to visualize the molecule and highlight matched substructures.
    - **Refine Patterns**:
      - Adjust SMARTS patterns if they fail to match the intended molecules or incorrectly match others.

- **Advice 11**: **Validate Rules with Known Examples**

  - **Issue**: Ensuring that the rules correctly classify known modifiers is essential for their validity.

  - **Recommendation**: Test each rule against the provided examples to ensure that high-yield modifiers match the patterns intended to identify them.

  - **Action Steps**:
    - **Compile Known Modifiers**:
      - Create a list of modifiers with their experimental yields.
    - **Apply Rules**:
      - Use the refined SMARTS patterns to classify each modifier according to the rules.
    - **Compare Predictions with Experimental Data**:
      - Check for discrepancies between predicted and actual yields.
    - **Adjust Rules Accordingly**:
      - Modify rules where misclassifications occur to improve accuracy.

- **Advice 12**: **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors**

  - **Issue**: The current rules may not capture all relevant factors influencing yield.

  - **Recommendation**: Introduce additional molecular descriptors or features to improve predictive accuracy.

  - **Action Steps**:
    - **Identify Key Descriptors**:
      - Calculate descriptors such as LogP (hydrophobicity), molecular weight, and topological polar surface area (TPSA).
    - **Analyze Correlations**:
      - Use statistical methods to determine if these descriptors correlate with reaction yield.
    - **Integrate into Rules**:
      - If strong correlations are found, include thresholds or conditions based on these descriptors in the rules.

- **Advice 13**: **Iteratively Test and Refine Rules**

  - **Issue**: Continuous improvement of rules is necessary to enhance model performance.

  - **Recommendation**: After implementing changes to the rules, iteratively test their impact on performance metrics and refine further as needed.

  - **Action Steps**:
    - **Re-Evaluate Performance Metrics**:
      - Assess support, confidence, lift, and validation accuracy after each refinement.
    - **Conduct Cross-Validation**:
      - Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to test the rules on different subsets of data.
    - **Monitor SHAP Values**:
      - Analyze how changes affect the SHAP values and the contribution of each rule.
    - **Refine as Necessary**:
      - Continue to adjust the rules based on the observed performance until satisfactory metrics are achieved.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying consistent patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures (functional groups) and incorporates underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** for any given structure that fits the descriptions. This systematic approach facilitates the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with higher coverage generalize predictions effectively, whereas more complex rules capture specific nuances that significantly impact the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules enhances understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance, aiding in the advancement of this chemical transformation.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Descriptors into Quantitative Molecular Descriptors**

  Convert the qualitative features in the current rules into quantitative molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. Utilize cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit) to compute descriptors such as:

  - **Functional Group Counts**: Number of specific functional groups (e.g., -COOH, -NH₂, -OH, aromatic rings).
  - **Electronic Descriptors**: Hammett sigma constants, electronegativity values, or partial charges to quantify electron-donating or withdrawing effects.
  - **Topological Descriptors**: Molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of rotatable bonds, and molecular connectivity indices.

  By quantifying these features, you can generate a numerical feature matrix suitable for statistical analysis and machine learning models.

- **Advice 2**: **Develop SMARTS Patterns for Key Substructures**

  Create a set of SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns corresponding to the critical functional groups and substructures identified in the current rules. This allows for automated matching and counting of these features in any given SMILES string.

  - **Example**: Define SMARTS patterns for carboxyl groups (`[#6][C](=O)[O-]`), amino groups (`[NX3;H2,H1;!$(NC=O)]`), aromatic rings (`a`), electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro group `[NX3](=O)=O`).

  Implementing these patterns enables the extraction of binary (presence/absence) or count-based features for each molecule.

- **Advice 3**: **Simplify and Generalize the Rules**

  Revise the rules to reduce complexity and improve generalizability:

  - **Merge Similar Rules**: Combine rules that share underlying physical-chemical principles. For instance, unify rules concerning electron-withdrawing groups into a single rule with quantifiable parameters.
  - **Use Quantitative Thresholds**: Instead of categorical descriptors (e.g., "long-chain"), specify quantitative thresholds (e.g., "aliphatic chains with 6 or more carbon atoms").

  Simplifying the rules makes them more amenable to numerical representation and reduces redundancy.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors Related to Metal Coordination**

  Focus on descriptors that directly impact metal-ligand interactions:

  - **Ligand Denticity**: Calculate the number of potential coordination sites in each modifier molecule.
  - **Chelation Indices**: Evaluate the molecule's ability to form chelate rings with metal centers.
  - **Donor-Acceptor Properties**: Assess donor numbers and acceptor numbers to quantify coordination strength.

  These descriptors provide a direct link between molecular structure and catalytic activity, facilitating more accurate predictions.

- **Advice 5**: **Use Statistical Analysis to Identify Key Features**

  Perform statistical analyses (e.g., regression, principal component analysis) on the numerical data to identify which descriptors significantly correlate with reaction yield:

  - **Feature Selection**: Determine the most influential features affecting yield.
  - **Model Building**: Develop predictive models that relate molecular descriptors to yield outcomes.

  This data-driven approach can reveal insights that inform the refinement of the rules.

- **Advice 6**: **Implement Machine Learning Models for Prediction**

  Utilize machine learning algorithms to complement the rule-based approach:

  - **Algorithm Selection**: Choose suitable models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, support vector machines) that handle quantitative data effectively.
  - **Model Training**: Train models on the numerical feature matrix and yield data to predict outcomes for new modifiers.
  - **Model Interpretation**: Analyze the trained models to extract human-interpretable rules and patterns.

  Machine learning models can capture complex nonlinear relationships that may be difficult to encode in manual rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Standardize Data Representation**

  Ensure that all molecular modifiers are represented consistently:

  - **Canonical SMILES**: Use canonical SMILES strings to avoid duplication.
  - **Normalization**: Normalize descriptor values to a common scale for comparability.
  - **Data Quality Checks**: Validate the accuracy of the computed descriptors and address any anomalies.

  A standardized dataset facilitates reliable feature extraction and analysis.

- **Advice 8**: **Feedback Loop for Rule Refinement**

  Establish a feedback mechanism where insights from numerical analyses inform the refinement of the rules:

  - **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously update the rules based on new data and findings.
  - **Cross-Validation**: Test the revised rules against experimental results to assess their predictive power.
  - **Collaborative Review**: Involve domain experts to interpret statistical findings in the context of chemical knowledge.

  This iterative process enhances the robustness and applicability of the rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Document Assumptions and Limitations**

  Clearly document any assumptions made during descriptor calculation and rule formulation:

  - **Assumptions**: Specify any default values or estimation methods used.
  - **Limitations**: Acknowledge the limitations of the descriptors and models employed.

  Transparency in documentation aids in understanding the scope and context of the rules.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify Rules Using Quantifiable Structural Features**  
  Revise the existing rules to focus on specific, quantifiable structural features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For example, instead of complex descriptions, specify the presence or count of functional groups like carboxyl groups (-COOH), amino groups (-NH₂), and hydroxyl groups (-OH). This simplification will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix by making it easier to encode molecular features numerically.

- **Advice 2**: **Define Clear Binary or Count-Based Descriptors**  
  For each rule, define descriptors that can be represented as binary (presence/absence) or count-based features. For instance, create features like "Number of carboxyl groups," "Contains aromatic ring (Yes/No)," or "Number of nitrogen atoms in heterocycles." This approach allows for straightforward transformation of molecular structures into numeric data suitable for statistical analysis or machine learning models.

- **Advice 3**: **Utilize Molecular Fingerprints and SMARTS Patterns**  
  Incorporate molecular fingerprints (e.g., ECFP, MACCS keys) and SMARTS patterns to represent molecular substructures numerically. Rewrite the rules to include specific SMARTS patterns that correspond to the functional groups or substructures of interest. This strategy enables automated detection of structural features from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools like RDKit.

- **Advice 4**: **Include Physicochemical Property Descriptors**  
  Augment the rules with descriptors based on physicochemical properties that can be calculated computationally, such as pKa, logP (partition coefficient), molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor counts. These properties can provide valuable numerical data correlating with reaction yields and can be generated directly from SMILES strings.

- **Advice 5**: **Create a Standardized Feature Extraction Protocol**  
  Establish a consistent protocol for feature extraction from SMILES strings, detailing the exact features to be calculated for each molecule. This protocol should align with the revised rules and ensure that all relevant molecular features are captured numerically. Providing a standardized method ensures reproducibility and reliability in the data analysis process.

- **Advice 6**: **Merge Similar Rules to Reduce Complexity**  
  Assess the current rules for overlap and combine similar ones to reduce redundancy and complexity. For example, rules dealing with electron-withdrawing groups can be merged, specifying a unified approach to how these groups influence yield. Simplifying the rule set makes it easier to create a manageable number of descriptors for the feature matrix.

- **Advice 7**: **Prioritize Features with Strong Correlation to Yield**  
  Identify and prioritize structural features that show a strong statistical correlation with the reaction yield based on the dataset. Focus on these features when generating the numeric feature matrix to enhance the predictive power of any subsequent data analysis or modeling efforts.

- **Advice 8**: **Provide Examples with Feature Annotations**  
  For clarity, include annotated examples of molecules from the dataset, illustrating how each feature is extracted and represented numerically. This guidance will help ensure that the feature extraction process is correctly implemented and that the numeric feature matrix accurately reflects the molecular structures.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Hierarchical Classification of Functional Groups**  
  Implement a hierarchical approach to classify functional groups based on their electronic and steric properties. For instance, group electron-withdrawing groups by their strength and represent them numerically according to their classification. This method adds nuance to the feature matrix without overcomplicating it.

- **Advice 10**: **Use Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Modeling**  
  Integrate QSAR modeling techniques to relate molecular descriptors quantitatively with reaction yields. By defining rules in terms of QSAR descriptors, the numerical feature matrix becomes directly applicable to predictive modeling and can uncover deeper relationships between molecular structure and catalytic performance.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 clearly defines long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups along the chain as resulting in low yield, supported by physical-chemical insight about steric hindrance and competing coordination. The rule combines multiple substructures and is well-supported by multiple data points (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), providing strong coverage.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 distinguishes between α-amino acids with nitrogenous aromatic side chains (resulting in high yield) and those with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains (resulting in low yield).

- **Comment 14**:

  Rule 14 indicates that dicarboxylic acids with internal ketone groups result in low yield due to unfavorable interactions affecting metal coordination. The rule is clear and offers appropriate insight but is supported by only one data point (4-oxoheptanedioic acid), which limits its coverage.

- **Comment 15**:

  Rule 15 suggests that aromatic carboxylic acids with extended conjugation or multiple aromatic rings linked via aliphatic chains result in high yield due to enhanced electron delocalization. While the rule has sound physical-chemical reasoning and complexity, the clarity could be improved to specify the required structural features more precisely. Coverage is generally good but may be compromised by contradictory data (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid shows low yield), indicating that additional factors may influence the outcome.

It considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by multiple data points (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), enhancing its coverage. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear with plausible reasoning about thiol groups on aromatic rings reducing catalytic activity. It considers specific sub-structures but has limited coverage with only one data point (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid). Additional supporting examples would improve the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and offers acceptable physical-chemical insight. It considers specific combinations of sub-structures but has limited coverage with only one data point (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid). The rule would benefit from more data points to enhance coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear, provides strong physical-chemical insight, and considers combinations of sub-structures (aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles). It is supported by multiple data points (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid), resulting in excellent coverage and making it one of the strongest rules.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear with plausible reasoning about multiple hydroxyl groups enhancing catalyst stability. It considers complex sub-structures but has limited coverage with only one data point (gluconic acid). More examples are needed to improve coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides acceptable physical-chemical insight about heavily fluorinated acids reducing yield. It considers specific chemical features but has limited coverage with only one data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). Additional data would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear, offers good physical-chemical insight, and considers specific modifications (acylated amino groups). It is supported by two data points (acetylated amino acids), providing decent coverage. The rule is solid and well-balanced.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 lacks clarity due to its variable outcome and has limited coverage with only one data point (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid). The physical-chemical insight is somewhat plausible but not strongly supported. The rule needs refinement and more supporting data to be reliable.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains, like **phenylalanine**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids whose side chains contain **nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., indole group).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with **non-nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., phenyl group) in their side chains.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen atoms in the side chain provide **additional coordination sites**, enhancing metal binding and catalyst performance.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of extra coordination sites results in weaker metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with ether linkages (-O-) in aliphatic chains** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules containing **ether linkages (-O-)** along the aliphatic chain, alongside a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms can **chelate metal ions**, potentially leading to **undesirable coordination complexes** that interfere with the intended catalytic activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Straight-chain aliphatic acids containing only a **terminal carboxyl group (-COOH)** without other functional groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Simple, unbranched chains allow for **efficient packing** and minimal steric hindrance, facilitating effective coordination with the metal center.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl **(-OH)**, amino **(-NH₂)**) along the chain** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains bearing a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and additional **polar functional groups** along the chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Additional polar groups can introduce **steric hindrance** and **competing coordination**, disrupting optimal metal-ligand interactions and decreasing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups (-SH) directly attached to the aromatic ring** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: An aromatic ring with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and a **thiol group (-SH)** directly attached to the ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups on aromatic rings may bind too strongly to metal centers, **blocking active sites** and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups (-SH) on the aliphatic chain** tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains with both a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and a **thiol group (-SH)** along the chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Thiol groups on aliphatic chains can coordinate with metal centers without causing significant catalyst poisoning, enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles**, such as **pyridine** or **pyrazole**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings incorporating **nitrogen atoms** along with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms act as additional **coordination sites** for metal ions, enhancing metal-ligand binding and stabilizing the catalyst, leading to higher yields.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (sugar acids) with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)** tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules with an aliphatic chain bearing multiple **hydroxyl groups (-OH)** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form extensive **hydrogen-bonding networks** and offer **additional coordination sites**, enhancing metal binding and catalyst stability.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains where multiple hydrogen atoms are replaced with **fluorine atoms**, alongside a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorination increases **hydrophobicity** and can alter the **electronic environment** of the carboxyl group, potentially reducing effective metal coordination due to mismatched polarity.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with acylated or blocked amino groups (forming amide bonds)** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group (-NH₂)** is modified to form an **amide linkage (-CONH-)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Acylation reduces the number of **available coordination sites**, weakening the interaction between the modifier and the metal center.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups (-OCH₃) on the aromatic ring or aliphatic chain** can result in **variable yields**, but presence of multiple methoxy groups may lead to **high yield** due to enhanced electron-donating effects.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and one or more **methoxy groups (-OCH₃)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Methoxy groups are electron-donating and can influence the **electron density** of the aromatic system, potentially enhancing metal coordination.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying consistent patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures (functional groups) and incorporates underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** for any given structure that fits the descriptions. This systematic approach facilitates the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with higher coverage generalize predictions effectively, whereas more complex rules capture specific nuances that significantly impact the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules enhances understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance, aiding in the advancement of this chemical transformation.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise Rule 1 to specifically target α-amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups.**

  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern for Rule 1:
    ```python
    'patterns': [
        '[NX3][CX4H]',  # α-amino group
    ],
    'counts': {
        '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]': 2  # At least two carboxylic acid groups
    },
    ```
    This pattern checks for an α-amino group and at least two carboxylic acid groups anywhere in the molecule. However, it does not ensure that one of the carboxyl groups is part of a side chain, which is essential for this rule.

  - **Suggestion**: Modify the pattern to ensure that one carboxyl group is on the α-carbon and another is on a side chain (not directly attached to the α-carbon). You can use recursive SMARTS to specify the side-chain carboxyl group.

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        '[NX3][CX4H]',  # α-amino group attached to α-carbon
        '[CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Side-chain carboxylic acid
    ],
    'counts': {
        '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]': 2  # Exactly two carboxylic acid groups
    },
    ```

    This ensures that there is an α-amino acid backbone and a side-chain carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct Rule 2 to accurately detect electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern in Rule 2:
    ```python
    'patterns': [
        '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Aromatic carboxylic acid
        '[c][F,Cl,Br,I,NX3+](=O)[O-]',  # Halogen or nitro group attached to aromatic ring
    ],
    ```
    This pattern may not specifically check for substituents at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.

  - **Suggestion**: Use SMARTS that specifies the para relationship between the carboxyl group and the electron-withdrawing group.

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])cc1',  # Aromatic ring with carboxylic acid
        'c1cc([F,Cl,Br,I,NX3+](=O)[O-])ccc1',  # Electron-withdrawing group at para position
    ],
    ```
    Alternatively, combine into a single pattern:

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])c([F,Cl,Br,I,NX3+](=O)[O-])c1',  # Both groups in para positions
    ],
    ```

- **Suggestion 3**: **Update Rule 3 to detect aldehyde groups at ortho or para positions on aromatic rings.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern:
    ```python
    'patterns': [
        '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Aromatic carboxylic acid
        '[c][CX3H](=O)',  # Aldehyde group attached to aromatic ring
    ],
    ```
    Does not specify the position of the aldehyde group relative to the carboxyl group.

  - **Suggestion**: Adjust the SMARTS to check for aldehyde groups at ortho or para positions.

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])c([CX3H](=O))cc1',  # Para position
        'c1c([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])cc([CX3H](=O))cc1',  # Ortho position
    ],
    ```
    Or use a recursive SMARTS pattern that includes both positions.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Refine Rule 4 to correctly identify amino groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids.**

  - **Issue**: The pattern:
    ```python
    'patterns': [
        '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Aromatic carboxylic acid
        '[c][NX3H2]',  # Amino group attached to aromatic ring
    ],
    ```
    Does not specify that the amino group is at the para position.

  - **Suggestion**: Modify the pattern to ensure the amino group is para to the carboxyl group.

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])cc1',  # Aromatic ring with carboxylic acid
        'c1cc([NX3H2])ccc1',  # Amino group at para position
    ],
    ```
    Or combine into one pattern:

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])c([NX3H2])c1',  # Amino group para to carboxyl group
    ],
    ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **Enhance Rule 5 to differentiate between nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains in α-amino acids.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern may not effectively distinguish between the two types of side chains.

  - **Suggestion**: Implement patterns that specifically detect α-amino acid backbones with side chains containing nitrogenous aromatic rings.

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        '[NX3][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # α-amino acid backbone
        '[CX4][$(c[nH]),$(c[n])]'+  # Nitrogen-containing aromatic side chain
    ],
    ```
    Also, add an 'exclude_patterns' to prevent matching non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Adjust Rule 6 to accurately capture ethers in aliphatic chains.**

  - **Issue**: The pattern:
    ```python
    '[#6][OX2][#6]',  # Ether linkage in aliphatic chain
    ```
    May match any ether linkage, including those not in the main chain.

  - **Suggestion**: Ensure that the ether is part of the aliphatic chain leading to the carboxyl group.

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Carboxylic acid
        '[$([#6][OX2][#6][CX3](=O)[OX2H1])]',  # Ether linkage in chain to carboxylic acid
    ],
    ```

- **Suggestion 7**: **Refine Rule 7 to detect long aliphatic chains and exclude polar groups effectively.**

  - **Issue**: The current exclude patterns:
    ```python
    'exclude_patterns': ['[NX3]', '[OX2]', '[SX2]'],  # Exclude polar functional groups
    ```
    May not exclude all polar functional groups, and the pattern for the long chain is too specific.

  - **Suggestion**: Use a more general pattern for long aliphatic chains and expand the exclude patterns.

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Carboxylic acid
        '[CH2]' * 5 + '[CH3]',  # At least five CH2 units
    ],
    'exclude_patterns': ['[!#6;!H0]', '[OX2H]', '[NX3H2]', '[SX2H]', '[#7]', '[#8]', '[#16]'],  # Exclude any heteroatoms
    ```

- **Suggestion 8**: **Modify Rule 8 to detect polar functional groups along long aliphatic chains.**

  - **Issue**: The current patterns may not ensure that the polar groups are along the chain.

  - **Suggestion**: Use patterns that specify the polar groups are attached to the aliphatic chain.

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Carboxylic acid
        '[CX4][OX2H]',  # Hydroxyl group on chain
        '[CX4][NX3H2]',  # Amino group on chain
        '[CX4][SX2H]',  # Thiol group on chain
    ],
    ```

- **Suggestion 9**: **Adjust Rule 9 to ensure thiol groups are directly attached to the aromatic ring.**

  - **Issue**: The pattern:
    ```python
    '[c][SX2H]',  # Thiol group on aromatic ring
    ```
    May not exclusively catch thiols directly attached to the aromatic ring.

  - **Suggestion**: Use a more precise pattern.

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        '[c][SX2H]',  # Thiol directly attached to aromatic ring
        '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Aromatic carboxylic acid
    ],
    ```

- **Suggestion 10**: **Ensure Rule 11 detects nitrogen-containing heterocycles on aromatic carboxylic acids.**

  - **Issue**: The pattern for nitrogen atoms in rings:

    ```python
    '[n]',  # Nitrogen atom in ring
    ```

    May match any nitrogen in any ring, not necessarily connected to the carboxylic acid.

  - **Suggestion**: Specify that the nitrogen-containing heterocycle is attached to the aromatic carboxylic acid.

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Aromatic carboxylic acid
        '[c][n]',  # Nitrogen heterocycle attached to aromatic ring
    ],
    ```

- **Suggestion 11**: **Improve Rule 12 to detect molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy acids).**

  - **Issue**: The count:

    ```python
    'counts': {
        '[OX2H]': 2  # At least two hydroxyl groups
    },
    ```

    May count hydroxyl groups anywhere, including those not on the aliphatic chain.

  - **Suggestion**: Ensure that the hydroxyl groups are on carbons adjacent to each other in an aliphatic chain.

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Carboxylic acid
        '[CX4](O)[CX4](O)',  # Adjacent hydroxyl groups
    ],
    ```

- **Suggestion 12**: **Refine Rule 13 to detect heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids accurately.**

  - **Issue**: The count:

    ```python
    'counts': {
        '[F]': 3  # At least three fluorine atoms
    },
    ```

    May include molecules with fluorine atoms not necessarily in the aliphatic chain.

  - **Suggestion**: Ensure that the fluorines are on the aliphatic chain leading to the carboxyl group.

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Carboxylic acid
        '[CX4](F)(F)(F)',  # Carbon with three fluorine atoms
    ],
    ```

- **Suggestion 13**: **Correct Rule 14 to detect amino acids with acylated or blocked amino groups forming amide bonds.**

  - **Issue**: The current patterns may not effectively identify amide bonds on amino acids.

  - **Suggestion**: Adjust the patterns to specifically detect N-acylated amino acids.

    ```python
    'patterns': [
        '[NX3][CX3](=O)[#6]',  # Amide bond indicating acylated amino group
        '[NX3][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]',  # Presence of amino acid backbone
    ],
    ```

    Additionally, modify the logic to ensure that the amino group of the amino acid backbone is acylated.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Enhance Rule 15 to account for variable yields based on the number of methoxy groups.**

  - **Issue**: The current count:

    ```python
    'counts': {
        '[c][OX2][CH3]': 2  # At least two methoxy groups on aromatic ring
    },
    ```

    May not capture molecules with varying numbers of methoxy groups or consider their positions.

  - **Suggestion**: Modify the count to allow for one or more methoxy groups and adjust the prediction accordingly.

    ```python
    'counts': {
        '[c][OX2][CH3]': 1  # At least one methoxy group on aromatic ring
    },
    'prediction': 0,  # Variable yield, adjust prediction logic based on count
    ```

    Alternatively, implement logic that increases the prediction score with the number of methoxy groups.

- **Suggestion 15**: **General Improvements**

  - **Implement Exception Handling**: Add more robust exception handling to catch and report errors during pattern matching, aiding in debugging.

  - **Validate SMARTS Patterns**: Before compiling, validate each SMARTS pattern to ensure it's syntactically correct.

  - **Provide Detailed Logging**: Include logging statements that indicate which patterns matched or failed for each molecule, facilitating easier troubleshooting.

  - **Use Recursive SMARTS**: For complex patterns involving specific positional relationships (e.g., ortho, meta, para substitutions), use recursive SMARTS or built-in RDKit functions to specify these positions.

  - **Test Patterns Individually**: Before integrating into the code, test each SMARTS pattern independently on known molecules to confirm correct matching.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Rule Metrics**

After reviewing the current rule metrics and comparing them with the reference metrics from previous iterations, we can make the following observations regarding the performance of the current rules, focusing particularly on **confidence** and **lift**, as requested.

---

### **Comparison with Previous Metrics**

**1. Confidence:**

- **Previous Train Confidence:** [0.635 (63.5%), 0.540 (54.0%)]
- **Current Train Confidence:** Ranges from 0.5667 (56.7%) to **0.7890 (78.9%)**, with the final aggregated value at **0.7796 (77.96%)**

**Observation:** The current rules exhibit a **notable increase in confidence** compared to previous iterations. The highest confidence achieved in the previous metrics was approximately 63.5%, whereas the current rules consistently surpass this value, reaching up to nearly 79%.

---

**2. Lift:**

- **Previous Train Lift:** [1.205, 1.056]
- **Current Train Lift:** Ranges from 1.1259 to **1.5783**, with the final aggregated value at **1.5649**

**Observation:** There is a significant improvement in the **lift** of the current rules compared to previous metrics. The lift values have increased from just above 1 (indicating a modest improvement over random chance) to values exceeding **1.5**, suggesting that the current rules are much more effective at improving prediction over the baseline probability.

---

**3. Support:**

- **Previous Train Support:** [0.1667 (16.67%), 0.1845 (18.45%)]
- **Current Train Support:** Ranges from 0.0095 (0.95%) to **0.0876 (8.76%)**, with the final aggregated value at **0.04 (4%)**

**Observation:** While **confidence and lift have improved**, there is a **decrease in support**. The current rules cover a **smaller portion of the dataset**, with support values significantly lower than previous iterations. The final support value stands at 4%, compared to over 16% previously.

---

**4. Leverage:**

- **Previous Train Leverage:** [0.0289, -0.0041]
- **Current Train Leverage:** Ranges from 0.0046 to **0.0215**, with the final aggregated value at **0.0117**

**Observation:** The current leverage values are positive and somewhat lower than the highest previous leverage but higher than the negative value observed before. Positive leverage indicates a stronger association than expected by chance, though the magnitude is moderate.

---

### **Interpretation of Findings**

- **Increased Confidence and Lift:** The higher confidence and lift values indicate that, when the current rules apply, they are more reliable and provide more significant improvement over baseline predictions. This suggests that the rules are effective at identifying conditions that lead to high yields.

- **Decreased Support:** The lower support values mean that the rules apply to a smaller subset of the data. This could imply that the current rules are **too specific** or **overfitted** to certain cases, which limits their general applicability.

- **Trade-off Between Confidence and Support:** There is an inherent trade-off where increasing confidence and lift may lead to reduced support. Highly specific rules can yield higher confidence but may not be useful if they apply to very few cases.

---

### **Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

Given the current metrics, it appears that:

- **Confidence and Lift Have Plateaued:** The confidence and lift have reached relatively high values in this iteration. Further significant improvements may be challenging without compromising support.

- **Support is Low:** The decrease in support suggests that the model may have reached a point where further optimization of confidence and lift results in diminishing returns due to reduced applicability.

- **Risk of Overfitting:** The high confidence and lift, coupled with low support, indicate that the rules may be overfitting the training data, capturing noise or very specific patterns that do not generalize well.

In this context, it may be considered that a **local minimum has been reached** in terms of optimizing confidence and lift without sacrificing support. Additional iterations focusing solely on increasing confidence and lift are likely to further reduce support and may not lead to practical improvements.

---

### **Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the rules while maintaining a balance between confidence, lift, and support, the following steps are recommended:

**1. Broaden Rule Coverage:**

- **Generalize Rules:** Review the current rules to identify opportunities where rules can be generalized without substantially reducing confidence and lift. This may involve merging similar rules or removing overly specific conditions.

- **Increase Support:** Aim to create rules that apply to a larger portion of the dataset by focusing on more common features or patterns that still contribute positively to prediction quality.

**2. Balance Complexity and Simplicity:**

- **Simplify Complex Rules:** Some rules may be too complex, capturing very niche cases. Simplifying these rules can increase support and make them more broadly applicable.

- **Retain Critical Features:** Ensure that simplification does not eliminate critical chemical features that are essential for maintaining high confidence and lift.

**3. Re-evaluate Rule Conditions:**

- **Analyze Low-Support High-Confidence Rules:** Investigate whether the high-confidence rules with very low support are due to rare but significant patterns or if they are artifacts of overfitting.

- **Adjust Thresholds:** Consider adjusting the thresholds for rule inclusion (e.g., minimum support) to ensure that rules contribute meaningfully to overall performance.

**4. Incorporate More Data:**

- **Expand Dataset:** If possible, incorporate additional data to provide more instances where the rules can apply, potentially increasing support.

- **Validate with Test Data:** Evaluate the rules using a separate test set to assess their generalizability and prevent overfitting.

**5. Focus on Leverage:**

- **Improve Leverage:** Aim to increase the leverage values, as this reflects the additional support the rules gain over what would be expected by chance. Higher leverage indicates stronger, more meaningful associations.

**6. Multi-Objective Optimization:**

- **Balance Multiple Metrics:** Use a multi-objective optimization approach to find rules that optimize confidence, lift, and support simultaneously, rather than focusing on a single metric.

---

### **Specific Suggestions for Current Rules**

- **Combine Similar Rules:** Some rules may overlap or address similar chemical features (e.g., Rules 2 and 4 regarding electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids). Combining these rules could increase support.

- **Revise Overly Specific Rules:** Rules with very narrow conditions (e.g., Rule 13 on heavily fluorinated acids) may have low support. Broaden these rules to include more compounds without significantly impacting confidence.

- **Analyze Exceptions:** For rules that have high confidence but low support, investigate whether there are exceptions or additional conditions that, if included, could widen applicability.

- **Explore New Patterns:** Look for additional patterns or features in the data that have not been captured by the current rules but could contribute to higher support while maintaining acceptable confidence levels.

---

### **Conclusion**

The current rules exhibit **improved confidence and lift** compared to previous iterations, indicating that they are effective in predicting high yields when applicable. However, the **reduced support** suggests that these rules are applicable to a smaller subset of data, limiting their overall utility.

To enhance the performance of the rules, it is essential to **balance confidence, lift, and support** by broadening rule applicability without significantly compromising prediction quality. By generalizing rules, simplifying overly complex conditions, and focusing on increasing leverage, the rules can be made more robust and useful for predicting catalytic performance across a wider range of compounds.

Continued iterations should focus on **adjusting the rules to increase support** while maintaining acceptable levels of confidence and lift. This balanced approach will lead to a more generalizable and effective set of rules for guiding the selection of molecular modifiers in the catalytic process.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Refine and Test Rules:** Implement the suggested improvements and test the revised rules on both training and test datasets to evaluate their performance.

- **Monitor Metrics:** Continuously monitor changes in support, confidence, lift, and leverage to assess the impact of modifications.

- **Prevent Overfitting:** Ensure that the rules generalize well by validating against unseen data and avoiding excessive tailoring to the training set.

By following these recommendations, the current rules can be improved to offer more comprehensive guidance in the research program while maintaining high predictive accuracy.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

---

**1. Refine Rules with High Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations**

- **Rule11**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles tend to result in high yield.*

  - **Issue**: High negative SHAP values lead to underestimations in molecules where the experimental loading is high.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Re-evaluate the scope** of Rule11 to ensure it accurately captures molecules that indeed result in high loading.
    - **Consider exceptions** or **subgroups** within nitrogen-containing heterocycles that may not adhere to the rule.
    - **Adjust the rule** to account for substituents or structural variations that affect the coordination ability.

**2. Adjust Rules with High Positive SHAP Values in Overestimations**

- **Rule3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups at ortho or para positions tend to result in low yield.*

  - **Issue**: Positive SHAP values contribute to overestimations in some cases.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Clarify the conditions** under which aldehyde groups interfere with catalyst activity.
    - **Incorporate additional structural features** or contexts that differentiate when an aldehyde group leads to low versus high yield.
    - **Modify the rule** to improve specificity, perhaps by considering electronic effects or steric hindrance caused by adjacent groups.

**3. Re-express or Combine Rules to Improve Generalization**

- **Rule13**: *Modifiers that are heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids tend to result in low yield.*

  - **Issue**: Extremely high negative SHAP values suggest over-penalization, potentially causing underfitting.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Balance the influence** of Rule13 by adjusting its weight or scope.
    - **Analyze** whether all heavily fluorinated acids result in low yield or if there are exceptions.
    - **Integrate this rule** with others that consider electronic and steric effects to improve generalization.

**4. Address Overfitting and Underfitting**

- **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**:
  - **Complex rules** may be causing the model to focus too narrowly on specific cases.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Simplify rules** where possible, focusing on the most impactful chemical features.
    - **Remove redundant or overlapping rules** to reduce complexity.

- **Enhance Underrepresented Features**:
  - **Underfitting** may be due to missing important descriptors.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Introduce new rules** that capture missing patterns identified in misclassifications.
    - **Incorporate additional chemical features**, such as electronic effects, steric factors, or solubility considerations.

**5. Leverage SHAP Insights for Iterative Refinement**

- **Use SHAP Values to Identify Key Features**:
  - **High-magnitude SHAP values** highlight features with significant impact.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Investigate rules associated with extreme SHAP values** to determine if they align with chemical intuition.
    - **Adjust rule thresholds** or conditions based on SHAP analysis to mitigate mispredictions.

- **Validate Adjustments with Cross-Validation**:
  - **Prevent overfitting** by testing rule changes on multiple folds.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Iteratively test** rule modifications and observe changes in validation accuracy.
    - **Aim for consistent improvements** across different validation sets.

**6. Consider Rule Interactions**

- **Evaluate Synergistic or Antagonistic Effects**:
  - Some rules may interact in ways that amplify or negate each other's effects.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Analyze combinations of rules** that frequently occur in mispredictions.
    - **Adjust rules** to account for interactions, possibly by merging or differentiating them.

---

**Concluding Remarks**

The current set of rules is not effectively capturing the underlying relationships between molecular features and catalyst loading, as indicated by the reduced validation accuracy and SHAP analysis. By refining the rules associated with significant mispredictions and adjusting for overfitting or underfitting, the model's performance can be improved. Leveraging insights from SHAP values allows for targeted modifications to the rules, enhancing their predictive power and generalization to new data.

---

**Next Steps**

1. **Prioritize Rule Adjustments**:
   - Start with **Rule11**, **Rule13**, and **Rule3**, as they have the most impact on mispredictions.

2. **Implement Changes Iteratively**:
   - **Adjust one rule at a time** and observe the effect on model performance.

3. **Monitor Model Metrics**:
   - Track **validation accuracy** and **SHAP value distributions** after each change.

4. **Engage in Collaborative Review**:
   - **Discuss proposed changes** with colleagues to incorporate diverse expertise.

5. **Document Adjustments**:
   - Keep a **detailed record** of modifications for transparency and future reference.

By systematically refining the rules and leveraging SHAP analysis, we can enhance the model's ability to predict catalyst loading accurately, ultimately contributing to the advancement of the research program.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The recent analyses of the current rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction have highlighted several critical points:

1. **Improvements in Confidence and Lift but Decreased Support:**
   - **Confidence and Lift:** The current rules show higher confidence and lift compared to previous iterations, indicating that when they apply, they are more reliable and significantly better than random chance.
   - **Support:** There is a notable decrease in support, meaning the rules apply to a smaller subset of the data. This limits their practical utility and suggests that the rules may be too specific or overfitted to particular cases.

2. **Decrease in Validation Accuracy:**
   - The validation accuracy has significantly decreased from approximately 76% in previous iterations to around 48.57% in the current iteration.
   - This decline indicates that the model is underfitting, failing to capture the underlying patterns in the data effectively.

3. **Potential Overfitting and Underfitting:**
   - Overly complex or overly specific rules may cause overfitting to the training data.
   - The low validation accuracy suggests underfitting, where the model does not generalize well to new data.

4. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - Certain rules contribute significantly to mispredictions, as indicated by high positive or negative SHAP values.
   - For example, **Rule 11** often has high negative SHAP values in cases where the experimental yield is high but predicted as low, suggesting the rule may be too restrictive.

**Directions and Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

To optimize the current rules and enhance the model's performance, the following directions and suggestions are proposed:

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Specificity and Accuracy:**
   - **Adjust Rule Patterns:** Modify the SMARTS patterns in each rule to ensure they accurately capture the intended chemical features.
     - For example, in **Rule 2**, ensure that the electron-withdrawing group is specifically at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.
     - Use recursive SMARTS or more precise patterns to specify positional relationships.

2. **Increase Support by Broadening Rule Applicability:**
   - **Generalize Overly Specific Rules:** Simplify rules that are too narrow to cover a broader range of compounds without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
     - Combine similar rules that address related chemical features.
     - Remove unnecessary conditions that limit the scope of the rules.

3. **Balance Rule Complexity and Simplicity:**
   - **Simplify Complex Rules:** Overly complex rules may capture noise rather than meaningful patterns. Focus on essential chemical features that have the most significant impact on yield.
   - **Retain Critical Chemical Features:** Ensure that simplification does not eliminate important structural motifs necessary for accurate predictions.

4. **Adjust Rules Based on SHAP Analysis:**
   - **Re-evaluate Influential Rules:** Identify rules that contribute to mispredictions (e.g., **Rule 11**, **Rule 13**) and adjust them to better reflect the underlying chemistry.
     - For **Rule 11**, consider whether all nitrogen-containing heterocycles contribute to high yield or if there are exceptions.
     - Modify rules to account for substituents or structural variations that affect coordination ability.

5. **Enhance Rule Coverage and Consistency:**
   - **Ensure Comprehensive Coverage:** Review the rules to eliminate conflicts and overlaps, ensuring they collectively cover a substantial portion of the dataset.
   - **Incorporate Additional Patterns:** Introduce new rules or patterns that capture missing chemical features influencing the reaction yield.

6. **Optimize Rule Conditions and Thresholds:**
   - **Adjust Counts and Conditions:** Modify counts and conditions within the rules to balance support and confidence.
     - For instance, in **Rule 13**, consider adjusting the required number of fluorine atoms to prevent over-penalization.

7. **Validate Rule Modifications:**
   - **Cross-Validation:** Test rule changes using cross-validation to ensure that they improve model performance without overfitting.
   - **Monitor Metrics Continuously:** Observe changes in support, confidence, lift, leverage, and validation accuracy after each modification.

8. **Incorporate Chemical Intuition and Expertise:**
   - **Expert Review:** Engage with chemists to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules.
   - **Align with Mechanistic Understanding:** Ensure that the rules align with known chemical mechanisms and coordination chemistry principles.

9. **Consider Rule Interactions:**
   - **Analyze Interactions:** Evaluate how rules interact with each other, identifying synergistic or antagonistic effects.
   - **Adjust Accordingly:** Modify rules to account for these interactions, improving overall model coherence.

10. **Implement Robust Exception Handling and Logging:**
    - **Error Handling:** Add exception handling to catch and report errors during pattern matching.
    - **Detailed Logging:** Provide logs indicating which patterns matched or failed for each molecule to facilitate troubleshooting.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Balancing Metrics:** By adjusting the rules to increase support while maintaining acceptable confidence and lift, the model can better generalize to new data.
- **Preventing Overfitting:** Simplifying rules and focusing on essential features help prevent overfitting to specific training instances.
- **Improving Underfitting:** Enhancing rules to capture more underlying patterns in the data addresses underfitting issues.

**Conclusion**

By implementing the suggested refinements and carefully validating the changes, the current rules can be optimized to improve the model's predictive performance. This process will involve a balance between rule specificity and generality, ensuring that the rules are both chemically meaningful and statistically robust.

These rules have been carefully developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying consistent patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures (functional groups) and incorporates underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** for any given structure that fits the descriptions. This systematic approach facilitates the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with higher coverage generalize predictions effectively, whereas more complex rules capture specific nuances that significantly impact the reaction yield. This comprehensive set of rules enhances understanding of how different molecular features influence catalytic performance, aiding in the advancement of this chemical transformation.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Accurate Substituent Positioning**

  - **Implementation**: Modify the SMARTS patterns in the rules to precisely specify the position of substituents relative to functional groups. This ensures that only the intended positional isomers are matched.
  
  - **Example for Rule 2**: In Rule 2, the electron-withdrawing group must be at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group on an aromatic ring. Adjust the SMARTS pattern to reflect this:
  
    - **Original SMARTS**: `c(c)ccc(c)C(=O)O`
    - **Refined SMARTS**: `c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)[$(N(=O)=O),$(Cl),$(Br),$(F)]`
      - This pattern specifies that the electron-withdrawing group (e.g., nitro, halogen) is at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.
  
  - **Benefit**: Increases accuracy by capturing only the compounds with substituents at the correct position, improving prediction reliability.

- **Advice 2**: **Simplify Overly Specific Rules to Increase Support**

  - **Implementation**: Generalize rules that are too narrow by combining similar rules or removing unnecessary constraints, thereby covering more compounds without sacrificing confidence and lift.
  
  - **Example**: Combine Rule 1 (α-amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups) and Rule 5 (α-amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains) into a broader rule:
  
    - **New Rule**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains capable of metal coordination** (e.g., containing **carboxyl, amino, or nitrogenous aromatic groups**) tend to result in **high yield**.
  
  - **Benefit**: Increases the rule's applicability and support while maintaining its predictive power.

- **Advice 3**: **Adjust Rules Contributing to Mispredictions Based on SHAP Analysis**

  - **Implementation**: Re-evaluate rules identified by SHAP analysis as contributing to mispredictions and refine them to better align with observed data.
  
  - **Example for Rule 11**: Rule 11 currently states that modifiers with **any** nitrogen-containing heterocycles result in high yield. However, data shows exceptions.
  
    - **Refined Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles that act as good ligands**, such as **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, tend to result in **high yield**. Exclude heterocycles that do not enhance coordination or may sterically hinder metal binding.
  
  - **Benefit**: Reduces mispredictions by excluding compounds that do not conform to the intended chemical rationale.

- **Advice 4**: **Adjust Thresholds in Rules to Balance Specificity and Generality**

  - **Implementation**: Modify counts and thresholds within rules to avoid over-penalizing certain compounds and to increase support.
  
  - **Example for Rule 13**: Redefine "heavily fluorinated" to require a higher number of fluorine atoms:
  
    - **Original Requirement**: Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms.
    - **Adjusted Requirement**: Modifiers with **six or more fluorine atoms** tend to result in **low yield**.
  
  - **Benefit**: Prevents compounds with fewer fluorine atoms from being incorrectly classified as low yield, increasing the rule's accuracy.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance Rule Coverage by Creating Broader Rules**

  - **Implementation**: Identify common functional groups that positively influence yield and create rules encompassing these features.
  
  - **Example**: Develop a rule for modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)** capable of forming strong metal-ligand interactions, leading to high yield.
  
    - **New Rule**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** tend to result in **high yield**.
  
  - **Benefit**: Increases support and captures additional compounds contributing to high yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Remove or Modify Rules That Frequently Mispredict**

  - **Implementation**: Eliminate rules that do not significantly improve model performance or adjust them to better reflect the dataset.
  
  - **Example**: If Rule 9 (aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups result in low yield) leads to frequent mispredictions, consider refining it:
  
    - **Refined Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups (-SH) at positions that hinder metal coordination** tend to result in **low yield**.
  
  - **Benefit**: Reduces misclassifications and aligns the rule more closely with observed chemical behavior.

- **Advice 7**: **Introduce New Rules to Cover Unaddressed Patterns in Mispredicted Data**

  - **Implementation**: Analyze mispredicted compounds to identify features not captured by existing rules and create new rules accordingly.
  
  - **Example**: Identify that modifiers with **blocked or acylated amino groups** lead to low yield:
  
    - **New Rule**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with acylated amino groups (-NH-CO-)** tend to result in **low yield**.
  
  - **Benefit**: Improves overall model accuracy by accounting for previously unrecognized factors affecting yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Validate Rule Modifications with Cross-Validation and Performance Monitoring**

  - **Implementation**: After each rule adjustment, perform cross-validation and carefully monitor metrics such as validation accuracy, support, confidence, and lift.
  
  - **Benefit**: Ensures that rule changes lead to genuine performance improvements and do not introduce new issues like overfitting or underfitting.

- **Advice 9**: **Align Rules with Chemical Intuition and Mechanistic Understanding**

  - **Implementation**: Consult with chemists to ensure rules make sense chemically and reflect known mechanisms, such as the importance of metal coordination in catalyst activity.
  
  - **Benefit**: Increases the likelihood that rules will generalize well to new compounds and reactions, enhancing their practical utility.

- **Advice 10**: **Improve SMARTS Patterns Using Advanced Features**

  - **Implementation**: Utilize recursive SMARTS and advanced syntax to precisely define complex structures and relative positions of functional groups.
  
  - **Example**: In specifying para-substitution, use SMARTS like:
  
    - `[$(c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O)]` to define a benzoic acid core.
    - `[$(c1cc(N(=O)=O)ccc1C(=O)O)]` to specify a nitro group at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.
  
  - **Benefit**: Enhances the specificity and accuracy of pattern matching, reducing false positives and negatives.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** excels in clarity, allowing easy identification of modifiers that are α-amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining how bidentate coordination enhances catalyst activity. The rule involves a combination of functional groups, showing appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (entries 0 and 2), ensuring adequate coverage and a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clear and straightforward, specifying aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. The underlying property insight about increased acidity improving metal coordination is sound. The rule combines multiple substructures, reflecting suitable complexity. It is well-supported by data (entries 1 and 20), providing sufficient coverage and maintaining a balance between detail and applicability.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** clearly identifies modifiers with electron-donating groups at the para position leading to low yield. The property insight about decreased acidity weakening metal-ligand interactions is logical. The rule's complexity is appropriate, considering specific substitutions on aromatic rings. Supported by at least two data points (entries 22 and 30), it meets the coverage requirement and balances complexity with practical use.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** distinguishes between α-amino acids with nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains, with clear criteria. The physical-chemical explanation regarding additional coordination sites is reasonable. The rule has suitable complexity by contrasting different side chains. It is backed by data (entries 12 and 14), satisfying coverage needs and presenting a balanced approach.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** provides clarity in identifying aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups leading to low yield. The insight about side reactions interfering with metal coordination is adequate. Complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific functional groups at defined positions. Supported by data (entries 18 and 19), the rule has sufficient coverage and maintains balance.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear in describing aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages resulting in low yield. The physical-chemical properties concerning unintended coordination are well-explained. The rule shows appropriate complexity by considering the ether linkage within the chain. It is supported by at least two data points (entries 10 and 32), ensuring coverage and a balanced complexity.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** clearly identifies long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar groups leading to high yield. The property insight about minimal steric hindrance is sensible. The rule is simple yet effective, with acceptable complexity. Supported by data (entry 5), although only one explicit example is given, similar compounds may exist, slightly affecting coverage but maintaining balance.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** maintains clarity by specifying long-chain aliphatic acids with additional polar groups resulting in low yield. The explanation regarding steric hindrance and competing interactions is logical. Complexity is suitable, and the rule is supported by multiple data points (entries 29, 31, and 34), satisfying coverage and balance criteria.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** clearly differentiates between aromatic and aliphatic thiol-containing modifiers. The property insights about catalyst poisoning and enhanced coordination are valid. Complexity is appropriate, and coverage is met with data supporting both cases (entries 9 and 17), achieving a balanced perspective.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** has clear criteria for modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles resulting in high yield. The physical-chemical insight about additional coordination sites is strong. Complexity is appropriate, and the rule is supported by data (entries 7, 15, and 21), providing good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear in defining polyhydroxy carboxylic acids leading to high yield. The property insight regarding multiple coordination sites is acceptable. However, the rule is only supported by one data point (entry 8), which is insufficient for coverage. The lack of additional examples affects the balance, indicating a need for more supporting data.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** clearly identifies heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids resulting in low yield. The insight about altered electronic properties reducing coordination is reasonable. Complexity is acceptable, and coverage is met with at least one data point (entry 13). Additional data would strengthen coverage and balance.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** provides clear criteria for amino acids with acylated amino groups leading to low yield. The physical-chemical explanation about reduced coordination sites is logical. The rule's complexity is suitable, and coverage is met with data (entries 23 and 33), ensuring balance.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** differentiates between modifiers with multiple methoxy groups and those with single methoxy groups. Clarity is satisfactory, though "variable yields" could be more precisely defined. The property insight is plausible. Complexity is appropriate. Supported by at least one data point (entry 25), but limited examples affect coverage and balance.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is clear in identifying modifiers with fused nitrogen-containing rings leading to low yield due to steric hindrance. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable. Complexity is suitable. However, it appears to be supported by a single data point (entry 11), which impacts coverage and balance.

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains where many hydrogen atoms are replaced with **fluorine atoms**, along with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorination increases **hydrophobicity** and can reduce effective **metal-ligand coordination** due to altered electronic properties.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with acylated or blocked amino groups (forming amide bonds)** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group (-NH₂)** is modified to form an **amide linkage (-CONH-)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Acylation reduces available **coordination sites**, weakening interactions with metal centers and decreasing catalytic effectiveness.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with multiple methoxy groups (-OCH₃) on the aromatic ring** tend to result in **high yield**, while those with single methoxy groups may result in **variable yields**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and one or more **methoxy groups (-OCH₃)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple methoxy groups can enhance **electron donation**, potentially increasing **metal coordination** if properly positioned.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 1**, modify the code to ensure that the **additional carboxyl group (-COOH) is specifically on the side chain** of the α-amino acid. Currently, the code only checks for the presence of at least two carboxylic acid groups but does not verify the location of the second one. Use SMARTS patterns that distinguish side-chain carboxyl groups from the backbone carboxyl group.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: In **Rule 4**, adjust the code to verify that the **nitrogen-containing aromatic ring or the non-nitrogenous aromatic ring is part of the side chain** of the amino acid. The current implementation checks for any nitrogen-containing aromatic ring or aromatic ring in the molecule, which may lead to false positives. Implement SMARTS patterns that specifically target side-chain attachments to the α-carbon.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 8**, refine the code to confirm that the modifiers are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** and that the **additional polar functional groups are located along the chain** (excluding terminal positions). The current code does not check for chain length or the position of polar groups. Incorporate checks for chain length (e.g., at least six carbons) and exclude molecules where polar groups are terminal.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: In **Rule 11**, enhance the code to specifically detect **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (sugar acids)** by checking for **multiple hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons** (vicinal diols). The current code only counts the number of hydroxyl groups, which may include non-adjacent hydroxyls. Use SMARTS patterns that identify sugar-like structures.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For **Rule 15**, modify the code to ensure it correctly identifies **fused nitrogen-containing aromatic rings**. The current code checks for any ring larger than six atoms containing nitrogen, which could misidentify structures. Implement SMARTS patterns that detect specific fused ring systems with nitrogen atoms directly involved in the fusion.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Across several rules (e.g., **Rules 2, 3, and 5**), incorporate positional specificity in the SMARTS patterns to match functional groups at **ortho or para positions** on aromatic rings. The existing code lacks position-specific checks, which is essential for accurately applying these rules. Use SMARTS patterns with positional annotations to target substituents at specific positions.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: In **Rule 14**, adjust the code to check that the **methoxy groups are directly attached to the aromatic ring** and consider their positions. The current code counts all methoxy groups regardless of their location, which may not align with the rule's intent. Use SMARTS patterns that specifically match methoxy substituents on aromatic carbons.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For improved accuracy, consider **combining multiple SMARTS patterns** where necessary to capture the full scope of a rule. For example, in **Rule 9**, differentiate between thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring versus those on an aliphatic chain by refining the SMARTS patterns for 'thiol_aromatic' and 'thiol_aliphatic'.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Implement **additional validation steps** within each rule function to check for unintended matches. For instance, ensure that matches for electron-withdrawing or donating groups in **Rules 2 and 3** are actually substituted on the aromatic ring and not elsewhere in the molecule.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Document the reasoning** behind each SMARTS pattern and rule implementation within the code. This will aid in verifying that the patterns align with the natural language rules and make future updates easier.

    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, tend to result in **high yield**, whereas those with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains, like **phenylalanine**, tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., indole group).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with **non-nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., phenyl group).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen atoms offer additional **coordination sites** for metal ions, enhancing catalyst performance.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of extra coordination sites leads to weaker metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups (-CHO) at the ortho or para positions** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: An aromatic ring bearing a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and an **aldehyde group (-CHO)** at the ortho or para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups may engage in **side reactions** or interfere with metal coordination, disrupting optimal metal-ligand interactions and decreasing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages (-O-) along the chain** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules containing **ether linkages (-O-)** within the aliphatic chain and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms may form **unintended coordination** with metal ions, leading to complexes that interfere with catalytic activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Straight-chain aliphatic acids with a **terminal carboxyl group (-COOH)** and no other functional groups along the chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: These chains provide minimal steric hindrance, allowing efficient **metal-ligand coordination** and enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl **(-OH)**, amino **(-NH₂)**) along the chain** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic acids with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and extra **polar groups** on the chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Additional polar groups can cause **steric hindrance** or form **competing interactions** with metal ions, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups (-SH) directly attached to the aromatic ring** tend to result in **low yield**, while those with thiol groups on aliphatic chains tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic rings with **-SH** directly attached.
    - **High Yield**: Aliphatic chains with **-SH** groups.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic thiols may strongly bind to metal centers, causing **catalyst poisoning**.
    - **High Yield**: Aliphatic thiols can enhance **metal coordination** without inhibiting active sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
    - **High Yield**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole rings**, tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic systems incorporating **nitrogen heterocycles** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms act as additional **coordination sites**, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst stability.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (sugar acids) with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)** tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic acids with several **hydroxyl groups (-OH)** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional **hydrogen bonding** and potential **coordination sites**, stabilizing metal complexes.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains where many hydrogen atoms are replaced with **fluorine atoms**, along with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorination increases **hydrophobicity** and can reduce effective **metal-ligand coordination** due to altered electronic properties.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with acylated or blocked amino groups (forming amide bonds)** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group (-NH₂)** is modified to form an **amide linkage (-CONH-)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Acylation reduces available **coordination sites**, weakening interactions with metal centers and decreasing catalytic effectiveness.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with multiple methoxy groups (-OCH₃) on the aromatic ring** tend to result in **high yield**, while those with single methoxy groups may result in **variable yields**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and one or more **methoxy groups (-OCH₃)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple methoxy groups can enhance **electron donation**, potentially increasing **metal coordination** if properly positioned.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
    - **Variable Yield**: Compounds with fewer methoxy groups

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with fused nitrogen-containing rings** may result in **low yield** due to **steric hindrance** affecting metal coordination.

  - **Chemical Features**: Complex fused aromatic systems with **nitrogen atoms** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Bulky structures can hinder effective **metal-ligand interactions**, reducing catalytic performance.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Modify Rule 1's side-chain detection logic.** In the current code for Rule 1, only the immediate neighbors of the alpha carbon (excluding backbone atoms) are considered as the side chain. This approach misses larger side chains that extend beyond one atom, such as in aspartic acid and glutamic acid. To accurately capture the entire side chain, implement a recursive function or use a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the alpha carbon to collect all connected atoms that are not part of the backbone. This will ensure that multi-atom side chains are fully included when checking for the presence of a side-chain carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct the SMARTS pattern for carboxylic acids to exclude backbone carboxyl groups in side-chain searches.** Ensure that when searching for side-chain carboxylic acids, the code does not mistakenly identify the backbone carboxyl group. Modify the SMARTS pattern or add constraints to differentiate between backbone and side-chain carboxylic acid groups. One approach is to label the backbone atoms during the backbone match and then exclude them in the side-chain carboxylic acid search.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Adjust the SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) in Rule 2.** The current pattern for EWGs at the para position (`ewg_para_benzene`) may not correctly identify nitro groups because nitro groups in SMILES are often represented as `[N+](=O)[O-]`. Update the EWG pattern to include this representation:
  ```python
  ewg_para_benzene = 'c1cc([N+](=O)[O-],F,Cl,Br,I)ccc1C(=O)[OX1H1]'
  ```
  This modification ensures that nitro groups are accurately detected at the para position on the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Revise the SMARTS patterns for electron-donating groups (EDGs) in Rule 3.** Ensure that methoxy groups (`-OCH₃`) attached to aromatic rings are correctly identified. The current pattern may not match all EDGs. Update the pattern to:
  ```python
  edg_para_benzene = 'c1cc([CH3,OCH3,OH])ccc1C(=O)[OX1H1]'
  ```
  This pattern includes methyl (`-CH₃`), methoxy (`-OCH₃`), and hydroxyl (`-OH`) groups, covering common EDGs at the para position.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Enhance Rule 4 to correctly identify nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains.** The current code for Rule 4 may not capture side chains with nitrogenous aromatic rings if the side chain extends beyond immediate neighbors. Implement a recursive search or use subgraph matching to include the entire side chain connected to the alpha carbon. Additionally, update the SMARTS pattern for nitrogen-containing aromatic rings to match other relevant heterocycles:
  ```python
  nitrogen_aromatic_ring = '[n]1[c,cH][c,cH][c,cH][c,cH][c,cH]1'
  ```
  This pattern captures common nitrogen-containing aromatic systems, such as pyridine and indole rings.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Include the implementation of all remaining rules (Rules 5 to 15).** The current code only implements Rules 1 through 4, which limits the feature matrix to those rules. To fully capture the transformation from language rules to the numeric feature matrix, write functions for each of the remaining rules, define the corresponding SMARTS patterns, and integrate them into the matrix generation process.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Validate and test each SMARTS pattern against example molecules.** Before finalizing the SMARTS patterns, test them using RDKit to ensure they correctly match the intended chemical structures. For each rule, verify that the pattern matches the examples provided and does not produce false positives or negatives. Adjust the patterns based on the test results to improve accuracy.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Handle tautomers and resonance structures in SMARTS matching.** Some functional groups may exist in tautomeric forms or have resonance structures that could affect substructure matching. Use RDKit's tautomer handling or include additional patterns to account for these variations, ensuring that all relevant structures are recognized by the rules.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Consider stereochemistry where relevant.** If certain rules depend on the stereochemistry of the molecule (e.g., α-amino acids with specific configurations), include stereochemical specifications in the SMARTS patterns or adjust the matching logic to account for stereoisomers.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Improve exception handling and logging.** Enhance the code to include detailed exception handling and logging for debugging purposes. When a substructure match fails or an error occurs, the code should provide informative messages to help identify and resolve issues quickly.

  - **Chemical Features**: An aromatic ring bearing a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and an **aldehyde group (-CHO)** at the ortho or para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups may engage in **side reactions** or interfere with metal coordination, disrupting optimal metal-ligand interactions and decreasing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages (-O-) along the chain** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules containing **ether linkages (-O-)** within the aliphatic chain and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms may form **unintended coordination** with metal ions, leading to complexes that interfere with catalytic activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Straight-chain aliphatic acids with a **terminal carboxyl group (-COOH)** and no other functional groups along the chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: These chains provide minimal steric hindrance, allowing efficient **metal-ligand coordination** and enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl **(-OH)**, amino **(-NH₂)**) along the chain** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic acids with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and extra **polar groups** on the chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Additional polar groups can cause **steric hindrance** or form **competing interactions** with metal ions, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups (-SH) directly attached to the aromatic ring** tend to result in **low yield**, while those with thiol groups on aliphatic chains tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (sugar acids) with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)** tend to result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic acids with several **hydroxyl groups (-OH)** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional **hydrogen bonding** and potential **coordination sites**, stabilizing metal complexes.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains where many hydrogen atoms are replaced with **fluorine atoms**, along with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorination increases **hydrophobicity** and can reduce effective **metal-ligand coordination** due to altered electronic properties.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with acylated or blocked amino groups (forming amide bonds)** tend to result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group (-NH₂)** is modified to form an **amide linkage (-CONH-)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Acylation reduces available **coordination sites**, weakening interactions with metal centers and decreasing catalytic effectiveness.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with multiple methoxy groups (-OCH₃) on the aromatic ring** tend to result in **high yield**, while those with single methoxy groups may result in **variable yields**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and one or more **methoxy groups (-OCH₃)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple methoxy groups can enhance **electron donation**, potentially increasing **metal coordination** if properly positioned.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
    - **Variable Yield**: Compounds with fewer methoxy groups

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with fused nitrogen-containing rings** may result in **low yield** due to **steric hindrance** affecting metal coordination.

  - **Chemical Features**: Complex fused aromatic systems with **nitrogen atoms** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Bulky structures can hinder effective **metal-ligand interactions**, reducing catalytic performance.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 1 (α-amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups)**: The code's SMARTS pattern for the amino acid backbone (`'[NX3;H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`) is too restrictive and may not match all α-amino acids. It requires a very specific arrangement that might miss valid amino acids due to stereochemistry or slight variations. Additionally, the method for identifying the side-chain carboxyl group may not effectively traverse the side chain. **Improve the SMARTS pattern** for amino acids to be more inclusive, such as `'[NX3][$([CX4H,$(C)])][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`, and adjust the code to correctly identify and traverse the side chain to find a carboxyl group (`-C(=O)O`) attached anywhere on the side chain.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Rule 2 and Rule 3 (Aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents at the para position)**: The SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing (`'c1cc([F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-])ccc1C(=O)[OX1H1]'`) and electron-donating groups (`'c1cc([CH3,OCH3,OH])ccc1C(=O)[OX1H1]'`) at the para position are too specific and may not match due to exact atom typing or missing resonance forms. **Simplify and generalize the SMARTS patterns** to capture more cases, such as using `'c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` combined with checks for substituents in code.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Rule 4 (α-amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains)**: Similar to Suggestion 1, the code may not effectively identify side chains with nitrogen-containing aromatic rings due to limitations in the SMARTS pattern and side-chain traversal. **Update the traversal method** in the code to more accurately capture side chains and **modify the SMARTS patterns** to detect nitrogen-containing aromatic rings (`'[nH]1cccc1'` for indole in tryptophan) and non-nitrogenous rings (`'c1ccccc1'` for phenylalanine).

- **Suggestion 4**: **Rule 5 (Aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups at ortho or para positions)**: The SMARTS pattern (`'c1c([CX3H1](=O))ccc1C(=O)[OX1H1]'`) might not match molecules due to stringent constraints on atom types and positions. **Develop a more flexible SMARTS pattern** that matches aldehyde groups at ortho or para positions, possibly using recursive SMARTS or neighbor queries to specify position.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Rule 6 (Aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages along the chain)**: The current pattern for ether linkages (`'[CX4][OX2][CX4]'`) is too narrow and may not capture all relevant ethers, especially in longer chains or branched molecules. **Expand the SMARTS pattern** to `'[CX4;!$(C=O)][OX2][CX4]'` and ensure that the code checks for multiple occurrences along the aliphatic chain.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Rule 7 and Rule 8 (Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with/without additional polar functional groups)**: The code relies on the presence or absence of polar groups (`'[CX4][OX2H,NX3H2]'`) but may not accurately identify the chain length or the position of these groups. **Implement chain length analysis** to ensure the aliphatic chain is sufficiently long (e.g., 6 or more carbons) and **modify the code to check the positions** of polar groups along the chain, ignoring terminal positions if appropriate.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Rule 10 (Aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles)**: The SMARTS pattern (`'[n][c]C(=O)[OX1H1]'`) might not match all relevant heterocycles due to specific atom connectivity. **Generalize the SMARTS pattern** to match various nitrogen heterocycles attached to carboxylic acids, such as `'[nH0]1cccc1C(=O)[OX1H1]'` or use a more inclusive pattern.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Rule 11 (Polyhydroxy carboxylic acids)**: The SMARTS pattern (`'[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4](C(=O)[OX1H1])'`) may not match due to stereo centers or additional hydroxyl groups. **Adjust the pattern** to allow for varying numbers of hydroxyl groups and consider using recursive SMARTS to match sugars more effectively.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Rule 13 (Amino acids with acylated amino groups)**: The code checks for both the amino acid backbone and acylated amino groups separately, which might miss cases where the amino group is acylated. **Ensure the acylated amino group is correctly associated with the amino acid backbone** in the molecule by modifying the code and **update the SMARTS patterns** to reflect acylated amino groups in the context of amino acids.

- **Suggestion 10**: **General Implementation Improvements**: 
  - **Verify Molecule Parsing**: Ensure all SMILES strings are correctly parsed into molecules, handling stereochemistry and ionization states.
  - **Improve Substructure Matching**: Use more robust matching functions that consider tautomers, resonance structures, and stereochemistry when necessary.
  - **Check for Multiple Matches**: Modify the code to handle multiple matching substructures within a molecule, especially when the presence or absence of certain groups affects the rule outcome.
  - **Add Debugging Output**: Include logging or print statements in the code to indicate which molecules are matching which SMARTS patterns during execution for easier troubleshooting.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance:**

The current set of rules demonstrates an improvement in both **confidence** and **lift** compared to the previous metrics. Specifically, the **average training confidence** has increased from approximately **58.74%** in the previous iteration to **67.89%** in the current rules. This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, there is a higher probability that the rule predictions are correct.

Similarly, the **average training lift** has risen from about **1.13** to **1.36**, suggesting that the rules are more effective at predicting outcomes than random chance. A lift greater than 1 signifies that the presence of the rule condition increases the likelihood of the rule prediction, which is a positive indicator of rule quality.

However, it's important to note that the **average training support** has decreased significantly from **17.56%** to **3.79%**. This means that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. While the rules are more precise (as indicated by higher confidence and lift), they cover fewer instances, potentially limiting their practical applicability.

**Determination of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

The increase in confidence and lift suggests that the current rules are honing in on more specific patterns within the data, possibly approaching a local optimum in terms of accuracy for those instances. However, the substantial reduction in support implies that the rules may have become too specialized, capturing niche cases rather than general trends.

Given that we do not have test metrics for the current iteration, it's challenging to assess the generalizability of these rules to unseen data. The lack of test confidence and lift could mean that the current high performance is due to overfitting on the training dataset.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

To enhance the current rules further, consider the following approaches:

1. **Increase Rule Generalization:**
   - **Merge Similar Rules:** Identify and combine rules that share common features or underlying principles to increase support without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
   - **Broaden Rule Conditions:** Adjust the specificity of certain rule conditions to encompass a wider range of data points, thereby increasing support.

2. **Balance Precision and Coverage:**
   - Aim for a balance between rule precision (confidence and lift) and coverage (support). Strive to develop rules that maintain high confidence and lift while also applying to a larger portion of the dataset.
   - Monitor the trade-off between generalization and precision to avoid overfitting.

3. **Validate with Test Metrics:**
   - Evaluate the current rules on a separate test dataset to obtain test confidence and lift metrics. This will provide insight into the rules' performance on unseen data and help assess their generalizability.
   - Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules are robust across different subsets of the data.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Continue iterating on the rule development process, using insights from the test metrics to guide adjustments.
   - Experiment with introducing new features or redefining existing ones to capture additional relevant patterns in the data.

**Conclusion:**

While the current rules exhibit improved confidence and lift, the decreased support suggests that they may be too narrowly focused. To avoid potential overfitting and enhance their practical utility, it's advisable to refine the rules to increase support while maintaining strong confidence and lift. Incorporating test metrics in the evaluation process will also be crucial for ensuring that the rules perform well on new, unseen data. Further iterations, guided by these considerations, are recommended to optimize the balance between rule precision and applicability.

ML Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation Set and Train Set:**

The current iteration shows a **5-fold validation accuracy of 51.43%**, which is a significant decrease from the **previous validation accuracies of around 76%** and test accuracies ranging from **62.5% to 75%**. This decline indicates that the **current set of rules is less effective** in predicting the catalyst loading compared to previous iterations. The reduced accuracy suggests potential issues with the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen validation data.

**Analysis Based on the SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

Reviewing the SHAP analysis for the validation set, we observe the following patterns:

1. **Consistent Underprediction of High Experimental Loadings:**
   - For several molecules (e.g., `C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`, `C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O`, `C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O`), the **predicted loading is low** while the **experimental value is high**.
   - In these cases, **Rule 9 consistently has a negative SHAP value**, indicating that it is **contributing to the underestimation** of the loading.

2. **Negative SHAP Values from Rule 9:**
   - **Rule 9 SHAP value for high loading** is **-0.002747** for molecules with low predicted and high experimental loadings.
   - This negative value suggests that **Rule 9 is influencing the model to predict lower loadings** for these molecules, which is contradictory to the experimental observations.

3. **Lack of Overpredicted Loadings:**
   - There are fewer instances where the **predicted loading is high** and the **experimental value is low**. This imbalance indicates that the model is more prone to underpredict than overpredict.

**Evaluation of Current Rules Effectiveness:**

1. **Effectiveness Assessment:**
   - The **current rules are not sufficiently capturing the key features** that determine high catalyst loadings, as evidenced by the decreased accuracy and systematic underprediction.
   - **Rule 9, in particular, seems to be misclassifying molecules**, leading to incorrect predictions.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Analysis:**
   - The **significant drop in validation accuracy** suggests that the model may be **underfitting**. It is not learning the underlying patterns in the data effectively.
   - The **consistency of errors across multiple molecules** implies that the rules may not be flexible or comprehensive enough to generalize well.

3. **Discrepancies Identification:**
   - The **negative SHAP values of Rule 9** in underpredicted instances highlight that **Rule 9 is potentially problematic**.
   - Since **Rule 9 is contributing to the model predicting low loading when the experimental value is high**, it requires re-evaluation.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The decrease in accuracy compared to previous iterations suggests that the **current modifications to the rules have not led to improvement**.
   - This may indicate that the model has reached a **local minimum** in performance, and further iterations with the same approach might not yield better results without significant changes.

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- The SHAP analysis points to **Rule 9** as a significant factor in the underestimation of catalyst loadings.
- The **consistent negative impact** of Rule 9 across multiple molecules suggests that its current formulation is **not accurately representing the chemical properties** that lead to high catalyst loading.
- There may be **other relevant features or exceptions** not covered by Rule 9 that are important for these molecules.

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Rule 9 to Address Underestimated Loadings:**
   - **Reevaluate and potentially split Rule 9** into more specific sub-rules to distinguish between different types of thiol-containing modifiers.
   - **Adjust the criteria** to ensure that molecules with **thiol groups on aliphatic chains**, which tend to result in **high yield**, are not misclassified.
   - **Incorporate additional chemical features** that may be influencing the catalyst loading in these cases, such as the **position of the thiol group** or **interaction with other functional groups**.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
   - **Identify and modify any other rules** that consistently contribute negative SHAP values leading to underprediction.
   - **Ensure that the rules are not overly restrictive** and allow for exceptions where applicable.

3. **Enhance Generalization to Address Underfitting:**
   - **Introduce new rules or modify existing ones** to capture additional chemical features influencing catalyst loading.
   - **Expand the dataset** if possible to include a more diverse set of molecules, which can help the model learn a broader range of patterns.
   - **Consider incorporating machine learning models** that can capture nonlinear relationships or interactions between features.

4. **Use Insights from SHAP Analysis to Refine Rules:**
   - **Analyze molecules with discrepancies** between predicted and experimental values to identify patterns not covered by current rules.
   - **Iteratively test and validate changes to the rules**, monitoring the impact on validation accuracy and SHAP values.
   - **Avoid overfitting to SHAP values**; instead, use them as a guide to **improve the logical consistency and coverage** of the rules.

5. **Reassess the Definitions and Scope of Other Rules:**
   - **Review other rules** to ensure they are correctly capturing the intended chemical features without unintended side effects.
   - **Clarify any ambiguous rule definitions** to prevent misclassification of molecules.

6. **Consider the Addition of New Descriptors or Features:**
   - **Incorporate additional descriptors**, such as electronic properties, steric factors, or solvent effects, that may influence catalyst loading.
   - **Utilize computational chemistry tools** to calculate properties that can enhance the feature matrix.

7. **Evaluate the Need for Further Iterations:**
   - Given the current performance, **more iterations may be necessary** to refine the rules and improve the model.
   - **Set milestones** to assess progress after implementing changes, ensuring that modifications are leading to tangible improvements.

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules appears to be insufficient in accurately predicting catalyst loading, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy and consistent underprediction of high experimental loadings. **Rule 9, in particular, requires immediate attention and refinement**. By carefully adjusting the problematic rules and enhancing the model's ability to generalize, we can improve the predictive performance. Iterative refinement, guided by insights from SHAP analysis and thorough chemical understanding, is essential for developing an effective model capable of accurate catalyst loading predictions.

**Summary of the Discussions:**

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has shown improvements in **confidence** and **lift**, indicating a higher probability of accurate predictions when the rules apply. However, there is a significant decrease in **support**, meaning the rules now cover a smaller portion of the dataset. This reduction suggests that the rules have become too specific, possibly limiting their practical utility.

The **validation accuracy** has decreased notably to **51.43%**, down from previous accuracies around **76%**, indicating that the model's ability to generalize has diminished. The **SHAP analysis** reveals that **Rule 9** is consistently contributing negative values, leading to underprediction of catalyst loading for molecules where the experimental yield is high. This suggests that Rule 9 may be misclassified or overly restrictive.

**Directions to Optimize the Current Rules:**

To improve the performance of the rules and address the identified issues, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Refine Rule 9:**

   - **Reevaluate Rule 9's Criteria:** Split Rule 9 into more specific sub-rules to differentiate between thiol-containing modifiers that lead to high yield and those that do not.
   - **Adjust SMARTS Patterns:** Modify the substructure patterns to accurately identify thiol groups on aliphatic chains versus aromatic rings.
   - **Include Additional Chemical Context:** Consider the position of the thiol group and its interaction with other functional groups within the molecule.

2. **Generalize Overly Specific Rules:**

   - **Merge Similar Rules:** Identify rules with overlapping features and combine them to increase support without substantially reducing confidence.

      - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic ring with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and a **thiol group (-SH)** directly attached to the ring.

      - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aromatic thiols may strongly bind to metal centers, causing **catalyst poisoning** and reducing catalytic activity.

      - **Example**:
        - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

      - **SMARTS Pattern**: `c[S][$(C(=O)[O-])]` (Aromatic ring with thiol group and carboxyl group)

    - **Rule 9b**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups (-SH) on aliphatic chains** tend to result in **high yield**.

      - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chain with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and a **thiol group (-SH)** on the chain.

      - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aliphatic thiols can enhance **metal coordination** without inhibiting active sites, improving catalytic performance.

      - **Example**:
        - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

      - **SMARTS Pattern**: `[C;!$(C=O)][SH]` (Aliphatic carbon with attached thiol group)

  - **Adjust SMARTS Patterns** to accurately reflect these distinctions and ensure correct substructure matching during molecule parsing.

- **Advice 2**: **Generalize Overly Specific Rules to Increase Support**

  - **Broaden the Scope of Existing Rules**:

    - **Rule 1**: Expand to include **α-amino acids with side-chain polar groups** (e.g., **hydroxyl (-OH)**, **thiol (-SH)**), as these can also enhance **metal coordination** through additional coordination sites.

      - **Revised Chemical Features**: Molecules featuring an **α-amino group (-NH₂)** and a **side-chain polar group** capable of coordinating with metal centers.

      - **Examples**:
        - **(2S)-2-amino-3-hydroxypropanoic acid** (Serine)
        - **(2S)-2-amino-3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Cysteine)

    - **Rule 14**: Modify to include modifiers with **one or more methoxy groups (-OCH₃)**, not just multiple, as methoxy groups can influence electron density and metal coordination.

      - **Revised Rule**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups (-OCH₃) on the aromatic ring** tend to result in **variable to high yield** depending on positioning.

  - **Simplify SMARTS Patterns**:

    - Create more inclusive patterns that capture a wider range of relevant molecules without compromising the rule's chemical rationale.

    - **Example**: For methoxy groups on aromatic rings, use `[cH][c](O[C])[c]` to match both mono- and dimethoxy-substituted aromatics.

- **Advice 3**: **Create New Rules to Cover Unaccounted Chemical Features**

  - **Introduce a New Rule for Amino-Substituted Aromatic Carboxylic Acids**:

    - **Rule 16**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups (-NH₂) at the para position** tend to result in **high yield**.

      - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic ring with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and an **amino group (-NH₂)** at the para position.

      - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The amino group can act as an additional **coordination site** and can **donate electron density** to the ring, facilitating stronger metal-ligand interactions.

      - **Example**:
        - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

      - **SMARTS Pattern**: `c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O` with a para-substituted amino group, e.g., `[NX3][c]:[c][c]C(=O)[O-]`

- **Advice 4**: **Reassess and Modify Existing Rules with Conflicting Instances**

  - **Review and Modify Rule 3**:

    - **Observation**: Some electron-donating groups like **amino (-NH₂)** can enhance yield due to their ability to coordinate with metal centers.

    - **Action**: Revise Rule 3 to specify that **alkyl and alkoxy groups** decrease yield, while **amino groups** may increase yield.

    - **Revised Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating alkyl or alkoxy groups at the para position** tend to result in **low yield**, whereas those with **amino groups** may result in **high yield**.

  - **Update Rule 14**:

    - **Observation**: Single methoxy groups can sometimes lead to high yield depending on their position and interaction with the metal center.

    - **Action**: Modify Rule 14 to reflect that **the number and position of methoxy groups** influence yield, and consider including positional isomers in the analysis.

- **Advice 5**: **Improve Substructure Matching and Molecule Parsing**

  - **Enhance SMARTS Patterns**:

    - Ensure that SMARTS patterns are accurately capturing the intended functional groups and are not excluding molecules due to overly restrictive syntax.

    - **Example**: Include aromatic heterocycles in patterns where applicable, e.g., `[nH]` for heterocyclic nitrogen.

  - **Verify Molecule Parsing**:

    - Check that molecules are correctly interpreted from their SMILES strings, including stereochemistry and protonation states, to prevent misclassification.

  - **Handle Multiple Matches**:

    - Modify the code to recognize and account for multiple instances of functional groups within a molecule that may collectively influence yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Rebalance the Specificity and Coverage of the Rules**

  - **Avoid Overfitting**:

    - Ensure that rules are not too narrowly defined to a small subset of molecules, which can reduce support and generalizability.

  - **Increase Coverage**:

    - Adjust rules to include additional relevant molecules without significantly compromising confidence.

    - **Example**: For rules concerning aliphatic carboxylic acids, consider varying chain lengths and branching to increase support.

- **Advice 7**: **Leverage SHAP Analysis for Iterative Rule Refinement**

  - **Identify Misclassified Instances**:

    - Use SHAP values to pinpoint molecules where the model's predictions do not align with experimental yields.

  - **Adjust Rules Based on Insights**:

    - Update existing rules or create new ones to account for chemical features present in these misclassified molecules.

    - **Example**: If SHAP analysis shows that modifiers with certain functional groups are consistently mispredicted, consider adding or modifying rules to capture these features.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Additional Chemical Descriptors into the Rules**

  - **Include Electronic Effects**:

    - Consider the impact of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups beyond basic functional groups, accounting for resonance and inductive effects.

  - **Factor in Steric Hindrance**:

    - Include descriptors for steric bulk near coordination sites, which can affect metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Example**: Introduce terms like **ortho-substitution** that can influence steric interactions.

- **Advice 9**: **Validate Updated Rules Using Cross-Validation and Test Sets**

  - **Perform Cross-Validation**:

    - Assess the performance of the updated rules across multiple folds to ensure consistency.

  - **Evaluate on a Separate Test Set**:

    - Test the revised rules on unseen data to measure their predictive accuracy and generalization capability.

  - **Monitor Performance Metrics**:

    - Keep track of validation accuracy, support, confidence, and lift to gauge improvements.

- **Advice 10**: **Consult with Chemical Experts to Confirm and Enhance Rules**

  - **Seek Expert Feedback**:

    - Collaborate with chemists to review the chemical rationale behind each rule and ensure they align with established principles.

  - **Incorporate Recommendations**:

    - Adjust rules based on expert insights, particularly for complex cases or exceptions not easily captured by automated methods.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Coverage for Rules with Limited Data Points**

  Several rules have limited coverage due to being supported by only one data point. Specifically, **Rule 7**, **Rule 8**, **Rule 9**, **Rule 11**, **Rule 13**, **Rule 14**, and **Rule 15** lack sufficient examples to validate their reliability. To improve these rules:

  - **Collect Additional Data**: Seek out more modifiers that fit the criteria of these rules and test their yield outcomes. Expanding the dataset will strengthen the rules' validity.
  - **Merge Similar Rules**: Combine rules that share overlapping chemical features or underlying properties to create more comprehensive rules with broader coverage. For example, rules concerning steric hindrance or electronic effects can be unified.

- **Advice 2**: **Combine and Refine Rules for Clarity and Efficiency**

  Some rules address similar concepts and could be merged to reduce redundancy and enhance clarity:

  - **Merge Rules on Aromatic Substituents**: **Rule 2** and **Rule 3** both discuss the impact of substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids. Consolidate them into a single rule that contrasts the effects of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) on yield.
  - **Unify Rules on Amino Acid Modifiers**: **Rule 1**, **Rule 4** (second part), and **Rule 10** focus on amino acids with specific side chains. Combining these rules can provide a clearer guideline on how different side chains influence yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Clarify Ambiguous Terms and Chemical Features**

  Ensure that all rules use precise and unambiguous language:

  - **Define "Large Steric Bulk"**: In **Rule 13**, specify what constitutes large steric bulk by mentioning particular substituents or providing steric parameters.
  - **Specify Functional Group Positions**: For **Rule 14**, indicate the exact positions of methoxy groups on the aromatic ring to clarify how they affect yield.
  - **Standardize Chemical Terminology**: Use consistent terms for functional groups and chemical features across all rules to prevent confusion.

- **Advice 4**: **Strengthen Physical-Chemical Justifications**

  Enhance the underlying explanations in the rules:

  - **Provide Quantitative Data**: Where possible, include quantitative measures such as pKa values, steric parameters, or coordination numbers to support the physical-chemical properties.
  - **Highlight Mechanistic Insights**: Elaborate on how specific functional groups interact with the metal center at a molecular level, explaining the effect on catalyst performance.

- **Advice 5**: **Prioritize High-Coverage and High-Impact Rules**

  Focus on rules that significantly impact the reaction yield and are supported by multiple data points:

  - **Emphasize Robust Rules**: Rules like **Rule 1**, **Rule 2**, **Rule 3**, **Rule 4**, **Rule 5**, **Rule 6**, **Rule 8** (in its revised form), and **Rule 10** have good coverage and strong physical-chemical bases. Prioritize these in the rule set.
  - **Reassess Less Impactful Rules**: Evaluate whether rules with minimal data support, such as **Rule 15**, contribute meaningfully to the predictions or if they should be omitted or merged.

- **Advice 6**: **Expand the Dataset for Better Rule Validation**

  A larger dataset will improve rule reliability:

  - **Include Diverse Modifiers**: Test additional modifiers with varying structures that fit or challenge the existing rules.
  - **Document Negative Results**: Include modifiers that do not fit any current rules to identify new patterns or necessary rule adjustments.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Machine Learning for Rule Optimization**

  Utilize computational tools to refine the rules:

  - **Chemical Informatics Tools**: Use software to analyze the dataset for patterns that may not be immediately apparent, suggesting new rules or modifications.
  - **Predictive Modeling**: Create models that can predict yield outcomes based on modifier structures, which can help validate and adjust the rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Include Stereochemistry Considerations if Relevant**

  If stereochemistry affects the reaction outcome:

  - **Specify Stereoisomers**: Indicate whether the configuration (e.g., R or S) of chiral centers in the modifiers influences yield.
  - **Adjust Rules Accordingly**: Modify rules to account for stereochemical effects, enhancing their predictive power.

- **Advice 9**: **Review and Validate Rules with Experimental Collaboration**

  Work closely with experimentalists:

  - **Experimental Verification**: Confirm the rules by conducting reactions using modifiers that test the boundaries of the rules.
  - **Iterative Refinement**: Use experimental results to continuously refine and validate the rules.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and provides adequate property insight about acylated amino acids resulting in low yield due to blocked coordination sites. It is supported by at least two data points, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is somewhat vague regarding what constitutes a "bulky substituent," and its coverage is limited, with potential contradictions (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid shows high yield). The clarity and coverage need improvement for this rule to be reliable.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is based on only one data point, which limits its robustness. While the concept is clear and the property insight is sound, more data are needed for validation to meet the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 lacks clarity due to its conditional language ("can result in high yield, especially if..."), making it difficult to predict outcomes confidently. The rule has limited coverage with only one data point, and the property insight could be more specific.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is complex and lacks sufficient coverage, with only one example supporting it. The clarity is acceptable, but the rule would benefit from more data to confirm its validity and improve its reliability.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with an additional side-chain carboxyl group (-COOH)**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules containing an **α-amino group (-NH₂)** and a **β- or γ-carboxyl group (-COOH)** on the side chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of two carboxyl groups allows for **chelation** with metal ions, forming stable five- or six-membered rings. This enhances the catalyst's stability and activity through strong metal-ligand coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**; those with additional polar functional groups along the chain result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Straight-chain aliphatic acids with a **terminal carboxyl group (-COOH)** and no other substituents.
    - **Low Yield**: Aliphatic acids with **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups along the chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Minimal steric hindrance and hydrophobic chains allow effective **metal-ligand coordination**.
    - **Low Yield**: Additional polar groups may introduce **steric hindrance** or compete with the carboxyl group for metal binding, disrupting catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **Octanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) other than aldehydes at the para position** result in **high yield**, while those with electron-donating groups (EDGs) result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: An aromatic ring with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and a **strong EWG** (e.g., **nitro (-NO₂)**, **halogens**) at the para position.
    - **Low Yield**: An aromatic ring with a **carboxyl group** and an **EDG** (e.g., **methyl (-CH₃)**, **hydroxyl (-OH)**) at the para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the **acidity** of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to **coordinate** with metal ions. This leads to stronger metal-ligand interactions and improved catalytic activity.
    - **Low Yield**: Electron-donating substituents decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal-ligand coordination and reducing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups (-CHO) at the ortho or para positions** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: An aromatic ring bearing a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and an **aldehyde group (-CHO)** at the ortho or para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are susceptible to **oxidation** and may form unstable complexes with metal ions or undergo **side reactions**, interfering with optimal metal-ligand coordination and reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **small, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids** result in **high yield**, whereas those with additional bulky aromatic groups result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Molecules featuring a **mono-cyclic nitrogenous heteroaromatic ring** (e.g., **pyridine**, **pyrazole**) with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.
    - **Low Yield**: Molecules with additional aromatic rings or bulky substituents attached to the heterocycle.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen atoms provide additional **coordination sites** for metal ions, enhancing metal-ligand binding and catalyst stability.
    - **Low Yield**: Bulky substituents cause **steric hindrance**, impairing effective coordination with the metal center.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, result in **high yield**, whereas those with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains, like **phenylalanine**, result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **nitrogenous heterocycles** (e.g., **indole ring**).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **non-nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., **phenyl group**).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen atoms in the side chain offer additional **coordination sites**, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of extra coordination sites results in weaker metal-ligand binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)** along with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**, such as **polyhydroxy aliphatic acids (sugar acids)**, result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules with several **hydroxyl groups** and a **carboxyl group**, resembling sugar acids.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide extra **hydrogen bonding** and **coordination sites** for metal ions, forming stable complexes and enhancing catalytic activity through effective chelation.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages (-O-) along the chain** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules featuring **ether linkages (-O-)** within the aliphatic chain and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms may form unintended **coordinate bonds** with metal ions, leading to inactive complexes that interfere with catalytic activity. The flexibility of the ether linkages can also disrupt optimal metal-ligand coordination.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains where multiple hydrogen atoms are replaced with **fluorine atoms**, accompanied by a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorination increases **electronegativity** and **hydrophobicity**, reducing the carboxyl group's ability to coordinate with metal ions. Strong **C-F bonds** also decrease electron density available for metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **thiol groups (-SH)** on **aliphatic chains** result in **high yield**, while those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Aliphatic acids with **thiol groups (-SH)** on the side chain.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic acids with **thiol groups** attached directly to the ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Thiol groups on aliphatic chains can form **soft acid-base interactions** with metal ions without causing catalyst poisoning.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or irreversibly to metal centers, leading to **catalyst deactivation**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **acylated amino acids (with blocked amino groups)** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group (-NH₂)** is modified to form an **amide linkage (-CONH-)**, such as through **acetylation**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Acylation of the amino group removes a potential **coordination site** for metal ions, reducing binding affinity to the metal center and weakening catalyst performance.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents directly attached to the ring** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with large or bulky groups attached to the ring, especially near the **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: **Steric hindrance** from bulky substituents can obstruct effective **metal-ligand coordination**, impairing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **keto groups (=O) adjacent to the carboxylate group** in an aromatic system result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic compounds where a **keto group (=O)** is positioned next to a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**, enabling **bidentate coordination**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Proximity of keto and carboxyl groups allows the molecule to act as a **chelating ligand**, forming stable five-membered rings with metal ions. This enhances metal-ligand interactions and boosts catalytic performance.

  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **methoxy groups (-OCH₃) on the aromatic ring** in addition to other functional groups can result in **high yield**, especially if these enhance electron density and coordination with metal ions.

  - **Chemical Features**: An aromatic ring with multiple **methoxy groups (-OCH₃)** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**, sometimes with additional functional groups that facilitate coordination.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, potentially enhancing **π-backbonding** and **metal-ligand interactions**.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing sulfur**, such as **methionine derivatives**, result in **low yield** if the sulfur is part of a blocked or hindered functional group.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids with **sulfur-containing side chains** where the sulfur is not available for coordination due to steric hindrance or functionalization.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Blocked or sterically hindered sulfur atoms cannot effectively coordinate with metal ions, reducing catalyst activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: *Revise the chain length calculation in Rule 2*. The current implementation counts only carbon atoms connected to exactly two other carbons (`if neighbors.count(6) == 2`), which underestimates the chain length by ignoring terminal carbons. This causes long-chain aliphatic acids like octanoic acid not to match the rule. Instead, use RDKit's `Chem.rdMolDescriptors.CalcExactMolWt` or `Chem.rdmolops.GetMolFrags` to identify the longest continuous carbon chain. Alternatively, utilize a molecular fingerprint or a recursive search to accurately determine the total carbon chain length, including terminal carbons.

- **Suggestion 2**: *Handle low-yield cases in Rule 2 by setting prediction to -1 when polar functional groups are present*. Currently, the rule sets `prediction: 1` but does not assign `-1` to molecules with additional polar groups, as specified in the language description. Modify the rule to include `prediction: -1` when any of the `exclude_patterns` (hydroxyl, amino, thiol groups, ether linkages) are present. You might split Rule 2 into two separate rules: one for high yield (without polar groups) and one for low yield (with polar groups).

- **Suggestion 3**: *Improve pattern specificity for para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids in Rule 3*. The SMARTS pattern `'[c][c][c][c][c][c]'` does not guarantee para substitution relative to the carboxyl group. Replace it with a more precise pattern that ensures the EWG is at the para position to the carboxyl group, such as `'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O'` with a variable substituent at the para position. Use atom mapping or recursive SMARTS to specify the relative positions of the substituents.

- **Suggestion 4**: *Specify the positions of aldehyde groups in Rule 4*. The current code checks for an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid on an aromatic ring but does not enforce that the aldehyde is at the ortho or para position relative to the carboxyl group. Modify the SMARTS pattern to ensure the aldehyde group is ortho or para to the carboxyl group, perhaps using SMARTS like `'c1ccc(C=O)cc1C(=O)O'` for para position and adjusting accordingly for ortho.

- **Suggestion 5**: *Adjust the exclude patterns in Rule 5 to allow for the nitrogenous heterocycle while excluding additional bulky aromatic groups*. The current `exclude_patterns` include any aromatic ring, which inadvertently excludes molecules needed for a positive match. Instead, adjust the exclude pattern to specifically exclude molecules with additional aromatic rings beyond the heterocyclic ring. Use a count of aromatic rings and set `counts: {'aromatic_ring': 1}` to allow one aromatic ring (the heterocycle) but exclude molecules with more than one.

- **Suggestion 6**: *Refine Rule 6 to ensure the nitrogen-containing aromatic ring is part of the amino acid's side chain*. The current implementation may incorrectly match molecules where the nitrogenous aromatic ring is not connected as a side chain to the α-carbon. Modify the SMARTS pattern to connect the nitrogen-containing aromatic ring directly to the side chain of the amino acid, perhaps by extending `amino_acid_pattern` to include a side chain connected to an aromatic nitrogen heterocycle.

- **Suggestion 7**: *Update the hydroxyl group count in Rule 7 to more accurately represent polyhydroxy acids*. Requiring only two hydroxyl groups may cause non-polyhydroxy acids to match. Increase the `counts` requirement for `hydroxyl_group` to `3` or more, aligning with the typical structure of sugar acids like gluconic acid, which have multiple hydroxyl groups.

- **Suggestion 8**: *Enhance Rule 8 to target ether linkages specifically along aliphatic chains*. The current pattern may match any ether linkage, including those not along an aliphatic chain. Modify the `ether_linkage` SMARTS to `'[C;$(*C)][O;X2][C;$(*C)]'` to ensure the ether is within an aliphatic context. Additionally, verify that the molecule is an aliphatic carboxylic acid by ensuring the absence of aromatic rings.

- **Suggestion 9**: *Strengthen the fluorination criteria in Rule 9*. Counting at least three fluorine atoms may not adequately represent "heavily fluorinated" compounds. Increase the fluorine count threshold in `counts` to, for example, `counts: {'[F]': 5}`. Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that matches perfluoroalkyl chains, such as `'[C](F)(F)[C,F]'` repeated to capture longer perfluorinated chains.

- **Suggestion 10**: *Differentiate between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing acids in Rule 10*. Presently, the rule excludes any molecule containing an aromatic ring, potentially excluding aliphatic acids with both an aliphatic thiol and an aromatic ring elsewhere. Adjust the `exclude_patterns` to specifically exclude thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings using SMARTS like `'[c]-[S;X2H]'` and include patterns to confirm the thiol group is on an aliphatic chain, such as `'[C;!R][S;X2H]'`.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with an additional side-chain carboxyl group (-COOH)**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules containing an **α-amino group (-NH₂)** and a **β- or γ-carboxyl group (-COOH)** on the side chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of two carboxyl groups allows for **chelation** with metal ions, forming stable five- or six-membered rings. This enhances the catalyst's stability and activity through strong metal-ligand coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**; those with additional polar functional groups along the chain result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Straight-chain aliphatic acids with a **terminal carboxyl group (-COOH)** and no other substituents.
    - **Low Yield**: Aliphatic acids with **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups along the chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Minimal steric hindrance and hydrophobic chains allow effective **metal-ligand coordination**.
    - **Low Yield**: Additional polar groups may introduce **steric hindrance** or compete with the carboxyl group for metal binding, disrupting catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **Octanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) other than aldehydes at the para position** result in **high yield**, while those with electron-donating groups (EDGs) result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: An aromatic ring with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and a **strong EWG** (e.g., **nitro (-NO₂)**, **halogens**) at the para position.
    - **Low Yield**: An aromatic ring with a **carboxyl group** and an **EDG** (e.g., **methyl (-CH₃)**, **hydroxyl (-OH)**) at the para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the **acidity** of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to **coordinate** with metal ions. This leads to stronger metal-ligand interactions and improved catalytic activity.
    - **Low Yield**: Electron-donating substituents decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal-ligand coordination and reducing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups (-CHO) at the ortho or para positions** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: An aromatic ring bearing a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and an **aldehyde group (-CHO)** at the ortho or para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are susceptible to **oxidation** and may form unstable complexes with metal ions or undergo **side reactions**, interfering with optimal metal-ligand coordination and reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **small, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids** result in **high yield**, whereas those with additional bulky aromatic groups result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Molecules featuring a **mono-cyclic nitrogenous heteroaromatic ring** (e.g., **pyridine**, **pyrazole**) with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.
    - **Low Yield**: Molecules with additional aromatic rings or bulky substituents attached to the heterocycle.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen atoms provide additional **coordination sites** for metal ions, enhancing metal-ligand binding and catalyst stability.
    - **Low Yield**: Bulky substituents cause **steric hindrance**, impairing effective coordination with the metal center.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, result in **high yield**, whereas those with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains, like **phenylalanine**, result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **nitrogenous heterocycles** (e.g., **indole ring**).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **non-nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., **phenyl group**).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen atoms in the side chain offer additional **coordination sites**, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of extra coordination sites results in weaker metal-ligand binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)** along with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**, such as **polyhydroxy aliphatic acids (sugar acids)**, result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules with several **hydroxyl groups** and a **carboxyl group**, resembling sugar acids.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide extra **hydrogen bonding** and **coordination sites** for metal ions, forming stable complexes and enhancing catalytic activity through effective chelation.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages (-O-) along the chain** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules featuring **ether linkages (-O-)** within the aliphatic chain and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms may form unintended **coordinate bonds** with metal ions, leading to inactive complexes that interfere with catalytic activity. The flexibility of the ether linkages can also disrupt optimal metal-ligand coordination.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains where multiple hydrogen atoms are replaced with **fluorine atoms**, accompanied by a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorination increases **electronegativity** and **hydrophobicity**, reducing the carboxyl group's ability to coordinate with metal ions. Strong **C-F bonds** also decrease electron density available for metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **thiol groups (-SH)** on **aliphatic chains** result in **high yield**, while those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Aliphatic acids with **thiol groups (-SH)** on the side chain.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic acids with **thiol groups** attached directly to the ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Thiol groups on aliphatic chains can form **soft acid-base interactions** with metal ions without causing catalyst poisoning.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or irreversibly to metal centers, leading to **catalyst deactivation**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **acylated amino acids (with blocked amino groups)** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group (-NH₂)** is modified to form an **amide linkage (-CONH-)**, such as through **acetylation**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Acylation of the amino group removes a potential **coordination site** for metal ions, reducing binding affinity to the metal center and weakening catalyst performance.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents directly attached to the ring** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with large or bulky groups attached to the ring, especially near the **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: **Steric hindrance** from bulky substituents can obstruct effective **metal-ligand coordination**, impairing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **keto groups (=O) adjacent to the carboxylate group** in an aromatic system result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic compounds where a **keto group (=O)** is positioned next to a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**, enabling **bidentate coordination**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Proximity of keto and carboxyl groups allows the molecule to act as a **chelating ligand**, forming stable five-membered rings with metal ions. This enhances metal-ligand interactions and boosts catalytic performance.

  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **methoxy groups (-OCH₃) on the aromatic ring** in addition to other functional groups can result in **high yield**, especially if these enhance electron density and coordination with metal ions.

  - **Chemical Features**: An aromatic ring with multiple **methoxy groups (-OCH₃)** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**, sometimes with additional functional groups that facilitate coordination.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, potentially enhancing **π-backbonding** and **metal-ligand interactions**.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing sulfur**, such as **methionine derivatives**, result in **low yield** if the sulfur is part of a blocked or hindered functional group.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids with **sulfur-containing side chains** where the sulfur is not available for coordination due to steric hindrance or functionalization.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Blocked or sterically hindered sulfur atoms cannot effectively coordinate with metal ions, reducing catalyst activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 1** - The SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 does not correctly match α-amino acids with an additional side-chain carboxyl group (-COOH), such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid. The current pattern:
  ```
  [NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]
  ```
  misses the side-chain carboxyl group. To accurately capture α-amino acids with an additional side-chain carboxyl group, revise the pattern to:
  ```
  [NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]
  ```
  This modification ensures that the side chain contains a carboxyl group attached to the β or γ carbon.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Rule 2** - The SMARTS pattern for high yield in Rule 2 does not correctly match long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids, such as octanoic acid. The pattern:
  ```
  [CH3][CH2]{4,}[C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]
  ```
  may not be recognized properly by RDKit due to the `{4,}` repetition syntax. Replace `{4,}` with explicit SMILES notation. A corrected pattern could be:
  ```
  [CH3][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]
  ```
  for octanoic acid (eight carbons). Alternatively, use the wildcard for variable chain lengths:
  ```
  [CH3][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]
  ```
  For the exclude patterns, the current patterns are too general and may incorrectly exclude molecules. Adjust the exclude patterns to specifically target aliphatic chains with additional polar functional groups:
  - For hydroxyl groups along the chain:
    ```
    [CH2][CH](O)[CH2]
    ```
  - For amino groups along the chain:
    ```
    [CH2][CH](N)[CH2]
    ```

- **Suggestion 3**: **Rule 3** - The SMARTS patterns in Rule 3 do not correctly differentiate between electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) on aromatic carboxylic acids. The current patterns may not effectively match the substituents at the para position. Update the patterns to specifically identify EWGs and exclude EDGs:
  - Pattern for high yield (EWGs other than aldehydes at the para position):
    ```
    c1cc([C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1[EWG]
    ```
    Where `[EWG]` can be:
    ```
    [F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-]
    ```
  - Exclude pattern for aldehydes and EDGs at the para position:
    ```
    c1cc([C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])cc[cH1,NH2,OCH3,CH3]1
    ```
  Ensure that the patterns accurately reflect the positions and types of substituents.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Rule 5** - The patterns for Rule 5 do not correctly identify small, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids nor exclude those with bulky aromatic groups. The current pattern:
  ```
  [n]1[c][c][c][c]1[C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]
  ```
  may not match all relevant heterocycles. Expand the patterns to include other nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyrazole:
  ```
  [nH]1ncccc1[C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]
  ```
  For the exclude patterns, use:
  ```
  [c][c]c1ncccc1[C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]
  ```
  to exclude molecules with additional bulky aromatic groups attached to the heterocycle.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Rule 6** - The SMARTS patterns for Rule 6 do not accurately distinguish between amino acids with nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains. Update the pattern for high yield (nitrogen-containing side chains) to:
  ```
  [NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX4][CH2][c]1c([nH])ccc1
  ```
  for tryptophan-like structures. For the exclude pattern (non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains), use:
  ```
  [NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX4][CH2][c]1ccccc1
  ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **Rule 7** - The pattern for Rule 7 may be too general and not match sugar acids effectively. Enhance the pattern to require at least three hydroxyl groups along with a terminal carboxyl group:
  ```
  [CH2OH][CHOH][CHOH][CH(OH)][C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]
  ```
  This pattern more accurately represents gluconic acid and similar sugar acids.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Rule 8** - The SMARTS pattern for Rule 8 may not match all aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages. Modify the pattern to include variable chain lengths and positions of ether linkages:
  ```
  [#6][OX2][#6][OX2][#6][OX2][#6][C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]
  ```
  Ensure that the pattern captures molecules with multiple ether linkages along the chain.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Rule 9** - The pattern for heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids should account for varying chain lengths and degrees of fluorination. Update the pattern to:
  ```
  [CF3][CF2][CF2][C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]
  ```
  or use recursive SMARTS to match multiple CF2 units:
  ```
  [CF3]([CF2]*)[C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]
  ```

- **Suggestion 9**: **Rule 10** - Ensure that the pattern for high yield (aliphatic thiol acids) correctly matches the thiol group on an aliphatic chain:
  ```
  [#6][CH2][SH][C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]
  ```
  Update the exclude pattern to more specifically exclude thiols attached directly to an aromatic ring:
  ```
  [c][SX2H]
  ```

- **Suggestion 10**: **Rule 11** - The pattern for acylated amino acids may not match all such derivatives. Improve the pattern by accounting for acyl groups attached to the amino nitrogen:
  ```
  [NX3][CX3](=O)[#6][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[NX3]
  ```
  This captures amino acids where the amino group is acylated.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Rule 12** - The pattern for bulky substituents on the aromatic ring should be more specific. Revise the pattern to:
  ```
  c1c([C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1[c;R]([!H])[!#1]
  ```
  This pattern matches aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky non-hydrogen substituents on the ring.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Rule 13** - To ensure that keto groups adjacent to the carboxylate group are matched, refine the pattern to:
  ```
  c1cc(=O)c([C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])cc1
  ```
  This pattern captures molecules like 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Rule 14** - The pattern for methoxy groups on the aromatic ring needs adjustment. Use:
  ```
  c1cc(OC)c(C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1
  ```
  This pattern ensures that methoxy groups are present on the aromatic ring along with the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Rule 15** - The pattern for α-amino acids with blocked or hindered sulfur-containing side chains should be updated to accurately reflect methionine derivatives. Modify the pattern to:
  ```
  [NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX4][CH2][S][CX3](=O)[*]
  ```
  This pattern matches amino acids like N-acetylmethionine where the sulfur is involved in an acyl group.

- **Suggestion 15**: For all rules, validate each SMARTS pattern individually using known matching and non-matching molecules to ensure accuracy. Test the patterns against the provided SMILES list and adjust as necessary to correct any mismatches.

- **Suggestion 16**: Consider using RDKit's `Chem.MolFromSmarts` method to check the validity of each SMARTS pattern. Invalid or improperly formatted SMARTS can lead to incorrect matching or errors during execution.

- **Suggestion 17**: In the code, ensure that when exclude patterns are matched, the program correctly assigns the `alternative_prediction` rather than defaulting to zero. Verify that the logic flow correctly handles include and exclude pattern matching.

- **Suggestion 18**: Provide more detailed comments or documentation within the code for each SMARTS pattern to explain the intended match. This will help in verifying the patterns against the natural language rules and in future maintenance.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with an additional side-chain carboxyl group (-COOH)**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules containing an **α-amino group (-NH₂)** and a **β- or γ-carboxyl group (-COOH)** on the side chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of two carboxyl groups allows for **chelation** with metal ions, forming stable five- or six-membered rings. This enhances the catalyst's stability and activity through strong metal-ligand coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

---

      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups (-CHO) at the ortho or para positions** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: An aromatic ring bearing a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and an **aldehyde group (-CHO)** at the ortho or para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups are susceptible to **oxidation** and may form unstable complexes with metal ions or undergo **side reactions**, interfering with optimal metal-ligand coordination and reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **small, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids** result in **high yield**, whereas those with additional bulky aromatic groups result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Molecules featuring a **mono-cyclic nitrogenous heteroaromatic ring** (e.g., **pyridine**, **pyrazole**) with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.
    - **Low Yield**: Molecules with additional aromatic rings or bulky substituents attached to the heterocycle.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen atoms provide additional **coordination sites** for metal ions, enhancing metal-ligand binding and catalyst stability.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, result in **high yield**, whereas those with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains, like **phenylalanine**, result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **nitrogenous heterocycles** (e.g., **indole ring**).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **non-nitrogenous aromatic rings** (e.g., **phenyl group**).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Nitrogen atoms in the side chain offer additional **coordination sites**, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of extra coordination sites results in weaker metal-ligand binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)** along with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**, such as **polyhydroxy aliphatic acids (sugar acids)**, result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules with several **hydroxyl groups** and a **carboxyl group**, resembling sugar acids.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide extra **hydrogen bonding** and **coordination sites** for metal ions, forming stable complexes and enhancing catalytic activity through effective chelation.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages (-O-) along the chain** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules featuring **ether linkages (-O-)** within the aliphatic chain and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygen atoms may form unintended **coordinate bonds** with metal ions, leading to inactive complexes that interfere with catalytic activity. The flexibility of the ether linkages can also disrupt optimal metal-ligand coordination.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains where multiple hydrogen atoms are replaced with **fluorine atoms**, accompanied by a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Fluorination increases **electronegativity** and **hydrophobicity**, reducing the carboxyl group's ability to coordinate with metal ions. Strong **C-F bonds** also decrease electron density available for metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **thiol groups (-SH)** on **aliphatic chains** result in **high yield**, while those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Aliphatic acids with **thiol groups (-SH)** on the side chain.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic acids with **thiol groups** attached directly to the ring.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Thiol groups on aliphatic chains can form **soft acid-base interactions** with metal ions without causing catalyst poisoning.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or irreversibly to metal centers, leading to **catalyst deactivation**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **acylated amino acids (with blocked amino groups)** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group (-NH₂)** is modified to form an **amide linkage (-CONH-)**, such as through **acetylation**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Acylation of the amino group removes a potential **coordination site** for metal ions, reducing binding affinity to the metal center and weakening catalyst performance.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents directly attached to the ring** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with large or bulky groups attached to the ring, especially near the **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: **Steric hindrance** from bulky substituents can obstruct effective **metal-ligand coordination**, impairing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **keto groups (=O) adjacent to the carboxylate group** in an aromatic system result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic compounds where a **keto group (=O)** is positioned next to a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**, enabling **bidentate coordination**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Proximity of keto and carboxyl groups allows the molecule to act as a **chelating ligand**, forming stable five-membered rings with metal ions. This enhances metal-ligand interactions and boosts catalytic performance.

  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **methoxy groups (-OCH₃) on the aromatic ring** in addition to other functional groups can result in **high yield**, especially if these enhance electron density and coordination with metal ions.

  - **Chemical Features**: An aromatic ring with multiple **methoxy groups (-OCH₃)** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**, sometimes with additional functional groups that facilitate coordination.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, potentially enhancing **π-backbonding** and **metal-ligand interactions**.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing sulfur**, such as **methionine derivatives**, result in **low yield** if the sulfur is part of a blocked or hindered functional group.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids with **sulfur-containing side chains** where the sulfur is not available for coordination due to steric hindrance or functionalization.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Blocked or sterically hindered sulfur atoms cannot effectively coordinate with metal ions, reducing catalyst activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Extend Code to Include All Rules**  
  The current code only implements Rules 1 through 5, whereas the provided rules include 15 rules. To fully capture the dataset's features, the code should be updated to implement all the rules (Rules 1 through 15) to ensure a comprehensive transformation from language rules to the feature matrix.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Refine Rule 1 SMARTS to Specify Side-Chain Carboxyl Group Position**  
  For Rule 1, the code checks for an amino acid backbone and at least two carboxylic acid groups but doesn't ensure that the additional carboxyl group is on the side chain at the β or γ position relative to the α-amino group. The code should be updated with SMARTS patterns that specifically match a side-chain carboxyl group at these positions. For example, use a pattern that identifies an α-amino acid with a carboxyl group two or three carbons away from the amino group.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Improve Accuracy of Amino Acid Backbone Matching**  
  The SMARTS pattern for the amino acid backbone (`'[NX3][CH1][CX3](=O)[OX1H0,H1]'`) may not capture all α-amino acids. Consider refining this pattern to ensure it matches α-amino acids accurately, perhaps by including chiral centers or using a more precise description of the backbone.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Specify Chain Length and Saturation in Rule 2**  
  In Rules 2 and 2.1, the pattern for a long aliphatic chain (`'[C]CCCC'`) may match any chain with five or more carbons, including branched or unsaturated chains. To accurately represent straight-chain aliphatic acids, update the pattern to specify unbranched, saturated chains of specific lengths (e.g., use repetitive smarts like `'[CH2]'` repeated for the desired chain length).

- **Suggestion 5**: **Enhance Detection of Polar Functional Groups in Rule 2.1**  
  The code should ensure that in Rule 2.1, polar functional groups like hydroxyl (`-OH`) or amino (`-NH₂`) groups along the chain are detected regardless of their position. Update the patterns to search for these groups anywhere along the chain, not just at specific positions.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Accurately Identify Substituent Positions on Aromatic Rings for Rule 3 and 4**  
  For Rules 3 and 3.1, the code should specify that EWGs or EDGs are at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. Similarly, Rule 4 requires the aldehyde group to be at the ortho or para positions. Update the SMARTS patterns to reflect substituent positions, possibly using SMARTS recursive smarts or ring descriptors.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Expand Lists of EWGs and EDGs**  
  The lists of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) in the code may be incomplete. Expand these lists to include other common substituents as specified in chemical knowledge, such as nitro groups, cyano groups for EWGs, and alkyl groups, methoxy groups for EDGs.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Modify Rule 5 to Accurately Capture Small Nitrogen Heterocycles**  
  The SMARTS pattern for nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids (`'[n][c,N][c,N][c,N][c,N][c,N][C](=O)[O]'`) may be too restrictive or inaccurate. Update this pattern to match common small heterocycles like pyridine or pyrazole with a carboxyl group attached. For example, use `[$([nH1]),n]1ccc(cc1)C(=O)[O]` for pyridine derivatives.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Ensure SMARTS Patterns Reflect Exclusion Criteria Accurately**  
  Review the `exclude_patterns` in each rule to make sure they correctly prevent matching molecules that should not meet the rule criteria. For example, ensure that molecules with bulky substituents are properly excluded in Rule 5 by refining the pattern for bulky aromatic groups.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Validate and Test Each SMARTS Pattern Individually**  
  Before applying the patterns to the full dataset, individually validate each SMARTS pattern against known examples to ensure they match the intended structures. This helps identify any errors or oversights in the pattern definitions.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Incorporate Position-Specific Patterns for Substituents**  
  Use SMARTS annotations that allow for the specification of substituent positions on rings (e.g., ortho, meta, para). For example, use patterns that define the carboxyl and substituent in specific relative positions on the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Handle Functional Group Overlaps and Conflicts**  
  Some molecules may match multiple rules due to overlapping functional groups. Ensure the code has logic to handle such cases appropriately, perhaps by prioritizing certain rules or by allowing multiple rule matches per molecule.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Implement Comprehensive Testing with Known Compounds**  
  Test the code using compounds with known outcomes (e.g., the examples provided in each rule) to verify that the rules are implemented correctly. Adjust the code based on discrepancies found during testing.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Update and Expand SMARTS Definitions for Functional Groups**  
  The SMARTS definitions provided may not cover all necessary functional groups accurately. Review and update these definitions to ensure comprehensive coverage of the functional groups mentioned in the rules.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Add Comments and Documentation to Code**  
  Include comments and documentation within the code to explain the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and how it relates to the corresponding rule. This aids in code maintenance and future updates.

**Observations and Insights**

1. **High-Performing Rules**:

   - **Rules with High Confidence and Lift**:
     - **Rule 6**:
       - Confidence: 0.7890
       - Lift: 1.5783
     - **Rule 8**:
       - Confidence: 0.7796
       - Lift: 1.5649
     - **Rule 4**:
       - Confidence: 0.7083
       - Lift: 1.4293
     - **Rule 3**:
       - Confidence: 0.6819
       - Lift: 1.3488

   These rules demonstrate both high confidence and high lift, indicating that they are not only accurate but also provide valuable insights beyond what is expected by chance.

2. **Overall Metrics**:

   - The overall train confidence and lift are slightly lower than the previous averages. This suggests that while individual rules may perform well, their collective performance does not surpass that of the previous rule set.

3. **Support and Leverage**:

   - **Support**:
     - The overall train support (**0.0653**) is lower than the previous average support ([0.1667, 0.1845]).
     - Lower support indicates that the rules apply to a smaller subset of the data, which may limit their generalizability.

   - **Leverage**:
     - The overall train leverage (**0.0009329**) is significantly lower than the previous leverage values ([0.0289, -0.0041]).
     - Low leverage suggests that the rules do not provide significantly more information than random chance.

4. **Consistency Across Rules**:

   - There is variability in the performance of individual rules.
   - Some rules (e.g., Rule 9) have lower confidence and lift, potentially dragging down the overall metrics.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

Given the current metrics, it appears that improvements have plateaued:

- The average confidence and lift of individual rules are higher than previous averages, but the overall metrics have not improved correspondingly.
- The overall performance is slightly lower than previous iterations.
- The decrease in overall leverage suggests diminishing returns from additional iterations.

**Conclusion**:

- **Local Minimum**: It is likely that the current set of rules has reached a local minimum in terms of performance. Further iterations without significant changes to the approach may not yield substantial improvements.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Focus on High-Performing Rules**:

   - **Amplify High-Confidence Rules**:
     - Prioritize rules with high confidence and lift (e.g., Rules 6, 8, 4, 3).
     - Investigate these rules further to understand why they perform well and if their scope can be expanded.

2. **Refine or Eliminate Low-Performing Rules**:

   - **Re-evaluate Low Confidence and Lift Rules**:
     - Rules with lower confidence and lift (e.g., Rule 9) may not contribute meaningfully.
     - Consider revising these rules or removing them to improve overall metrics.

3. **Increase Support**:

   - **Broaden Rule Applicability**:
     - Modify rules to cover a larger portion of the dataset without sacrificing confidence and lift.
     - Ensure that high-performing rules are not too narrowly defined.

4. **Enhance Rule Specificity and Generalization**:

   - **Balance Specificity and Generalization**:
     - Overly specific rules may have high confidence but low support.
     - Generalizing the rules slightly may increase support and leverage while maintaining acceptable confidence levels.

5. **Analyze Underlying Chemical Features**:

   - **Deeper Chemical Insights**:
     - Re-express rules in terms of fundamental chemical properties that influence catalytic activity.
     - Identify common features among high-yield modifiers that can be included in new or revised rules.

6. **Consider Rule Interactions**:

   - **Rule Synergy**:
     - Investigate if combinations of rules lead to higher performance.
     - Use techniques such as rule pruning or rule combination to optimize the rule set.

7. **Leverage Advanced Modeling Techniques**:

   - **Incorporate Statistical Models**:
     - Utilize regression analysis or machine learning to uncover patterns not captured by the current rules.
     - Validate rules using cross-validation to ensure they generalize well to unseen data.

8. **Iterative Refinement with Feedback**:

   - **Solicit Domain Expert Feedback**:
     - Consult with chemists to validate the practical significance of the rules.
     - Use expert insights to adjust rules for better real-world applicability.

---

**Final Thoughts**

To enhance the performance of the current rules:

- **Strategic Refinement**: Focus on refining high-performing rules and reconsidering or eliminating low-performing ones.
- **Holistic Approach**: Balance the trade-offs between confidence, lift, support, and leverage to optimize the rule set.
- **Innovation in Methodology**: Introduce new methods or perspectives to break out of the local minimum and achieve better results.

By implementing these recommendations, we can improve the predictive power and practical utility of our rules, ultimately advancing our research program's objectives.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the current set of rules yields a 5-fold validation accuracy of **0.6286**, which is comparable to previous accuracies ranging from approximately **0.5143** to **0.76**. The fluctuations in accuracy across iterations suggest that the model's performance has plateaued and may not be improving significantly with the current set of rules. This indicates that the existing rules may not adequately capture the complexity of the data or are potentially causing inconsistent predictions.

**Assessing Overfitting/Underfitting:**

- **Underfitting:** The moderate and stagnant accuracy suggests that the model may be underfitting. The rules may be too general and not capturing important nuances in the data, leading to a lack of improvement in accuracy over iterations.

**Analyzing Discrepancies:**

Upon examining the SHAP analysis feedback for the latest iteration, several key observations emerge:

1. **Underestimations (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - **Molecules:**
     - **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
     - **C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O**
     - **C1=CN=CC=C1CCCC(=O)O**

   - **Observations:**
     - For these molecules, the model predicts **low loading** while the experimental value is **high**.
     - **Rule 5** consistently has **high negative SHAP values** (e.g., **-0.0806**), indicating it significantly contributes to the underestimation.
     - **Rule 6** has **positive SHAP values** but does not offset the negative contribution of Rule 5.

2. **Overestimations (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecules:**
     - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)S**

   - **Observations:**
     - The model predicts **high loading** while the experimental value is **low**.
     - Both **Rule 5** and **Rule 6** have **high positive SHAP values** (e.g., **Rule 5: +0.1757**), contributing to the overestimation.
  
3. **Consistent Misclassifications:**

   - The model shows inconsistent performance with certain molecules, suggesting that **Rule 5** may not be accurately capturing the distinctions between high-yield and low-yield modifiers.

**Interpreting SHAP Values:**

- **Rule 5** (Modifiers that are small, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids result in high yield; those with additional bulky aromatic groups result in low yield) is contributing both positively and negatively to predictions in a way that leads to errors.
  
- **Rule 6** (Modifiers that are α-amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains result in high yield; those with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains result in low yield) also appears to contribute to misclassifications, albeit to a lesser extent.

**Accuracy Improvements:**

- The lack of significant improvement in validation accuracy, coupled with the inconsistencies highlighted by the SHAP analysis, suggests that the current rules are not sufficiently refined and may be causing the model to underperform.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the model's performance and address the identified issues, consider the following strategies:

1. **Refine Rule 5:**

   - **Specificity Enhancement:**
     - **Problem:** Rule 5 is too broadly defined, encompassing a wide variety of nitrogen-containing heterocycles without accounting for important differences.
     - **Solution:** Subdivide Rule 5 to distinguish between different sizes and types of heterocycles, the position of nitrogen atoms, and the presence of substituents.
       - **Example Adjustment:** Specify that only certain types of heterocycles (e.g., five-membered rings with specific substitution patterns) result in high yield.
     - **Expected Outcome:** Reducing the misclassification of molecules like **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N** by ensuring that only truly effective modifiers are classified as high yield by this rule.

   - **Steric Hindrance Consideration:**
     - **Problem:** Bulky substituents near coordination sites may impede effective binding.
     - **Solution:** Incorporate steric factors into the rule, possibly adding a clause that excludes molecules with steric hindrance around the heterocyclic ring.

2. **Adjust Rule 6:**

   - **Side Chain Diversity:**
     - **Problem:** Rule 6 may not account for the full diversity of amino acid side chains and their effects on yield.
     - **Solution:** Expand the rule to include amino acids with other coordinating side chains (e.g., sulfur-containing side chains in cysteine) and clarify the influence of aromatic vs. non-aromatic side chains.
     - **Expected Outcome:** Improve predictions for molecules like **C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O**, which may have been misclassified due to oversimplifications in the rule.

   - **Electronegativity and Coordination Ability:**
     - **Problem:** The rule may not adequately consider the electron-donating or -withdrawing nature of side chains.
     - **Solution:** Adjust Rule 6 to account for the electronic properties of the side chains, specifying that side chains that enhance coordination with metal ions lead to high yield.

3. **Introduce New Rules or Modify Existing Ones:**

   - **Incorporate Rule for Polyhydroxy Acids:**
     - **Observation:** Molecules like **C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O** (gluconic acid) contain multiple hydroxyl groups, which may contribute to high yield.
     - **Solution:** Modify **Rule 7** or create a new rule emphasizing the role of polyhydroxy acids in achieving high yield.

   - **Address Exception Cases:**
     - **Observation:** Molecules predicted incorrectly may share features not adequately covered by current rules.
     - **Solution:** Analyze misclassified molecules to identify common features and adjust rules accordingly.

4. **Enhance Generalization:**

   - **Avoid Overly Broad or Narrow Rules:**
     - Ensure rules are neither too general (leading to overfitting) nor too specific (leading to underfitting).
     - Balance rule specificity with coverage to improve model generalization across the dataset.

   - **Incorporate Quantitative Descriptors:**
     - Use quantitative metrics (e.g., molecular weight, LogP, pKa) alongside categorical rules to capture subtler differences between modifiers.

5. **Iterative Testing and Validation:**

   - **Modify One Rule at a Time:**
     - To identify the impact of each change, adjust rules individually and observe the effect on validation accuracy and SHAP values.
     - **Example:** Adjust Rule 5 and re-run the model to see if underestimations decrease.
  
   - **Monitor SHAP Value Changes:**
     - Use SHAP analysis in each iteration to identify whether changes are reducing the negative impact of rules on misclassified molecules.

6. **Combine Rules for Synergistic Effects:**

   - **Rule Interactions:**
     - Explore whether combinations of features across rules lead to higher accuracy.
     - **Solution:** Create composite rules or interaction terms that capture synergistic effects between rules.

7. **Utilize External Validation Sets:**

   - **Assess Generalization:**
     - Test the refined model on an external dataset to evaluate whether improvements hold beyond the current data.
     - **Expected Outcome:** Confirm that adjustments lead to genuine enhancements in predictive performance.

8. **Consider Machine Learning Techniques:**

   - **Hybrid Approaches:**
     - Complement rule-based methods with machine learning algorithms that can capture complex patterns.
     - **Solution:** Use decision trees or random forests where rules serve as features, allowing the model to learn interactions.

**Conclusion**

By refining **Rule 5** and **Rule 6**, addressing underfitting issues, and leveraging insights from SHAP analysis, the model's accuracy can be improved. Adjustments should focus on enhancing rule specificity, accounting for additional chemical features, and ensuring that rules contribute positively to accurate predictions. Iterative testing and validation, combined with a careful examination of misclassified cases, will guide effective rule refinement.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization**

**Overview**

In analyzing the current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction, several key points have emerged:

1. **Incomplete Implementation of Rules**: Not all the defined chemical rules (15 in total) have been fully implemented in the code. This limits the model's ability to capture all relevant chemical features affecting the reaction yield.

2. **Variability in Rule Performance**: Some rules are performing well, with high confidence and lift (e.g., **Rule 6**, **Rule 8**, **Rule 4**, and **Rule 3**), indicating they are effective predictors of high yield. However, other rules (e.g., **Rule 5** and **Rule 9**) are underperforming, contributing to misclassifications and reducing overall model accuracy.

3. **Plateau in Model Performance**: The model's performance metrics, such as validation accuracy, confidence, lift, support, and leverage, suggest that improvements have plateaued. This indicates that the current rules may not sufficiently capture the complexities of the dataset.

4. **SHAP Analysis Insights**: The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis reveals that certain rules negatively impact the model's predictions, causing underestimations or overestimations of the reaction yield. Specifically, **Rule 5** is contributing significantly to misclassifications.

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

Based on the discussions and analyses, the following suggestions aim to improve the current rules:

1. **Implement All Defined Rules**

   - **Action**: Ensure that all 15 chemical rules are fully implemented in the code.
   - **Rationale**: Incorporating all rules allows the model to consider a comprehensive set of chemical features, potentially improving predictive accuracy.

2. **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Specificity**

   - **Rule 1**: **Refine Side-Chain Carboxyl Group Detection**
     - **Action**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to specifically identify α-amino acids with an additional carboxyl group at the β or γ position relative to the amino group.
     - **Rationale**: Enhances the accuracy of matching molecules that conform to Rule 1, ensuring that only relevant structures are captured.

   - **Rule 2**: **Specify Chain Length and Saturation**
     - **Action**: Refine the SMARTS patterns to detect unbranched, saturated aliphatic chains of specific lengths (e.g., C₈ for octanoic acid).

  **Rule 8** is clear in specifying **aromatic carboxylic acids with adjacent aldehyde groups** resulting in low yield. The physical-chemical insight about side reactions and catalyst deactivation is appropriate. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is adequately supported by data points: **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (both low yield).

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** clearly states that **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages** result in low yield. The physical-chemical explanation involves disruption of metal coordination due to ether-induced flexibility. While the rule meets clarity and complexity criteria, it lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one example—**2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** describes **polyhydroxy aliphatic acids (sugar acids)** yielding high results, with good physical-chemical insight about enhanced hydrogen bonding and additional coordination sites. The rule considers multiple functional groups, but coverage is limited to a single data point—**(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**—which may not be sufficient.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** focuses on **acylated amino acids (amide derivatives)** resulting in low yield. The rule is clear, and the physical-chemical reasoning about reduced metal coordination due to acylation is valid. Complexity is addressed by considering modifications to amino acids. However, the rule is only supported by one example—**(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**—limiting its coverage.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** specifies that **aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents or extended conjugation** result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight regarding steric hindrance and electron delocalization is appropriate. The rule meets the complexity criterion and is supported by at least two data points—**4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** and **(2S)-2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (tyrosine)—both yielding low, ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 13**:

  **Rule 13** highlights that modifiers with **adjacent keto and carboxyl groups on an aromatic system** yield high results. The physical-chemical explanation about forming stable chelate rings is sound. The rule is clear and considers combinations of functional groups. However, coverage is limited to a single example—**1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**—which may not adequately support the rule.

- **Comment 14**:

  **Rule 14** describes modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups and additional carbonyl groups** resulting in high yield. The physical-chemical insight is solid, but the rule is based on a single data point—**4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**—limiting its coverage despite meeting clarity and complexity criteria.

- **Comment 15**:

  **Rule 15** states that **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with keto groups** result in low yield, providing an acceptable physical-chemical rationale. The rule is clear and meets complexity requirements by combining multiple functional groups. However, it is only supported by one example—**4-oxoheptanedioic acid**—which may not offer sufficient coverage.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Rule 7 by incorporating additional examples**. Currently, Rule 7 regarding **perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids resulting in low yield** is supported by only one data point (**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**). **Strengthen this rule by identifying and including more perfluorinated compounds** that result in low yield to improve its coverage and validate the trend.

- **Advice 2**: **Expand Rule 9 with more supporting data**. Rule 9 addresses **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages resulting in low yield**, but it is backed by a single example (**2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**). **Include additional examples of such compounds** to solidify the rule and confirm that the presence of ether linkages consistently correlates with low yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Broaden Rule 10 by adding more polyhydroxy acids**. Rule 10 highlights **polyhydroxy aliphatic acids (sugar acids) resulting in high yield**, yet it lists only **gluconic acid** as an example. **Identify and incorporate other sugar acids** (e.g., **galactonic acid**, **mannonic acid**) that result in high yield to enhance the rule's robustness and applicability.

- **Advice 4**: **Augment Rule 13 with additional examples or generalize it**. Rule 13 focuses on modifiers containing **adjacent keto and carboxyl groups on an aromatic system** leading to high yield but is supported by only one compound (**1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**). **Seek out other compounds with similar functional group arrangements** or consider **generalizing the rule** to include a wider range of chelating groups that result in high yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Supplement Rule 14 with more data points**. Rule 14 pertains to **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups and additional carbonyl groups resulting in high yield** but includes only one example (**4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**). **Add more compounds fitting this description** to reinforce the rule, such as **vanillic acid derivatives** or other methoxy-substituted aromatic acids with carbonyl-containing side chains.

- **Advice 6**: **Re-evaluate Rule 15 and consider merging or expanding it**. Rule 15 deals with **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with keto groups resulting in low yield**, supported by a single example (**4-oxoheptanedioic acid**). **Investigate whether this trend holds true for similar compounds**, and if evidence is limited, **consider combining this rule with another** that addresses modifiers disrupting metal coordination due to internal functional groups.

- **Advice 7**: **Consolidate rules with overlapping concepts**. For instance, **merge Rule 7 and Rule 9** into a broader rule about **modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups or flexible linkages (like fluorination or ether groups) that hinder metal coordination**, leading to low yield. This would simplify the rule set and enhance its predictive power.

- **Advice 8**: **Identify and formulate new rules based on unaddressed patterns**. Review the dataset to detect any **recurring structural features among high or low yield modifiers** that are not captured by the current rules. For example, consider if aliphatic acids with **branched chains** or modifiers containing **specific heteroatoms** affect the yield and develop new rules accordingly.

- **Advice 9**: **Ensure each rule is supported by multiple examples of both high and low yield**. This strengthens the validity of the rules. For existing rules, **add counter-examples where appropriate** to clearly delineate the boundaries of each rule. This approach enhances the rules' reliability and applicability to a wider range of compounds.

- **Advice 10**: **Enhance clarity and consistency across all rules**. Review the wording to ensure that **each rule clearly specifies the chemical features and underlying physical-chemical properties**. Use consistent terminology and structure in presenting the rules. Additionally, for better user understanding, **include SMILES notations** of the examples where possible, as the rules are SMILES-based.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups (-COOH)**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules containing an **α-amino group (-NH₂)** attached to the central (alpha) carbon and at least one additional **carboxyl group (-COOH)** on the side chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The presence of multiple carboxyl groups allows for **chelation** with metal ions, forming stable complexes through **bidentate coordination**. This enhances the catalyst's stability and activity by creating strong metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic Acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic Acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**; those with additional polar groups along the chain result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Straight-chain aliphatic acids with a **terminal carboxyl group (-COOH)** and no other substituents.
    - **Low Yield**: Aliphatic acids with **hydroxyl (-OH)**, **amino (-NH₂)**, or other polar groups along the carbon chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Unsubstituted chains allow for **flexible coordination** with metal centers and minimize steric hindrance, facilitating effective binding.
    - **Low Yield**: Polar groups introduce **steric hindrance** or may **interfere with metal coordination**, disrupting optimal interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **Octanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups (EDGs) result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and a strong **EWG** (e.g., **nitro (-NO₂)**, **halogens**) at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic rings with a **carboxyl group** and an **EDG** (e.g., **methyl (-CH₃)**, **hydroxyl (-OH)**, **methoxy (-OCH₃)**) at the para position.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: EWGs increase the **acidity** of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge on the conjugate base, enhancing its ability to **coordinate** with metal ions.
    - **Low Yield**: EDGs decrease acidity by donating electron density, weakening metal-ligand coordination due to reduced ability to stabilize negative charges.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
      - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids without bulky substituents** result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules featuring a **nitrogenous heteroaromatic ring** (e.g., **pyridine**, **pyrazole**) with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and minimal additional substituents.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional **coordination sites**, enhancing metal-ligand binding through **donor-acceptor interactions**. This stabilizes the catalyst by forming strong complexes with metal ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic Acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains** result in **high yield**; those with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **nitrogenous heterocycles** (e.g., **indole ring** in tryptophan).
    - **Low Yield**: Amino acids with side chains containing **non-nitrogenous aromatics** (e.g., **phenyl ring** in phenylalanine).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: The nitrogen in the side chain provides additional **coordination sites**, enhancing metal binding and catalyst activity.
    - **Low Yield**: Lack of extra coordination sites leads to weaker metal-ligand interactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups (-SH) on the chain** result in **high yield**; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**:
    - **High Yield**: Aliphatic chains with **thiol groups** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.
    - **Low Yield**: Aromatic rings bearing **thiol groups** directly attached to the ring structure.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
    - **High Yield**: Thiol groups on aliphatic chains can form beneficial **soft-soft interactions** with metal ions without causing catalyst poisoning.
    - **Low Yield**: Thiol groups on aromatic rings may bind too strongly or irreversibly to metal centers, leading to **catalyst deactivation**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic acids where multiple hydrogens are replaced with **fluorine atoms**, significantly increasing the fluorine content.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: High fluorination increases **hydrophobicity** and exerts a strong **electron-withdrawing inductive effect**, reducing electron density on the carboxylate oxygen and hindering effective metal coordination.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups (-CHO) adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings bearing both a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and an **aldehyde group (-CHO)** in close proximity (ortho or para positions).

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Aldehyde groups can undergo **side reactions** or form undesired complexes with metal ions, leading to **catalyst deactivation** and reduced yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages (-O-) within the chain** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic acids featuring **ether linkages** in the carbon chain and a terminal **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Ether oxygens introduce **flexibility** and can disrupt effective **metal-ligand coordination**. They may also form unwanted interactions with metal ions, reducing catalyst activity.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy aliphatic acids (sugar acids)** result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Molecules with multiple **hydroxyl groups (-OH)** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**, such as **gluconic acid**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance **hydrogen bonding** and offer additional **coordination sites**, forming stable complexes with metal ions and improving catalyst performance.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic Acid)

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **acylated amino acids (amide derivatives)** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Amino acids where the **amino group (-NH₂)** is modified into an **amide group (-CONH-)**, such as through **acetylation** or peptide bond formation.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Acylation reduces the availability of the **amino group** for metal coordination, limiting binding interactions and decreasing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents** or **extended conjugation** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic acids with large substituents or additional aromatic rings that increase **steric bulk** or **conjugation**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: **Steric hindrance** from bulky groups impedes effective metal-ligand coordination. Extended conjugation can delocalize electron density, **weakening interactions** with metal centers.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Tyrosine)

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **adjacent keto (=O) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups** on an aromatic system result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic compounds with a **keto group** and a **carboxyl group** positioned to allow for **bidentate chelation**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The proximity of keto and carboxyl groups enables the formation of stable **five- or six-membered chelate rings** with metal ions, enhancing catalyst performance through strong coordination.

  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups (-OCH₃) and additional carbonyl groups within the side chain** result in **high yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aromatic rings with **methoxy substituents**, a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**, and additional **carbonyl groups** (e.g., ketones) in the side chain.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Methoxy groups can **activate** the aromatic ring toward coordination, while additional carbonyl groups provide extra **coordination sites**. This enhances metal-ligand interactions and stabilizes the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with keto groups** result in **low yield**.

  - **Chemical Features**: Aliphatic chains containing two **carboxyl groups (-COOH)** and an internal **keto group (-C=O)**.

  - **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The internal keto group can interfere with **metal coordination** by altering the geometry and electronic distribution, leading to less effective catalyst performance.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: For **Rule 3.1**, refine the SMARTS patterns to ensure that only **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position** are matched. The current patterns (`hydroxyl_group`, `[OX2][CX4]`, `amino_group`) are too general and may match non-aromatic compounds. Update the patterns to include aromatic context and specify the para position, for example:
  - Use `'[cH]-[c]([OX2H,OX1-,$(OC)]):[cH]:[c](C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])'` for hydroxyl groups at the para position.
  - Include positional constraints to ensure the EDG is at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 2**: For **Rule 13**, adjust the SMARTS patterns to specifically match **aromatic compounds with adjacent keto (=O) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups**. The current patterns may incorrectly match aliphatic compounds. Update the patterns to:
  - Include an aromatic ring in the pattern, such as `'[c][c](=O)[c](C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])'`.
  - Ensure that the keto and carboxyl groups are directly attached to the aromatic ring and adjacent to each other.

- **Suggestion 3**: For **Rule 3.1** and **Rule 3**, ensure that the molecule is **aromatic** before applying substituent patterns. Include the `aromatic_ring` pattern in the `patterns` list for these rules to confirm the presence of an aromatic ring:
  - Add `'[c]:[c]:[c]:[c]:[c]:[c]'` or similar patterns to detect aromatic rings.
  - This prevents non-aromatic molecules from being incorrectly matched based on general functional groups.

- **Suggestion 4**: For **Rule 2.1**, refine the patterns to correctly identify **aliphatic acids with additional polar groups along the chain** while excluding amino acids:
  - Modify the `aliphatic_chain` pattern to specify a minimum chain length, e.g., `'[C;X4H2][C;X4H2][C;X4H2][C;X4H2][C;X4H2]'` for a five-carbon chain.
  - Use `exclude_patterns` to omit molecules with alpha-amino groups, such as adding the `alpha_amino_acid` pattern to `exclude_patterns`.

- **Suggestion 5**: For **Rule 1**, ensure that the SMARTS patterns specifically match **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups (-COOH)**:
  - Update the `count_threshold` to check for at least two carboxyl groups, confirming one is in the side chain.
  - Use a pattern that connects the alpha carbon to another carbon bearing a carboxyl group, e.g., `'[NX3;H2,H1][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 6**: For **Rule 5.1**, adjust the patterns to differentiate between **α-amino acids with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains** and those with nitrogen-containing aromatics:
  - Use `exclude_patterns` to exclude molecules matching `aromatic_nitrogen`.
  - Ensure the side chain contains an aromatic ring without nitrogen, e.g., include `'[NX3;H2,H1][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX4][c]'` in `patterns`.

- **Suggestion 7**: For **Rule 10**, improve specificity by targeting **sugar acids** with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups:
  - Include patterns for multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups, such as `'[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.
  - This ensures that only polyhydroxy aliphatic acids are matched.

- **Suggestion 8**: For **Rule 2** and **Rule 2.1**, clarify the distinction between high and low yield modifiers based on the presence of **additional functional groups**:
  - For **Rule 2**, add `exclude_patterns` for any additional functional groups, not just polar ones.
  - For **Rule 2.1**, ensure `include_patterns` cover all polar functional groups, including ethers, alcohols, amines, and thiols, and confirm they are along the aliphatic chain.

- **Suggestion 9**: For **Rule 14**, refine the patterns to match **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups (-OCH₃) and additional carbonyl groups within the side chain**:
  - Use a pattern that specifies the methoxy group attached to the aromatic ring and a carbonyl in the side chain, e.g., `'[cH]-[c](OC)[cH]-[cH]-[CX3](=O)-[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.
  - Ensure positional relationships are correctly defined in the pattern.

- **Suggestion 10**: Review all SMARTS patterns and ensure they accurately reflect the **chemical features** described in the natural language rules:
  - Avoid overly broad patterns that may lead to false positives.
  - Include structural context, such as ring systems, chain lengths, and substituent positions.
  - Test patterns individually on known compounds to validate their accuracy.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

Upon reviewing the current rule metrics and comparing them to the previous metrics provided, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current rules.

---

**Comparison of Metrics:**

1. **Train Support:**
   - **Previous Metrics (Average):** Approximately **17.56%**.
     - Calculated as the average of 16.67% and 18.45%.
   - **Current Metric:** **10.38%**.

   *Observation:* The **train support** has **decreased** from the previous average. This means the current rules cover a **smaller proportion of the training data** compared to the previous rules.

2. **Train Confidence:**
   - **Previous Metrics (Average):** Approximately **58.74%**.
     - Calculated as the average of 63.52% and 53.96%.
   - **Current Metric:** **69.56%**.

   *Observation:* The **train confidence** has **increased** significantly. Higher confidence indicates that when the rule conditions are met, there is a higher likelihood that the predicted outcome will occur. This suggests an improvement in the **reliability** of the rules.

3. **Train Lift:**
   - **Previous Metrics (Average):** Approximately **1.13**.
     - Calculated as the average of 1.2048 and 1.0559.
   - **Current Metric:** **1.38**.

   *Observation:* The **train lift** has **increased** from the previous metrics. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. An increased lift suggests that the current rules have a **stronger association** with the predicted outcome.

4. **Train Leverage:**
   - **Previous Metrics (Average):** Approximately **0.01238**.
     - Calculated as the average of 0.02891 and -0.00415.
   - **Current Metric:** **0.01031**.

   *Observation:* The **train leverage** has **slightly decreased**. Leverage measures the difference between the observed support and the expected support if the rule's condition and prediction were independent. A positive leverage value indicates a stronger association than expected by chance, though the decrease suggests a **smaller difference from the expected value** compared to previous metrics.

---

**Interpretation:**

- **Increased Confidence and Lift:** The rise in both confidence and lift suggests that the current rules are **more effective** at predicting the desired outcome (high yield). This implies that the conditions defined by the rules are more **strongly correlated** with the outcome.

- **Decreased Support:** The reduction in support indicates that the rules apply to a **narrower subset** of the training data. While the rules are more accurate when they do apply, they are applicable less often.

- **Leverage Analysis:** Although leverage has decreased, it remains positive, indicating that the association captured by the rules is still **meaningful** and **not due to random chance**.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum Consideration:** The increasing trend in confidence and lift, coupled with a positive leverage, suggests that the algorithm is still making progress in improving the rules. Therefore, it is **unlikely** that a local minimum has been reached.

- **Iterations Sufficiency:** Given that the key metrics are still improving, especially the confidence and lift, it may be beneficial to continue with more iterations. However, caution should be exercised due to the decreasing support, which might signal overfitting to the training data.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Balance Specificity and Generality:**
   - **Issue:** The decrease in support indicates that rules are becoming too **specific**, covering fewer instances.
   - **Action:** Introduce some **generalizations** to the rules to increase their applicability without significantly sacrificing confidence and lift. This can be achieved by relaxing overly stringent conditions or combining similar rules.

2. **Re-evaluate Rule Conditions:**
   - **Issue:** Some rules may include conditions that, while increasing confidence, overly narrow the rule's applicability.
   - **Action:** Analyze each rule to identify and possibly remove conditions that contribute minimally to confidence but greatly reduce support.

3. **Enhance Data Diversity:**
   - **Issue:** Low support might be due to limited diversity in the dataset.
   - **Action:** Incorporate additional data or explore data augmentation techniques to **increase the representation** of different modifier types, which may help in refining rules that are both confident and widely applicable.

4. **Investigate Overfitting:**
   - **Issue:** High confidence and lift with low support could indicate **overfitting**.
   - **Action:** Validate the rules against a separate **test dataset** to ensure that the rules generalize well beyond the training data. Monitoring performance on unseen data can help detect overfitting early.

5. **Optimize Rule Pruning:**
   - **Issue:** Excessively complex rules might not contribute significantly to performance.
   - **Action:** Apply rule pruning techniques to eliminate redundant or low-impact rules. Focus on rules that offer the best trade-off between support, confidence, and lift.

6. **Leverage Domain Knowledge:**
   - **Issue:** Some rules may not align with established chemical knowledge.
   - **Action:** Collaborate with domain experts to **validate the chemical plausibility** of the rules. Incorporate insights to refine rules that make scientific sense and enhance predictive power.

7. **Monitor Leverage Values:**
   - **Issue:** Slightly decreased leverage indicates a potential reduction in unique associations.
   - **Action:** Aim to develop rules that not only have high confidence and lift but also **maximize leverage**, ensuring that they capture associations that are both strong and **unexpected**.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules exhibit **stronger predictive performance**, as evidenced by increased confidence and lift. However, the reduction in support raises concerns about the **generalizability** of the rules. To address this, efforts should focus on **broadening** the applicability of the rules while maintaining high confidence levels.

By carefully adjusting the specificity of the rules and validating them against additional data, it is possible to **enhance both the coverage and effectiveness** of the rules. Continuing with further iterations, guided by these recommendations, should help in achieving an optimal set of rules that are both accurate and broadly applicable, avoiding the pitfalls of overfitting and ensuring robust performance in practical applications.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

The current classification model achieved a validation accuracy of **68.57%**, which is a decrease from the previous validation accuracies of approximately **76%**. The prior test accuracies ranged from **62.5%** to **75%**, suggesting that earlier models performed better on unseen data.

This decrease in validation accuracy indicates that the current set of rules may not be as effective in capturing the underlying patterns associated with the modifier's loading on the catalyst. The reduced accuracy suggests potential issues with the model's ability to generalize, possibly pointing towards **underfitting**.

**Assessing Overfitting/Underfitting**

Given that both training and validation accuracies are lower than previous iterations, the model may be **underfitting** the data. This underfitting could result from the current rules being too general or missing critical features necessary for accurate prediction. It's essential to ensure that the rules are comprehensive enough to capture the complexity of the data without being overly simplistic.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values**

To identify specific rules contributing to prediction errors, we analyze the SHAP values for molecules where the model's predictions disagreed with the experimental values.

---

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

- The decrease in validation accuracy from **76%** to **68.57%** suggests that the current rules are less effective.
- The consistent mispredictions associated with **Rule6** and **Rule16** indicate potential issues with these rules.
- The model may benefit from refining these rules to improve overall accuracy.

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule6** often contributes large negative SHAP values in underestimations.
- **Rule16** contributes large positive SHAP values in overestimations.
- **Rule4** also negatively impacts predictions in some underestimation cases.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule6**

   - **Current Definition**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups (-SH) on the chain** result in **high yield**; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in **low yield**.
   - **Issue**: **Rule6** may be incorrectly penalizing molecules without thiol groups but with features similar to those specified in the rule, such as multiple hydroxyl groups.
   - **Action**:
     - **Clarify the Rule**: Ensure that **Rule6** only applies to aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups and does not negatively impact molecules without these groups.
     - **Revise Conditions**: Add conditions to prevent **Rule6** from applying to molecules like D-glucose and phthalic anhydride, which do not contain thiol groups but are affected by this rule.

2. **Refine Rule16**

   - **Current Definition**: *(Not provided)*
   - **Issue**: **Rule16** contributes to overestimations with high positive SHAP values in molecules where the experimental loading is low.
   - **Action**:
     - **Define Rule16**: Since **Rule16** is not specified, it needs to be clearly defined.
     - **Assess Impact**: Evaluate the chemical features that **Rule16** targets and determine if it's too general or misapplied.
     - **Modify Rule**: Adjust **Rule16** to reduce its positive impact on molecules incorrectly predicted to have high loading. Ensure it accurately captures the intended chemical features.

3. **Adjust Rule4**

   - **Current Definition**: Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids without bulky substituents** result in **high yield**.
   - **Issue**: **Rule4** has significant negative SHAP values in cases of underestimation.
   - **Action**:
     - **Review Applicability**: Check if **Rule4** is incorrectly penalizing molecules that should not be affected.
     - **Refine Criteria**: Narrow down the rule to prevent it from negatively impacting molecules like phthalic anhydride and 4-aminobenzoic acid.
     - **Exclude Certain Molecules**: Specify exceptions or additional conditions to improve the rule's accuracy.

4. **Review Rule1**

   - **Current Definition**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups (-COOH)** result in **high yield**.
   - **Issue**: **Rule1** contributes negative SHAP values in some underestimations.
   - **Action**:
     - **Verify Coverage**: Ensure **Rule1** correctly identifies molecules it should promote.
     - **Adjust Scope**: Broaden the rule if necessary to include molecules that are unfairly penalized.

5. **Improve Generalization**

   - **Address Underfitting**: The model's decreased accuracy suggests underfitting. Consider adding more nuanced rules or refining existing ones to better capture the data's complexity.
   - **Balanced Rules**: Ensure rules are neither too broad nor too narrow, avoiding overgeneralization or excessive specificity.

6. **Iterative Evaluation**

   - **Reassess After Changes**: After refining the rules, retrain the model and evaluate its performance.
   - **Monitor SHAP Values**: Use SHAP analysis in subsequent iterations to identify new issues or verify improvements.

7. **Incorporate Additional Data**

   - **Expand Dataset**: If possible, include more diverse molecules to enhance the model's learning and generalization capabilities.
   - **Consider Additional Features**: Introduce new descriptors or features that may capture relevant chemical properties not currently accounted for.

**Conclusion**

By analyzing the SHAP values and model performance, we've identified key rules contributing to prediction errors. Focusing on refining **Rule6**, **Rule16**, and **Rule4** is likely to improve model accuracy. Adjusting these rules based on the insights gained will help address underfitting and enhance the model's ability to predict modifier loadings accurately.

**Next Steps**

- **Refine the problematic rules as outlined.**
- **Retrain the model with the updated rules.**
- **Reevaluate model performance and SHAP analyses to confirm improvements.**
- **Iterate this process, continually refining the rules and model until satisfactory performance is achieved.**

**Summary and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

After analyzing the current set of rules and their performance metrics, several key observations and suggestions have been identified to improve the rules and enhance the predictive accuracy of the model.

**1. Performance Evaluation:**

- **Decreased Validation Accuracy:** The validation accuracy has decreased from approximately 76% in earlier iterations to 68.57% with the current rules. This suggests that the model's ability to generalize and correctly predict outcomes has diminished.
  
- **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
  - **Underestimation of High Loading:** Certain molecules with high experimental loading are being predicted as low loading due to specific rules (e.g., Rule 6, Rule 4, Rule 1) contributing significant negative SHAP values.
  - **Overestimation of Low Loading:** Some molecules with low experimental loading are predicted as high loading, with rules like Rule 16 contributing large positive SHAP values.

**2. Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

**Rule-Specific Recommendations:**

- **Rule 1 (α-Amino Acids with Side-Chain Carboxyl Groups):**
  - **Issue:** Negative SHAP values for molecules that should be positively influenced.
  - **Suggestion:** Refine the SMARTS patterns to specifically match α-amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups. Ensure that the pattern requires at least two carboxyl groups, confirming that one is on the side chain.

- **Rule 2 and Rule 2.1 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids):**
  - **Issue:** The distinction between high and low yield modifiers may be unclear.
  - **Suggestion:** Clarify and refine the patterns to accurately differentiate between aliphatic acids with and without additional functional groups. Use exclude patterns to omit molecules with polar groups along the chain for Rule 2, and include patterns for polar functional groups in Rule 2.1.

- **Rule 3 and Rule 3.1 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with EWGs or EDGs):**
  - **Issue:** Patterns may be too general and may not account for positional specificity.
  - **Suggestion:** Modify the SMARTS patterns to include aromatic context and specify the position of substituents. Ensure that the patterns accurately match molecules with the intended electronic characteristics at the correct positions.

- **Rule 4 (Nitrogen-Containing Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids):**
  - **Issue:** Negative SHAP values indicate possible misclassification.
  - **Suggestion:** Verify that the rule accurately targets molecules with nitrogenous heterocycles without bulky substituents. Refine the patterns to exclude molecules that do not fit these criteria.

- **Rule 5 and Rule 5.1 (α-Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains):**
  - **Issue:** Potential overlap or misclassification between nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains.
  - **Suggestion:** Adjust the patterns to differentiate clearly between the two types. Use exclude patterns to separate molecules with nitrogen-containing aromatics from those without.

- **Rule 6 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups):**
  - **Issue:** Significant negative impact on molecules without thiol groups but with similar features.
  - **Suggestion:** Ensure the rule specifically applies to aliphatic acids with thiol groups on the chain. Add conditions to prevent the rule from affecting molecules lacking thiol groups.

- **Rule 10 (Polyhydroxy Aliphatic Acids):**
  - **Issue:** The pattern may not be specific enough to target sugar acids.
  - **Suggestion:** Enhance the pattern to include multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups, ensuring that only polyhydroxy aliphatic acids are matched.

- **Rule 13 (Aromatic Compounds with Adjacent Keto and Carboxyl Groups):**
  - **Issue:** Current patterns may incorrectly match aliphatic compounds.
  - **Suggestion:** Update the patterns to specifically match aromatic systems with adjacent keto and carboxyl groups. Ensure the keto and carboxyl groups are directly attached to the aromatic ring and adjacent.

- **Rule 14 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Methoxy and Carbonyl Groups):**
  - **Issue:** Patterns may not accurately reflect the intended chemical features.
  - **Suggestion:** Refine the patterns to specify methoxy groups attached to the aromatic ring and additional carbonyl groups within the side chain, including positional relationships.

- **Rule 16:**
  - **Issue:** Contributes to overestimations but lacks clear definition.
  - **Suggestion:** Clearly define Rule 16, specifying the chemical features it targets. Evaluate its impact and adjust conditions to improve prediction accuracy.

**General Recommendations:**

- **Balance Specificity and Generality:**
  - Ensure that rules are neither too broad (leading to false positives) nor too narrow (resulting in low support). Aim for a balance that maintains high confidence without excessively restricting applicability.

- **Incorporate Structural Context:**
  - Include structural elements such as ring systems, chain lengths, and substituent positions in the SMARTS patterns to improve accuracy.

- **Enhance Data Diversity:**
  - If possible, expand the dataset to include more diverse molecules, enhancing the model's ability to generalize and reducing the risk of overfitting.

- **Iterative Refinement and Evaluation:**
  - Continuously refine the rules based on performance metrics and SHAP analysis, retraining the model after adjustments, and evaluating improvements.

**3. Potential for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

There is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current decrease in validation accuracy and observations from SHAP analysis indicate that the rules can be refined to enhance model performance. By carefully adjusting the rules based on the suggestions provided—ensuring that patterns accurately reflect the intended chemical features and improving the balance between specificity and generality—the model's predictive accuracy can be improved while maintaining generalizability.
