**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows us to determine whether a modifier leads to high yield based on the presence of an amino acid with an acidic side chain containing a carboxylic acid group. There is adequate property insight, as acidic side chains could influence the coordination environment of the catalyst. The rule combines sub-structures (amino acid and acidic side chain), meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two data points (L-glutamic acid, L-aspartic acid), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in identifying modifiers containing benzene rings with strong electron-withdrawing groups leading to high yield. The property insight is adequate, as electron-withdrawing groups can influence reactivity and stabilization of intermediates. The rule combines sub-structures (benzene ring and electron-withdrawing substituents), satisfying complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in stating that modifiers with benzene rings substituted with electron-donating groups lead to low yield. There is chemical reasoning behind it, as electron-donating groups may interfere with the catalyst's activity. It is sufficiently complex by considering the effect of substituents on aromatic rings. However, there is an exception with 4-aminobenzoic acid, which leads to high yield, not explained by this rule. The rule lacks consideration of exceptions, affecting its clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and specific, allowing for easy determination of whether a modifier falls under this category. The property insight is reasonable, given the coordination ability of pyridine rings, which may enhance catalyst performance. The rule considers specific structural features, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two data points (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and provides property insight regarding indole-containing modifiers possibly enhancing yield due to Ï€-interactions or coordination capabilities. However, it is only supported by a single data point (L-tryptophan), therefore it does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two supporting data points.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and provides good property insight into the effect of perfluoroalkyl and trifluoromethyl groups resulting in low yield, likely due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature affecting catalyst interaction. It is adequately complex, focusing on specific functional groups. It is supported by at least two data points (nonafluoropentanoic acid, trifluoroacetylaminobutanoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in differentiating between modifiers with thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) versus aromatic rings (low yield). The property insight is acceptable, as the position of the thiol group can affect coordination with the catalyst. The rule is appropriately complex, considering both the functional group and its placement. It is supported by two data points (3-mercaptopropionic acid, 4-mercaptobenzoic acid), fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and provides property insight into the effect of aldehyde groups leading to low yield, possibly due to their reactivity interfering with the catalyst. It meets the complexity criterion by focusing on a specific functional group. It is supported by at least two data points (5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear, and the property insight is acceptable, as acylation of amino groups may reduce the ability of modifiers to coordinate with the catalyst effectively. The complexity is sufficient, considering N-acyl derivatives of amino acids. It is supported by two data points (N-acetyl-L-lysine, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid), satisfying coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, and the property insight is reasonable, suggesting that long aliphatic chains without polar groups favor high yield, possibly due to hydrophobic interactions, while polar groups decrease yield. It is complex as it considers both chain length and the presence of polar substituents. With multiple supporting data points (octanoic acid for high yield; 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid for low yield), it satisfies the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear. The property insight is acceptable, as nitrogen heterocycles might enhance coordination with the catalyst. However, the rule is only supported by a single data point (1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), thus not meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear, and the property insight regarding amino groups on benzene rings enhancing yield is relevant, possibly due to increased coordination ability. However, the rule is only supported by one data point (4-aminobenzoic acid), so it does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two supporting data points.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides property insight, as polyether chains may interfere with catalyst activity due to their ability to chelate metals or alter solubility. The rule is appropriately complex, considering multiple ether linkages. It satisfies the coverage criterion with two data points (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid).

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is somewhat unclear due to exceptions not aligning with the data. For example, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid has an electron-withdrawing group but still results in low yield, contradicting the rule's exception clause. The property insight is reasonable, but the rule needs clarification to accurately reflect the observed results. It meets the complexity and coverage criteria but lacks clarity.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and provides property insight, as nitrogen heterocycles fused with aromatic systems might enhance catalyst interactions. However, it is only supported by one data point (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), failing to meet the coverage criterion of at least two supporting data points.

- **Comment 1**:
  - **Rule 1** is clear in specifying that amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups or indole rings result in high yield. The rule combines multiple sub-structures (amino group, carboxylic acid group, specific side chains), satisfying the complexity criterion. There are at least 4 data points supporting this rule ((2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, 5-aminopentanoic acid), fulfilling the coverage requirement. The rule provides good physical-chemical insight by linking the presence of additional carboxylic acids or indole rings to increased coordination or interaction with the catalyst, which could enhance the yield.

- **Comment 2**:
  - **Rule 2** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro, bromomethyl, or carbonyl groups lead to high yield. The rule is supported by at least 3 data points (4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid). It combines sub-structures of an aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, and specific electron-withdrawing substituents, meeting the complexity criterion. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, as electron-withdrawing groups could influence the electronic properties of the modifier, affecting coordination with the metal center and reaction pathways.

- **Comment 3**:
  - **Rule 3** asserts that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, lead to low yield. The rule is clear and supported by at least 4 data points (4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid). It combines an aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, and electron-donating substituents, satisfying the complexity and coverage criteria. The rule provides reasonable physical-chemical insight by correlating electron-donating groups with decreased ability to stabilize intermediates or interact effectively with the catalyst.

- **Comment 4**:
  - **Rule 4** states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched hydrocarbon chains and no additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; introducing polar functional groups lowers the yield. The rule is clear and considers combinations of sub-structures (aliphatic chain, carboxylic acid group, presence or absence of polar groups), meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points: high yield with octanoic acid and low yield with 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, suggesting that polar groups may interfere with the reaction or catalyst interaction.

- **Comment 5**:
  - **Rule 5** indicates that modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) functional groups result in low yield, even if they are aromatic carboxylic acids. The rule is clear and supported by at least 2 data points (4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid). It combines sub-structures of an aldehyde group with a carboxylic acid and aromatic ring, satisfying complexity and coverage criteria. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, as aldehyde groups may participate in unwanted side reactions or deactivate the catalyst.

- **Comment 6**:
  - **Rule 6** distinguishes between modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acid groups (high yield) and those attached via an aromatic ring (low yield). The rule is clear and considers structural connectivity, adding complexity. It is supported by high yield data points (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid) and a low yield example (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid). The physical-chemical insight is strong, as direct attachment might enhance coordination with the metal center, while linkage through an aromatic ring could hinder it.

- **Comment 7**:
  - **Rule 7** states that modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups result in low yield. The rule is clear and combines specific sub-structures (carboxylic acid group with perfluoroalkyl/trifluoromethyl groups), meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least 2 data points (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid). The physical-chemical insight is adequate, as fluorinated groups are highly electronegative and may affect the modifier's interaction with the catalyst or the reaction mechanism.

- **Comment 8**:
  - **Rule 8** explains that sulfur-containing functional groups yield varies based on location; thiol groups on aliphatic chains lead to high yield, while on aromatic rings lead to low yield. The rule is clear and considers the position of the functional group, adding complexity. It is supported by data points (high yield with 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, low yield with 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid). The physical-chemical insight is sound, as thiol groups on aliphatic chains may enhance coordination, while on aromatic rings may interfere due to steric or electronic factors.

- **Comment 9**:
  - **Rule 9** states that modifiers containing multiple ether linkages (polyether chains) result in low yield. The rule is clear and combines sub-structures (ether linkages, aliphatic chain, carboxylic acid group), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least 2 data points (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid). The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, as multiple ether linkages may increase flexibility and reduce effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Comment 10**:
  - **Rule 10** indicates that modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains lead to high yield due to increased coordination ability with metal centers. The rule is clear and combines sub-structures (multiple hydroxyl groups, aliphatic chain, carboxylic acid group), adding complexity. It is supported by at least 2 data points ((2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid, 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]amino]acetic acid). The physical-chemical insight is strong, as multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance binding to metal centers, promoting higher yield.

- **Comment 11**:
  - **Rule 11** states that modifiers that are N-acyl derivatives of amino acids result in low yield. The rule is clear and combines sub-structures (N-acyl group, amino acid backbone, carboxylic acid group), meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least one data point ((2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid). However, coverage is limited due to only one data point.

It is well-supported by multiple data points, with four high yield examples and three low yield examples, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** clearly differentiates modifiers based on the electronic nature of substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids. The physico-chemical insight is strong, as electron-withdrawing groups can influence reactivity by stabilizing negative charge or activating the carboxylic acid for interaction with the catalyst. The rule involves combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, and substituents), adding complexity. With four high yield examples and three low yield examples, the rule has good coverage.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear in its description that unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar groups lead to high yield, while polar groups diminish the yield. The rule provides physico-chemical insight into how polarity and chain structure affect the reaction, possibly through solvent interactions or catalyst binding. It combines sub-structures (chain length, branching, and functional groups), meeting the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by one high yield example and five low yield examples, offering adequate coverage.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** clearly states the effect of nitrogen heterocycles on yield based on their attachment to the carboxylic acid group. The physico-chemical insight is present, as nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers or participate in electron transfer processes. The rule considers the complexity of sub-structure combinations (heterocycle type and linkage), satisfying the complexity criterion. With four high yield examples and one low yield example, the rule has sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear in specifying that fluorinated alkyl chains lead to low yield. The physico-chemical insight is moderate, acknowledging that highly electronegative fluorine atoms can affect molecular properties like lipophilicity and electronic distribution. The rule focuses on a specific sub-structure, so complexity is moderate. Coverage is limited to two low yield examples, which is minimal but acceptable given the specificity of the rule.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** provides a clear distinction based on the location of thiol groups. The physico-chemical insight is sound, as aliphatic thiols may interact differently with the catalyst compared to aromatic thiols. The rule combines sub-structures (thiol location and carboxylic acid), meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage is minimal, with one high yield and one low yield example, suggesting that additional data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** clearly states that polyether chains or multiple ether linkages result in low yield. The physico-chemical insight is valid, considering that ether linkages increase polarity and may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (polyether chains and carboxylic acid groups), satisfying complexity. Coverage is limited to two low yield examples, indicating that more data would enhance the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is clear in associating polyhydroxylated aliphatic chains with high yield. The physico-chemical insight suggests that multiple hydroxyl groups may facilitate better solubility or interaction with the catalyst. The rule involves complex sub-structures (multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains), meeting the complexity criterion. With two high yield examples, coverage is sufficient but could be improved with more data points.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** clearly indicates that aromatic aldehyde groups lead to low yield. The physico-chemical insight is reasonable, as aldehyde groups may be reactive and interfere with catalyst function or be susceptible to side reactions. The rule focuses on a specific sub-structure, so complexity is lower. Coverage includes two low yield examples, which is acceptable for this specific structural feature.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** clearly identifies that aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with internal ketone groups lead to low yield. The physico-chemical insight is present, as ketone groups can affect the electron distribution and reactivity of the molecule. The rule considers complex sub-structures (dicarboxylic acids with ketones), satisfying the complexity criterion. However, coverage is minimal with only one low yield example, suggesting that more data is needed to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear and specifies that para-amino substitution on aromatic carboxylic acids leads to high yield. The physico-chemical insight is valid, as amino groups can donate electrons and activate the ring, possibly enhancing interaction with the catalyst. The rule involves specific sub-structure combinations, adding complexity. Coverage is minimal with one high yield example, indicating that additional data would improve the rule's reliability.

**Explanation and Considerations**:

- **Chemical Insights**: The rules are derived from analyzing the interplay between functional groups in the modifiers and their influence on the reaction yield. Functional groups that enhance coordination with the Fe ion or improve catalyst stability tend to increase yield. Conversely, groups that introduce steric hindrance, electron-donating effects, or competing coordination sites may decrease yield.

- **Combining Multiple Sub-structures**: Each rule combines various functional groups and structural features to capture the complexity of molecular interactions affecting the reaction outcome.

- **Physical-Chemical Properties**: Considerations include electron-withdrawing/donating effects, steric factors, coordination ability, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, and the presence of functional groups that may participate in side reactions.

- **Rule Coverage Balance**: The rules are designed to cover a broad range of the dataset while maintaining specificity where necessary. Simple rules with higher coverage are balanced with more complex rules that address specific cases.

- **Dataset Coverage**: The rules collectively account for the high or low yields observed in the dataset modifiers, providing predictive guidance for future modifier design.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows us to predict the yield based on the nature of amino acid side chains. It provides good chemical insight into how polar and hydrophilic groups enhance yield, likely due to better coordination with the metal center. The rule combines multiple sub-structures (amino acid backbone and side chains) and is supported by several high and low yield examples, showing good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly differentiates between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids and their impact on yield. It offers solid chemical insight into how these groups affect the electronic properties of the molecule. The rule combines sub-structures effectively and is well-supported by multiple examples for both high and low yields, demonstrating excellent coverage and balance.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly states the effects of polar functional groups on aliphatic carboxylic acids, with adequate chemical reasoning. While it combines sub-structures, the rule's coverage is somewhat limited, as it has only one high yield example (octanoic acid) and several low yield examples. Including more high yield data points would improve its robustness.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 provides clear guidelines on how the attachment of nitrogen heterocycles affects yield, offering good chemical insight into spatial and electronic factors influencing metal coordination. It combines multiple sub-structures but lacks sufficient low yield examples (only one provided), which slightly weakens its coverage. Additional low yield data would enhance the rule's validity.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 distinguishes between thiol group locations and their impact on yield, with acceptable chemical reasoning. However, the rule is supported by only one high yield and one low yield example, indicating limited coverage. More data points are necessary to strengthen the rule and ensure its reliability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that fluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield, providing chemical insight into the potential negative effects of fluorination on catalyst interaction. While the rule is clear, it only presents low yield examples. Including high yield counterexamples or demonstrating the absence thereof would improve the rule's coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 effectively relates multiple ether linkages to low yield, with appropriate chemical justification. It combines sub-structures and is supported by two low yield examples. While acceptable, the rule would benefit from additional examples to enhance coverage and confirm its general applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly connects multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains to high yield. The chemical insight is sound, suggesting enhanced coordination with the metal center. The rule combines relevant sub-structures and has adequate coverage with two high yield examples, demonstrating a good balance.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 indicates that aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a ketone group result in low yield. While the rule is clear and provides chemical reasoning, it is based on a single example, limiting its coverage. Additional supporting data are needed to confirm the rule's validity and improve its robustness.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 concisely states that N-acetylated amino acids or peptides lead to low yield, offering chemical insight into how N-acetylation might hinder metal coordination. The rule effectively combines sub-structures and is supported by two low yield examples, providing acceptable coverage and balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 suggests that aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl or methoxy groups lead to low yield. However, this is contradicted by the dataset where **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** exhibits high yield. This inconsistency indicates that the rule may not fully capture the influence of such substituents on yield. The rule lacks clarity and sufficient coverage, and may require revision to accurately reflect the data.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 effectively correlates multiple carboxyl groups with high yield due to enhanced metal-chelating ability. It provides solid chemical insight and combines multiple sub-structures. The rule has good coverage with several high yield examples, indicating robustness and a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly associates electron-deficient heterocycles with high yield, offering chemical rationale related to improved metal coordination. The rule combines relevant sub-structures and is well-supported by multiple high yield examples, demonstrating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 effectively states that bulky hydrophobic groups lead to low yield due to steric hindrance, with sound chemical reasoning. It combines sub-structures and is supported by examples of low yield modifiers, indicating acceptable coverage and balance.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 indicates that modifiers with aldehyde groups on aromatic rings result in low yield, possibly due to competing reactions or coordination issues. The rule is clear, combines pertinent sub-structures, and is supported by two low yield examples, providing adequate coverage and chemical insight.

**Explanation and Considerations**:

- **Chemical Insights**: The rules are formulated based on how different functional groups and structural motifs in the modifiers influence the reaction yield. Functional groups that enhance coordination with the iron catalyst or improve catalyst stability tend to increase the yield. Groups introducing steric hindrance, electron-donating effects, or potential competing interactions with the metal center may decrease the yield.

- **Combining Multiple Sub-structures**: Each rule integrates multiple functional groups and structural features to capture the complex interplay affecting the reaction outcome. For example, Rule 3 considers both the position and electronic nature of substituents on an aromatic ring.

- **Physical-Chemical Properties**: The rules take into account electron-withdrawing/donating effects, steric factors, metal coordination ability, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, and the propensity for side reactions or competing interactions.

- **Rule Coverage Balance**: The set of rules strikes a balance between broad applicability and specificity. Simpler rules cover general trends in the dataset, while more complex rules address specific exceptions and nuances.

- **Dataset Coverage**: Collectively, these rules explain the high or low yields observed across the dataset and provide predictive guidance for designing new modifiers.

- **Exceptions and Nuances**: Where exceptions occur (e.g., Rule 13's exception for a high-yield modifier with methoxy groups), they are noted to refine the predictive power of the rules and account for additional factors like the presence of coordinating groups.

---

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote Î´-C(spÂ³)â€“H bond functionalization reaction. These predictions can guide the selection or design of modifiers to optimize the reaction outcome.

**Explanation and Considerations**:

- **Chemical Insights**: The rules are formulated based on the influence of functional groups on the coordination chemistry with the iron catalyst and the reaction mechanism. Functional groups that enhance coordination with the iron center or stabilize the catalyst intermediate tend to increase the reaction yield.

- **Combining Multiple Sub-structures**: Each rule integrates multiple functional groups and structural motifs to reflect the complex interactions affecting the reaction outcome. For example, Rule 2 considers both the electronic nature of substituents and their position on the aromatic ring.

- **Physical-Chemical Properties**: The rules account for electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects, steric hindrance, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, and the ability of functional groups to act as ligands coordinating to the metal center.

- **Dataset Coverage**: The rules collectively cover the majority of the dataset, explaining both high and low yields observed. Emphasis is placed on rules that apply to multiple modifiers to ensure broader applicability.

- **Balance of Rules**: There is a balance between simple rules with high coverage (e.g., Rule 2) and more complex rules that address specific cases (e.g., Rule 11). This balance ensures both general trends and nuanced exceptions are captured.

- **Predictive Utility**: These rules can predict the likely yield outcome for new modifiers based on their structural features, aiding in the rational design of modifiers to optimize the reaction.

- **Exceptions and Nuances**: Notable exceptions are highlighted within the rules to refine their predictive power. For instance, Rule 11 acknowledges that additional coordinating groups can offset the negative impact of certain functional groups.

**Explanation and Considerations**:

- **Chemical Insights**: The rules are based on the functional groups and structural motifs of the modifiers that affect their ability to coordinate with the iron ion in the catalyst. Effective metal coordination is key to enhancing catalytic activity and increasing yield.

- **Combining Sub-structures**: Each rule combines multiple sub-structures or functional groups, such as the presence of amino acids with specific side chains, aromatic rings with substituents, and functional group proximity, to assess their combined effect on the yield.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**:
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and enhance metal coordination, while electron-donating groups decrease acidity.
  - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky side chains or distal functional groups may hinder effective coordination due to spatial constraints.
  - **Chelation Ability**: Multiple adjacent coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxyls, heteroatoms) enhance chelation and stabilize the metal center.
  - **Functional Group Interactions**: Specific functional groups (thiols vs. thioethers, amines vs. amides) have different coordination strengths.

- **Dataset Coverage**: The rules aim to cover a broad range of the provided dataset, explaining the high or low yield outcomes for the modifiers listed. By prioritizing rules that address common structural features, the rules offer predictive value for new modifiers with similar characteristics.

- **Balance of Rules**: The set includes both general rules with wide applicability (e.g., effects of substituents on aromatic rings) and more specific rules that address particular structural motifs (e.g., fluorinated chains, thioethers), maintaining a balance between coverage and specificity.

- **Predictive Utility**: These rules can be used to predict the yield outcome of other modifiers by analyzing their structural features, aiding in the rational design of modifiers that will enhance the catalytic performance.

- **Improvements over Previous Rules**:
  - **Consolidation**: Similar or overlapping rules have been combined to reduce redundancy and improve clarity.
  - **Clarity**: Rules have been rephrased for better understanding, with clear distinctions between high and low yield predictors.
  - **Exceptions Noted**: Where exceptions occur, they are acknowledged, providing a more nuanced understanding.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:
  
  **Rule 1** is clear and allows for a straightforward determination of yield based on the presence of EWGs or EDGs on aromatic carboxylic acids. It provides solid physical-chemical insight into how electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination with the metal catalyst, leading to high yield, while electron-donating groups have the opposite effect. The rule effectively combines sub-structures by considering both the aromatic ring and the nature of the substituents. It is well-supported by multiple data points in the dataset, with high yield examples like **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and low yield examples like **4-methylbenzoic acid**, satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**:
  
  **Rule 2** is generally clear, specifying that amino acids with simple aliphatic or acidic side chains lead to high yield, while those with bulky or aromatic side chains result in low yield. It offers good physical-chemical insight into how steric hindrance from bulky side chains can impede coordination with the catalyst. The rule combines sub-structures by considering both the amino acid backbone and the nature of the side chain. However, there is an inconsistency in the dataset: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), which has a bulky aromatic side chain, actually results in **high yield** (True). This exception suggests that the rule may need refinement to account for specific cases where aromatic side chains do not hinder the reaction, potentially due to additional interactions or the electronic nature of the indole group.

- **Comment 3**:
  
  **Rule 3** is clear in distinguishing between modifiers with heterocyclic nitrogen rings directly attached to carboxylic acid groups (high yield) and those with separated rings (low yield). It provides good property insight, highlighting the importance of direct coordination through heteroatoms. The rule combines sub-structures effectively. However, there is a discrepancy in the dataset: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** has a separated ring but results in **high yield** (True), contrary to the rule's prediction. This suggests that the spatial relationship and flexibility of certain linkers may still permit effective coordination, indicating a need to refine the rule to account for linker length and flexibility.

- **Comment 4**:
  
  **Rule 4** is clear and provides valuable insight into how multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group enhance coordination with the catalyst, leading to high yield. It combines sub-structures by considering both the aliphatic chain and the positioning of hydroxyl groups. The rule is well-supported by data, with **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid) yielding high and **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** yielding low. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 5**:
  
  **Rule 5** is clear and distinguishes between aliphatic thiols adjacent to the carboxylic acid (high yield) and aromatic thiols (low yield). It offers good property insight into how the nature and position of the thiol group affect coordination efficiency. The rule effectively combines sub-structures and is supported by data points like **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** yielding high and **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** yielding low. The balance between complexity and coverage is satisfactory.

- **Comment 6**:
  
  **Rule 6** is clear, stating that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield, while those with extra groups reduce yield. It provides property insight into how unfunctionalized chains may favor better packing or interaction with the catalyst. The rule combines sub-structures and is supported by data such as **octanoic acid** yielding high and **7-aminoheptanoic acid** yielding low. The rule achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**:
  
  **Rule 7** is somewhat less clear due to the exception clause "unless other strong coordinating groups are present," which could be subjective. However, it does offer property insight into how electron-donating groups on aromatic rings typically lead to low yield by decreasing coordination efficiency, unless compensated by other groups. The rule combines sub-structures but may benefit from clearer definitions. It is supported by data like **4-methylbenzoic acid** yielding low, with **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** as a high-yield exception, suggesting a need to specify which coordinating groups can override the EDG effect.

- **Comment 8**:
  
  **Rule 8** is clear and provides sound property insight into how conjugated aldehyde or ketone groups can lead to side reactions, reducing yield. It focuses on specific sub-structures and is supported by data points like **4-formylbenzoic acid** yielding low. The rule is appropriate in complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**:
  
  **Rule 9** is clear, stating that ether linkages in aliphatic chains lead to low yield due to increased flexibility and reduced coordination efficiency. It gives a plausible property insight and combines sub-structures effectively. The rule is supported by data such as **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** yielding low. The balance between complexity and coverage is suitable.

- **Comment 10**:
  
  **Rule 10** is clear in indicating that N-acetylated amino acids or those with internal amide bonds result in low yield due to blocked coordination sites. It offers good property insight and combines sub-structures. The rule is supported by data points like **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** yielding low. While coverage is acceptable, it may be strengthened by additional supporting data.

- **Comment 11**:
  
  **Rule 11** is clear and provides property insight into how fluorinated alkyl chains reduce electron density and increase hydrophobicity, leading to low yield. It focuses on specific sub-structures and is supported by data such as **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** yielding low. The rule's complexity and coverage are appropriate.

- **Comment 12**:
  
  **Rule 12** is reasonably clear, highlighting that condensed heterocyclic rings with heteroatoms directly attached to carboxylic acid groups result in high yield. It offers property insight and combines sub-structures. The rule is supported by data like **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** yielding high. The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 13**:
  
  **Rule 13** is clear in stating that modifiers with long aliphatic chains bearing distal amino or hydroxyl groups (beyond three carbons from the carboxylic acid) result in low yield. It provides insightful reasoning regarding the reduced influence of distant functional groups on coordination. The rule combines sub-structures and is supported by data such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** yielding low. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 14**:
  
  **Rule 14** is clear, indicating that aromatic amines directly attached to carboxylic acid groups result in high yield due to enhanced coordination. It provides good property insight and combines sub-structures. However, the rule is supported by a single data point (**4-aminobenzoic acid** yielding high), which limits its coverage. Additional supporting data would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 15**:
  
  **Rule 15** is clear and offers property insight into how thioether groups in side chains result in low yield due to weaker coordination compared to thiols. It focuses on specific sub-structures but is only supported by one data point (**2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** yielding low). The limited coverage suggests that more data is needed to fully validate this rule.
