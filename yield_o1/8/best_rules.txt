**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with polar or acidic side chains**, such as additional **carboxyl**, **amino**, or **indole** groups, result in **high yield**.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Amino acid backbone, side chains with polar functional groups (carboxyl, amino, indole).
  - *High Yield Examples*:  
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-tryptophan)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with hydrophobic side chains** (e.g., **phenyl group**) result in **low yield**.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Amino acid backbone, hydrophobic side chain lacking additional polar functional groups.
  - *Low Yield Example*:  
    - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (L-phenylalanine)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-withdrawing groups** such as **nitro**, **bromomethyl**, or **carbonyl** groups lead to **high yield**; those substituted with electron-donating groups like **hydroxyl** or **methoxy** result in **low yield**.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, substituents that are electron-withdrawing or electron-donating.
  - *High Yield Examples*:  
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:  
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched hydrocarbon chains** and **no additional polar functional groups** lead to **high yield**; introducing **polar groups** such as **hydroxyl**, **amino**, or **ether linkages** lowers the yield.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Linear aliphatic chain, carboxylic acid group, absence or presence of polar functional groups.
  - *High Yield Example*:  
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:  
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde (formyl)** functional groups on an aromatic ring lead to **low yield**.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Aromatic ring, aldehyde group, carboxylic acid group.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:  
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group** result in **high yield**; if the **nitrogen heterocycle is attached via another aromatic ring**, the yield is **low**.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Nitrogen-containing heterocycle, direct attachment to carboxylic acid group.
  - *High Yield Examples*:  
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*:  
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **fluorinated alkyl chains**, such as **perfluoroalkyl** or **trifluoromethyl groups**, result in **low yield**.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Fluorinated alkyl chain, carboxylic acid group.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:  
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups** lead to varying yields depending on their position: **thiol groups on aliphatic chains** result in **high yield**, while **thiol groups on aromatic rings** result in **low yield**.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Thiol group location (aliphatic vs. aromatic), carboxylic acid group.
  - *High Yield Example*:  
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*:  
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains** or multiple **ether linkages in aliphatic chains** result in **low yield**.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Aliphatic chains with multiple ether linkages, carboxylic acid group.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:  
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **polyhydroxylated aliphatic chains** or multiple **hydroxyl groups** result in **high yield**.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Aliphatic chain with multiple hydroxyl groups, carboxylic acid group.
  - *High Yield Examples*:  
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **N-acyl derivatives of amino acids**, such as **N-acetylated** amino acids, result in **low yield**.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Amino acid backbone, N-acyl group (e.g., acetyl), carboxylic acid group.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:  
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (N-acetyl-L-lysine)
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with amino groups at the para position** lead to **high yield**.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, amino group at the para position.
  - *High Yield Example*:  
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-donating groups** like **hydroxyl** or **alkyl** groups at the para position result in **low yield**.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, electron-donating substituents at para position.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:  
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with keto groups** in the chain lead to **low yield**.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Linear aliphatic chain, two carboxylic acid groups, ketone group within the chain.
  - *Low Yield Example*:  
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **methoxy groups on aromatic rings** without additional electron-withdrawing groups result in **low yield**.
  - *Sub-structures Combined*: Aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, methoxy substituents.
  - *Low Yield Example*:  
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Note*: An exception is observed with **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**, which results in **high yield**, possibly due to the presence of a ketone group conjugated with the aromatic ring enhancing electron withdrawal.
