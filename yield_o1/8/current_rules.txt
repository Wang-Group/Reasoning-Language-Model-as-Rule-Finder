**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with additional carboxylic acid groups (acidic side chains) result in a **high yield**; α-amino acids with neutral or basic side chains result in a **low yield**.**

- **Substructures Combined**: α-Amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups.

- **High Yield Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*

- **Low Yield Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Acetylated lysine)*

- **Note**: The extra carboxylic acid group enhances metal coordination through chelation, improving the yield. Neutral or basic side chains lack this feature, resulting in a lower yield.

---

**Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (EWGs) on the ring result in a **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents (EDGs) result in a **low yield**.**

- **Substructures Combined**: Aromatic rings with carboxylic acid groups and substituents that are EWGs (e.g., nitro, halogens) vs. EDGs (e.g., methyl, methoxy).

- **High Yield Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(Nitro group as a strong EWG)*
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(Bromomethyl group as an EWG)*

- **Low Yield Examples**:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Methyl group as an EDG)*
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Hydroxy group as an EDG)*

- **Exceptions**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(Amino group as an EDG but forms additional coordination bond)*

- **Note**: EWGs increase acidity and enhance metal coordination. EDGs decrease acidity, reducing coordination ability. Amino groups, while EDGs, can coordinate via the lone pair on nitrogen.

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles result in a **high yield** due to additional coordination via the nitrogen atom.**

- **Substructures Combined**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings).

- **High Yield Examples**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Nicotinic acid)*
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Low Yield Example**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Steric hindrance from biaryl structure)*

- **Note**: Nitrogen heterocycles provide additional coordination sites. However, steric hindrance from bulky structures can impede coordination.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups (–SH) adjacent to the carboxylic acid result in a **high yield**; those with thiol groups on aromatic rings result in a **low yield**.**

- **Substructures Combined**: Thiol groups adjacent to carboxylic acids in aliphatic vs. aromatic settings.

- **High Yield Example**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

- **Low Yield Example**:
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Note**: Aliphatic thiols are more reactive and accessible for metal coordination. Aromatic thiols are less effective due to resonance stabilization and steric factors.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with aliphatic carboxylic acids having adjacent hydroxyl groups result in a **high yield**; those with hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxylic acid result in a **low yield**.**

- **Substructures Combined**: Carboxylic acids with neighboring hydroxyl groups.

- **High Yield Examples**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

- **Low Yield Example**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Note**: Adjacent hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with metal centers. Distant hydroxyls are less effective due to decreased chelation ability.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic carboxylic acids having amino groups within three carbons of the carboxylic acid result in a **high yield**; those with amino groups more distant result in a **low yield**.**

- **Substructures Combined**: Proximity of amino groups to the carboxylic acid.

- **High Yield Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(Amino group close to the carboxyl)*
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*

- **Low Yield Examples**:
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Note**: Closer amino groups enhance chelation. Distant amino groups have reduced coordinating ability.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in a **high yield** due to minimal steric hindrance and effective coordination.**

- **Substructures Combined**: Straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids.

- **High Yield Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Note**: Simplicity allows unobstructed interaction with the catalyst's metal centers.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages within their backbone result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination efficiency from increased conformational freedom.**

- **Substructures Combined**: Presence of ether linkages (–O–) in the molecular backbone.

- **Low Yield Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Note**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility, hindering optimal alignment for effective metal coordination.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with highly fluorinated aliphatic chains result in a **low yield** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms and increased hydrophobicity.**

- **Substructures Combined**: Aliphatic chains extensively substituted with fluorine atoms.

- **Low Yield Examples**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Note**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density, weakening coordination bonds. Increased hydrophobicity can also impede interaction with the catalyst.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing reactive carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones) adjacent to the carboxylic acid result in a **low yield** due to potential side reactions and reduced coordination ability.**

- **Substructures Combined**: Presence of aldehyde or ketone groups near the carboxylic acid.

- **Low Yield Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Note**: Reactive carbonyl groups can participate in undesired side reactions or interfere with metal coordination.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups result in a **low yield** due to blocking of potential coordination sites necessary for effective metal binding.**

- **Substructures Combined**: Amino groups modified by acylation (e.g., acetylation).

- **Low Yield Example**:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Note**: Acylation reduces the availability of lone pair electrons on nitrogen for coordination with metal centers.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids possessing amino groups result in a **high yield** due to additional coordination via the amino group.**

- **Substructures Combined**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with amino substituents.

- **High Yield Example**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

- **Low Yield Example**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*

- **Note**: The amino group enhances metal coordination. However, if the amino group is part of a bulky side chain or sterically hindered, the yield may be reduced.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings directly attached to additional aromatic rings (biaryl structures) result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and decreased coordination efficiency.**

- **Substructures Combined**: Biaryl compounds with carboxylic acid groups.

- **Low Yield Example**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **High Yield Exception**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(Spacer reduces steric hindrance)*

- **Note**: Directly linked aromatic rings increase steric bulk, which can impede effective interaction with the catalyst.

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with fused aromatic rings containing additional oxygen functionalities adjacent to carboxylic acids result in a **high yield** due to enhanced coordination through multiple oxygen atoms.**

- **Substructures Combined**: Fused aromatic rings with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid.

- **High Yield Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

- **Note**: The rigid and planar structure with multiple oxygen donors facilitates effective chelation with metal centers.

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with β-phenylpropanoic acid structures result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance affecting coordination with the catalyst.**

- **Substructures Combined**: Aromatic ring attached to a propanoic acid side chain.

- **Low Yield Example**:
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Note**: The extra methylene group between the aromatic ring and carboxylic acid increases steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering electronic effects (such as electron-withdrawing or donating substituents), steric factors (such as steric hindrance from bulky groups), and the ability of functional groups to coordinate with metal centers (through chelation or additional coordination sites), the rules provide insights into designing modifiers that optimize the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------
