**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows us to easily determine whether a modifier matches the description of amino acids with acidic side chains (containing both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups). The property insight is strong, as the additional carboxylic acid groups may enhance metal coordination and catalyst stability, improving yield. The rule considers a combination of functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two data points—(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid—meeting the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 lacks clarity due to inconsistencies between the description and examples. While it mentions modifiers with an amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring, one of the examples provided, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, does not have an amino group but a nitrogen atom in the ring. This mismatch reduces clarity. The property insight is weakened by this inconsistency. Coverage is limited, and the rule may not reliably predict outcomes, suggesting a need for refinement.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in specifying modifiers containing a pyridine ring directly attached to the carboxyl group, yielding high value. The property insight is solid, as the nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers. It considers specific structural features, adding complexity. Supported by data points like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (high yield), it meets the coverage criterion. However, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yields low value, indicating that additional structural factors may influence the outcome, suggesting the rule might need adjustments for broader applicability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and straightforward, focusing on long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (carbon chain lengths of six or more) yielding high value. The property insight is reasonable, relating to hydrophobic interactions enhancing catalyst microenvironment. While octanoic acid supports the rule (high yield), 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid yields low value, implying that additional functional groups (like hydroxyl groups) can influence results. The rule's simplicity limits complexity, and coverage is moderate. Overall, it balances simplicity and applicability effectively.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is moderately clear but could benefit from more specificity regarding the positions of electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring. The property insight is valid, as electron-donating groups can enhance catalyst interaction. Supported by 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (high yield), it shows that placement matters. However, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yields low value, suggesting that chain length or additional structural elements affect the outcome. The rule captures complexity by considering group positions but has limited coverage due to conflicting data.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, stating that modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups on an aromatic ring yield high value. The property insight is somewhat counterintuitive but plausible if such groups stabilize intermediates. Supported by 4-nitrobenzoic acid (high yield), the rule has limited coverage with few data points. It focuses on a single functional group, keeping complexity low. Additional data would strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and well-supported, stating that modifiers containing aldehyde groups yield low value. The property insight is strong, as aldehyde groups may deactivate the catalyst. Supported by 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (both low yield), it meets the coverage criterion. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, with the property insight that fluorinated groups may disrupt catalyst interactions. Supported by 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid (low yield), the rule has limited coverage due to a single data point. Complexity is low, focusing on specific functional groups. More data would enhance its reliability.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear, indicating that amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains yield low value. The property insight is sound, as such side chains may not interact favorably with the catalyst. Supported by (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (low yield), it meets the coverage criterion. The rule balances complexity by considering both amino acid nature and side-chain properties.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, with the property insight that distant amino groups may not coordinate effectively with active sites. Supported by 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid (both low yield), it satisfies coverage requirements. The rule addresses complexity by considering the spatial arrangement of functional groups.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and detailed, distinguishing between thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) and those directly attached to aromatic rings (low yield). The property insight is strong, and the rule is supported by 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield). It effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear, stating that modifiers with ketone groups on aliphatic chains yield low value. The property insight is acceptable, as ketone groups may interfere with catalyst activity. Supported by 4-oxoheptanedioic acid (low yield), coverage is limited but adequate. The rule is specific, maintaining appropriate complexity.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear, indicating that modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles attached to carboxyl groups yield high value. The property insight is solid, with nitrogen heterocycles enhancing coordination. Supported by 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (both high yield), it meets coverage criteria. The rule effectively incorporates complexity.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 acknowledges variability with modifiers containing ether linkages, which is clear and honest about prediction limitations. The property insight recognizes that other structural factors influence outcomes. Supported by examples yielding both high and low values, the rule accepts complexity and coverage issues.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 lacks clarity due to vague references to "additional functional groups." The property insight is incomplete without specifying which groups enhance yield. Supported only by 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (high yield), coverage is limited. Complexity is high but not balanced by sufficient data. The rule requires refinement for better applicability.

  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both amino and two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize the metal complex by delocalizing electron density, which improves catalytic activity.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids yield low value.**
  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduce the ability of the carboxylate oxygen to coordinate with the metal center, diminishing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains yield high value when multiple hydroxyl groups are also present; otherwise, they yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance metal coordination despite the presence of ether linkages, whereas ethers alone may not provide sufficient interaction.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings attached via short aliphatic chains yield high value; those with shorter chains or directly attached yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers improve flexibility and positioning of hydroxyl groups for effective metal coordination.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with amino groups located within five carbons of the carboxyl group yield high value; those with amino groups farther away or acylated yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl enhances chelation with metal centers. Distant or acylated amino groups are less effective in metal coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or form inactive complexes with metal ions, deactivating the catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low value unless additional strong coordinating groups are present.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weak donors for metal coordination. Without additional coordinating groups, the overall metal-binding ability is insufficient to enhance catalytic performance.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (with eight or more carbons) yield high value unless they contain interfering functional groups.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may improve substrate accessibility and stabilize the catalyst. Interfering groups (like distant amino groups) can disrupt metal coordination, reducing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups near the carboxyl group yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can chelate with metal centers in a way that competes with the active site or alters the catalyst structure, leading to decreased catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value only when additional coordinating groups are present.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density and can enhance metal interactions when coupled with other coordinating groups. Without them, the coordination is insufficient to impact the yield positively.

  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of the amino group reduces its availability for metal coordination, diminishing its ability to enhance catalyst activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing amino groups directly attached to aromatic rings yield high value; those with amino groups on aliphatic chains yield high value only when the chain is short.**
  - *High Yield Example (Aromatic Amino Group)*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**.
  - *High Yield Example (Short Aliphatic Chain)**: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example**: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale**: Aromatic amino groups enhance metal coordination due to conjugation with the ring. Aliphatic amino groups are effective when close to the carboxyl group, enabling strong chelation; distant amino groups are less effective.

  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. Shorter chains limit this interaction due to steric constraints.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing acylated amino groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of the amino group reduces its nucleophilicity and availability for metal coordination, diminishing its ability to enhance catalyst activity.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings fused to nitrogen-containing heterocycles yield high value.**
  - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).

  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains without effective coordinating groups are less efficient in metal coordination due to steric hindrance and decreased solubility, leading to lower catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing keto (carbonyl) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group yield low yield.**
  - *Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups near the carboxyl group can chelate with metal centers in a way that competes with the active site or alters the catalyst structure, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing acylated amino groups yield low yield.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of the amino group reduces its nucleophilicity and availability for metal coordination, diminishing its ability to enhance catalyst activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains of five carbons yield high yield; shorter chains yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. Shorter chains limit this interaction due to steric constraints, leading to lower yields.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been carefully formulated to illustrate direct combinations of substructures (functional groups) in the modifiers and their impact on the reaction yield. They consider underlying physicochemical properties such as metal coordination ability, chain length, and electronic effects. Each rule clearly predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad range of the dataset, balancing simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., Rules 1 and 2) and more complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., Rules 11 and 15). This ensures that the majority of the modifiers in the dataset are accounted for.

- **Abandoned and Revised Rules**: Some of the original rules were revised or replaced to better fit the data and underlying chemistry. For example, Rule 2 was adjusted to focus on the coordination ability of substituents rather than their electron-withdrawing or donating nature, which better explains the observed yields.

- **Combination of Functional Groups**: Several rules combine multiple substructures to predict the yield effectively. For instance, Rule 7 considers both ether linkages and the presence of additional coordinating groups like hydroxyls.

By following these rules, predictions can be made about the expected yield of the reaction for any given modifier based on its structural features.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** clearly states that keto groups adjacent to the carboxyl group yield low yield. The rationale regarding competition with active sites is acceptable. However, coverage is limited to a single example (4-oxoheptanedioic acid), suggesting that the rule might require more data points to strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** indicates that acylated amino groups yield low yield due to reduced nucleophilicity. The rationale is acceptable, and the rule adds complexity by considering functional group modification. Coverage is limited to one example ((2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), indicating a need for more supporting data.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** distinguishes yield based on chain length attached to phenolic hydroxyl groups. The rationale about flexibility affecting coordination is reasonable. The rule combines chain length with functional groups, adding complexity. Examples like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (high yield) and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (low yield) support the rule, providing adequate coverage and balance.

  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms do not enhance metal binding. Heteroatoms in aromatic rings can participate in coordination, improving catalyst performance and yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high yield; if the nitrogen-containing ring is not directly attached, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly states that short-chain aliphatic modifiers with coordinating groups yield high yield, while longer chains or distal functional groups yield low yield. The property insight is sound, explaining the role of chain length and coordinating groups in metal interaction. The rule's complexity arises from considering both chain length and functional groups. It is supported by several data points, ensuring good coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in identifying that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups yield high yield. The property insight regarding multiple coordination sites is logical. However, the rule is only supported by one data point (gluconic acid), which limits its coverage and reduces confidence in its general applicability. The simplicity of the rule is good, but the lack of data points affects its overall strength.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic thiol modifiers regarding their yield outcomes. The property insight correctly explains the accessibility and coordinating ability of aliphatic thiols over aromatic thiols. The rule combines substructures (thiol groups on different chains), adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two data points, providing good coverage. The balance between specificity and coverage is well-achieved.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and straightforward, stating that modifiers containing aldehyde groups yield low yield. The property insight is adequate, highlighting the potential formation of inactive complexes or side reactions. The rule is simple and is supported by two data points, ensuring sufficient coverage. The simplicity and coverage provide a good balance.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 addresses the generally low yield of modifiers with ether linkages unless compensated by strong coordinating groups. The rule is clear but complex due to the exceptions. The property insight is reasonable, explaining the weakness of ether oxygen as a donor. It is supported by both low yield examples and a high-yield exception, offering good coverage. The complexity is necessary to account for exceptions, and the balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly states that perfluorinated alkyl chain modifiers yield low yield. The property insight is sound, based on the electronegativity of fluorine reducing coordination ability. However, the rule is supported by only one data point, limiting its coverage and reliability. While the simplicity is advantageous, the lack of data affects the rule's strength.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 effectively differentiates yield based on the presence of coordinating heteroatoms in aromatic side chains of amino acids. The rule is clear and provides good property insight into metal binding capabilities. It combines substructures, adding complexity appropriately.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows for effective chelation with metal ions (such as Fe³⁺), enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. This strong coordination increases the catalyst's efficiency, leading to a higher yield of the reaction.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with substituents capable of strong metal coordination (e.g., amino, nitro groups) yield high yield; those with non-coordinating or electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., methyl, formyl, thiol groups) yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Substituents like amino and nitro groups can donate electron density or coordinate directly with metal centers, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and improving catalytic activity. In contrast, substituents like methyl or formyl groups are non-coordinating and may withdraw electron density from the ring, reducing the ability of the modifier to stabilize the metal catalyst, resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with short aliphatic chains (up to eight carbons) yield high yield if they contain coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups) near the carboxyl end; chains longer than eight carbons or with distal functional groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **octanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Short-chain modifiers with coordinating groups near the carboxyl group can effectively interact with metal centers due to proximity, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity. Simple fatty acids like octanoic acid may increase the hydrophobic environment around the catalyst, improving its performance. Longer chains with functional groups far from the carboxyl group have reduced coordination ability due to steric hindrance and decreased interaction with the metal center, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, especially polyhydroxylated acids, yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination.**
  - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal ions, significantly enhancing metal-ligand interactions. This strong chelation stabilizes the metal catalyst, improving its reactivity and leading to higher yields in the reaction.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yield; thiol groups attached to aromatic rings yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and can effectively coordinate with metal centers through the sulfur atom, forming strong metal-thiol bonds that enhance catalyst performance. In contrast, thiol groups attached to aromatic rings are less available for coordination due to the rigidity of the ring and possible resonance delocalization of the sulfur's lone pair, reducing their coordinating ability and resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential deactivation of the catalyst.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with metal ions or amino groups in the catalyst system, forming Schiff bases or other inactive complexes. This side reaction depletes the active catalyst species and deactivates the catalyst, leading to lower yields in the target reaction.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low yield unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups like multiple hydroxyl or amino groups.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *High Yield Exception*: **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are relatively weak ligands for metal coordination due to their lone pairs being delocalized over adjacent atoms. Modifiers with ether linkages generally do not enhance catalyst performance unless they include additional strong coordinating groups (e.g., multiple hydroxyl groups) that can compensate by providing effective metal-binding sites.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing highly electronegative or electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains) yield low yield.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electron density to the metal center. This results in poor metal-ligand interactions, decreasing catalytic activity and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield low yield unless the aromatic ring contains an additional heteroatom capable of coordination.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms (like in phenylalanine) do not provide additional coordination sites for metal ions and thus do not enhance the catalyst's performance. In contrast, heteroaromatic rings (like the indole ring in tryptophan) contain nitrogen atoms that can coordinate with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high yield; if the nitrogen-containing ring is not directly attached, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: When nitrogen-containing heterocycles are adjacent to the carboxyl group, they can form chelating bidentate ligands with metal ions, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity. If the heterocycle is separated by additional rings or linkers, this chelation is hindered, reducing the modifier's ability to stabilize the metal catalyst and decreasing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing acylated amino groups (e.g., amide linkages) yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation converts amino groups into amides, which are poor ligands for metal coordination due to resonance delocalization of the lone pair on nitrogen. This decreases the modifier's ability to interact with and stabilize the metal catalyst, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains of five carbons yield high yield; shorter chains with phenolic groups yield low yield due to steric constraints.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. Shorter chains limit the mobility of the phenolic group, hindering effective coordination due to steric constraints and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected to carbonyl-containing side chains yield high yield due to enhanced metal interactions.**
  - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatic systems can engage in π-backbonding and coordinate with metal centers through their delocalized π-electron systems. When connected to carbonyl-containing side chains, these modifiers can stabilize the metal catalyst through multiple coordination modes, improving its reactivity and leading to higher yields.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been formulated to accurately describe the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yield. They consider combinations of functional groups and structural motifs, such as the presence of coordinating atoms (nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur), the position and type of substituents on aromatic rings, chain length, and electron-donating or -withdrawing effects. By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on its structure.

The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity. They combine multiple substructures when necessary to reflect the underlying physicochemical properties that influence catalyst performance, such as metal coordination ability, steric factors, and electronic effects. This approach ensures that the rules are comprehensive and can be effectively applied to a wide range of modifiers within the dataset.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions like Fe³⁺. This enhances the stability and reactivity of the catalyst by effectively bridging the metal centers, leading to higher yields in the reaction.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield if the substituent is an amino or nitro group; substituents like methyl, formyl, or thiol groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Amino and nitro groups can coordinate with metal centers or influence electron density favorably, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Methyl and formyl groups are non-coordinating and may withdraw electron density, reducing the modifier's ability to stabilize the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons yield high yield if they contain coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol) near the carboxyl end; longer chains without proximal coordinating groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **octanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Short to medium-chain fatty acids with coordinating groups near the carboxylate can effectively bind metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Longer chains or distal functional groups reduce coordination efficiency due to increased steric hindrance and decreased proximity to the metal site.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination through multiple binding sites.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination points, enabling strong chelation with metal ions. This increases catalyst stability and reactivity, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yield; thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and can form strong bonds with metal centers through the sulfur atom. Aromatic thiols are less effective due to the rigidity of the aromatic system and potential delocalization of the sulfur's lone pair electrons, reducing their coordinating ability.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential deactivation of the catalyst through side reactions.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with amino groups or metal ions in the catalyst system, forming inactive complexes such as Schiff bases. This depletes active catalyst species and reduces reaction yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low yield unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups like multiple hydroxyl or amino groups.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *High Yield Exception*: **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (due to multiple hydroxyl groups).
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weakly coordinating due to their electron lone pairs being delocalized. Additional strong coordinating groups are necessary to enhance metal-ligand interactions and improve catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing highly electronegative or electron-withdrawing substituents, such as perfluoroalkyl groups, yield low yield.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electrons to metal centers. This leads to poor coordination and reduced catalytic performance.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield low yield unless the aromatic ring contains an additional heteroatom capable of coordination (e.g., nitrogen in indole).**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms do not provide additional coordination sites. Heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers through their heteroatoms, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high yield; if the nitrogen-containing ring is separated by additional rings or linkers, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows for effective chelation through bidentate coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Separation by additional structures hinders this interaction, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing acylated amino groups (amide linkages) yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability of the nitrogen atom.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: In amide groups, the lone pair on nitrogen is delocalized with the carbonyl group, making it less available for metal coordination. This weakens the interaction with the catalyst and decreases yield.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains of five carbons yield high yield; shorter chains with phenolic groups yield low yield due to steric constraints and reduced flexibility.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. Shorter chains limit mobility and hinder coordination, reducing catalytic performance.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected to carbonyl-containing side chains yield high yield due to enhanced interactions with metal centers.**
  - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatics can participate in π-interactions with metal centers, and adjacent carbonyl groups can further coordinate metals, enhancing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing acyl or trifluoroacetyl groups adjacent to potential coordinating atoms yield low yield.**
  - *Examples*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on potential coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to bind metal ions and decreasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with multiple methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yield due to increased electron density and enhanced metal coordination ability.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are electron-donating, increasing the electron density of the aromatic ring and enhancing its ability to interact with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been formulated to capture the relationships between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. They incorporate combinations of functional groups and structural motifs, such as:

- **Coordinating Functional Groups**: Amino, hydroxyl, thiol, and nitro groups that can coordinate with metal centers.
- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: The length of aliphatic chains and the position of functional groups affect the ability of the modifier to interact with the catalyst.
- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups enhance coordination by increasing electron density, while electron-withdrawing groups decrease coordination ability.
- **Steric Factors**: The spatial arrangement of functional groups influences the modifier's effectiveness in stabilizing the catalyst.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield based on its structure. The rules balance simplicity and complexity, providing broader coverage of the dataset while highlighting specific structural features that critically influence reaction outcomes.

**Note**: These rules consider underlying physicochemical properties such as metal coordination ability, electronic effects, and steric factors. They have been refined to improve accuracy and applicability across a broader range of modifiers in the dataset, ensuring effective guidance for predicting reaction yields.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows these molecules to chelate metal ions effectively through multiple coordination sites. This enhances the stability and reactivity of the catalyst by facilitating stronger metal-ligand interactions.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield if the substituent is an amino or nitro group; substituents like methyl or formyl groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Amino and nitro groups can engage in coordination with metal centers or alter electron density favorably, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Non-coordinating groups like methyl or formyl do not contribute to metal coordination and may decrease electron density, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination through multiple binding sites.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination points, enabling strong chelation with metal ions. This strengthens the catalyst's stability and increases its reactivity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains bearing amino or thiol groups yield high yield when the chain length is optimal (3 to 6 carbons).**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal chain lengths allow coordinating groups to effectively interact with metal centers without excessive steric hindrance. Longer chains may reduce coordination efficiency due to increased flexibility and distance from the metal center.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group allows for effective bidentate coordination with metal ions, enhancing catalyst interaction. Additional linkers or rings can hinder this coordination, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can react with nucleophilic sites in the catalyst system or form inactive complexes with metal ions, reducing the availability of active catalyst species and lowering the reaction yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl or trifluoromethyl chains yield low yield.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on potential coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electrons to metal centers and resulting in poor metal-ligand interactions.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield high yield if the side chain contains heteroatoms capable of coordination; otherwise, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack additional coordination sites and do not contribute to catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached to aliphatic chains yield high yield when the chain provides sufficient flexibility (chain length of 4 carbons or more).**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains offer flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. Shorter chains limit mobility and hinder such interactions.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability of the nitrogen atom.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: In amide groups, the lone pair on the nitrogen is delocalized with the carbonyl group, making it less available for metal coordination. This weakens the interaction with the catalyst and decreases the reaction yield.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** is clear and allows for unambiguous identification of modifiers fitting the description—specifically, α-amino dicarboxylic acids. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining that the presence of both an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups enhances metal chelation, leading to improved catalyst stability and reactivity. The rule effectively combines multiple sub-structures, adding necessary complexity. It is supported by at least two data points—(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid—both yielding high yield. The rule strikes a good balance between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** is clearly defined, specifying para-substituted benzoic acids with particular substituents yielding high or low yield based on their ability to coordinate with metal centers. The rule provides solid physical-chemical insight by contrasting coordinating groups (amino, nitro) with non-coordinating groups (methyl, formyl). It considers combinations of sub-structures—functional groups attached to an aromatic ring—adding appropriate complexity. The rule is well-supported by data: high yield examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid, while low yield examples are 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid. This balance between complexity and coverage enhances its effectiveness.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** is clear in its requirement for modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups. The physical-chemical insight is convincing, attributing high yield to enhanced metal coordination through multiple binding sites provided by the hydroxyl groups. The rule adds complexity by focusing on the presence of several hydroxyl groups rather than just one. It is supported by at least two data points: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid, both yielding high yield. The rule balances specificity with sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** is clear, associating high yield with modifiers that have optimal aliphatic chain lengths (3 to 6 carbons) bearing amino or thiol groups. The physical-chemical insight is logical, explaining how chain length affects the ability of coordinating groups to interact with metal centers without steric hindrance. The rule incorporates complexity by considering both functional groups and chain length. It is supported by examples such as 5-aminopentanoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield), and 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid (low yield). This provides a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** clearly specifies that nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring. The physical-chemical insight is solid, highlighting the importance of direct attachment for effective bidentate coordination. The rule combines considerations of ring structure and functional group positioning, adding complexity. It is supported by high yield examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and a low yield example, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, enhancing coverage and demonstrating the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** is clear in identifying modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid as yielding low yield. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, explaining potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions involving these groups. The rule's complexity lies in its focus on specific functional group arrangements. Supported by low yield examples—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—it has adequate coverage. The balance between specificity and the number of applicable data points is acceptable.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** plainly states that modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl or trifluoromethyl chains yield low yield. The physical-chemical rationale is sound, as electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density necessary for metal coordination. While the rule is less complex, focusing on a single type of substituent, it is supported by data points such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid. The simplicity of the rule is balanced by its clear applicability and coverage.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** is somewhat complex, specifying that amino acids with aromatic side chains yield high yield if the side chain contains coordinating heteroatoms. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, emphasizing the role of heteroatoms in coordination. The rule requires knowledge of amino acid structures but is clear for those familiar with them. It is supported by (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan) yielding high yield and (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine) yielding low yield. This provides sufficient coverage, balancing complexity with practical applicability.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** is clear in its criteria: modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached to sufficiently flexible aliphatic chains (length of 4 carbons or more) yield high yield. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, relating chain flexibility to effective coordination. The rule combines considerations of functional groups and chain length, adding necessary complexity. Supported by data—5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yields high yield, while 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yields low yield—it offers good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** is clear, stating that modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability of the nitrogen atom. The physical-chemical insight is logical, explaining how acylation affects nitrogen's electron-donating ability. However, the rule's complexity is limited, focusing on a specific modification of the amino group. It is supported by only one data point—(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid—raising concerns about coverage. Additional supporting examples would strengthen the rule and improve its balance between complexity and coverage.

Electron-withdrawing or non-coordinating groups like methyl, formyl, or sulfanyl do not contribute effectively, reducing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with carbon chain lengths between 4 and 8 yield high yield, especially when unbranched and lacking additional functional groups.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length may facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst surface or active sites, possibly through hydrophobic effects, without steric hindrance from additional functional groups.

  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in aromatic side chains (e.g., nitrogen in indole rings) provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic side chains lacking such heteroatoms do not offer this advantage.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yield; modifiers with single or distal hydroxyl groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid enhance chelation with metal centers due to multiple bonding sites. Hydroxyl groups that are distant or fewer in number offer limited coordination, reducing effectiveness.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low yield due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of amino groups diminishes their nucleophilicity and ability to coordinate with metal centers, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocyclic ring without additional linkers.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to the heterocycle enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing catalyst interactions. Additional linkers or aromatic rings can disrupt optimal coordination geometry.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions when appropriately positioned, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may interact differently, potentially leading to catalyst poisoning or less effective coordination.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (greater than 6 carbons) bearing amino or hydroxyl groups yield low yield due to decreased coordination efficiency.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Extended chain length separates the functional group from the carboxylic acid, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination and diminishing the modifier's ability to enhance catalyst performance.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with extensive methoxy substitutions on aromatic rings yield high yield due to increased electron-donating effects enhancing metal coordination.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are strong electron donors, increasing electron density on the aromatic ring and adjacent functional groups, which can improve metal-ligand interactions critical for catalysis.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups such as sulfides or methylthioethers can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional functional groups yield high yield when the chain length is optimal (typically 6 to 8 carbons).**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.

7. **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains yield low yields due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

   - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms (e.g., oxygen in carboxyl groups) to donate electron density to metal ions, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

8. **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yields; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions when appropriately positioned, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may interact differently, potentially leading to catalyst poisoning or less effective coordination.

9. **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yields due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Reactive aldehyde groups may form irreversible adducts with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalytic sites.

10. **Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yields when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocycle; those with additional aromatic rings or linkers yield low yields.**

    - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to the heterocycle enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing catalyst interactions. Additional linkers or aromatic rings can disrupt optimal coordination geometry.

11. **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yields due to increased electron density enhancing metal coordination.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are strong electron donors, increasing electron density on the aromatic ring and adjacent functional groups, which can improve metal-ligand interactions critical for catalysis.

12. **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated yield low yields due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Acylation of amino groups diminishes their nucleophilicity and ability to coordinate with metal centers, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

13. **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yields due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups such as sulfides or methylthioethers can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

14. **Modifiers with oxo (carbonyl) groups within a rigid aromatic framework yield high yields; similar modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains yield low yields.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Rigid structures facilitate effective coordination due to fixed geometry, while flexibility can impede proper alignment of coordinating groups with the metal center.

15. **Modifiers combining flexible ether linkages and terminal amino groups yield low yields due to excessive flexibility hindering effective coordination.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: The combination of ether linkages and amino groups introduces too much flexibility, preventing effective simultaneous coordination necessary for enhancing catalyst performance.

    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are strong electron donors, increasing electron density on the aromatic ring and adjacent functional groups, which can improve metal-ligand interactions critical for catalysis. However, insufficient number or improper positioning may not provide the desired effect.

12. **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated yield low yields due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**

- **Comment 6**: This rule clearly identifies modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl chains, as yielding low yields. The rationale explains how decreased electron density on coordinating atoms weakens metal-ligand interactions. Complexity is present by considering specific functional groups. Coverage is adequate with examples like 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid (both low yield).

- **Comment 7**: The rule clearly distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic modifiers containing thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid. The rationale provides insight into potential catalyst poisoning by aromatic thiols. Complexity is addressed by considering both the functional group and the structural context (aliphatic vs. aromatic). Coverage is sufficient with examples like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield).

- **Comment 8**: This rule clearly states that modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yields due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions. The rationale offers adequate physicochemical insight. Complexity is acceptable, focusing on a specific functional group. Coverage is adequate with low yield examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Comment 9**: The rule is clear in stating that nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yields when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocycle, whereas additional aromatic rings or linkers yield low yields. The rationale provides property insight into effective bidentate coordination enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Complexity is present by considering structural connectivity. Coverage is sufficient with examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (high yield) versus 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (low yield).

- **Comment 10**: This rule clearly indicates that amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms yield high yields, while those without heteroatoms yield low yields. The rationale offers physicochemical insight into the importance of additional coordination sites. Complexity is addressed by combining amino acid structure with side-chain functional groups. Coverage is adequate with examples like tryptophan (high yield) and phenylalanine (low yield).

- **Comment 11**: The rule states that modifiers where amino groups are acylated yield low yields. The rationale explains how acylation reduces the availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination. While the rule is clear and offers property insight, coverage is limited with only one supporting data point (6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid). Additional data points are needed to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 12**: This rule mentions that modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings can yield high yields, with the position and number of methoxy groups being important. The rationale provides some insight but could be elaborated. Complexity is present by considering substituent type and positioning. Coverage is limited with one high yield example and one low yield example; more data points would enhance the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 13**: The rule clearly states that modifiers with rigid aromatic systems containing additional carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high yields. The rationale offers physicochemical insight into how rigid structures with multiple coordination sites enhance metal binding. Complexity is addressed through the combination of structural features. However, coverage is limited with only one high yield example (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid); more supporting data would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 14**: This rule clearly indicates that modifiers with terminal amino groups on flexible aliphatic chains yield low yields due to ineffective coordination. The rationale provides adequate insight. Complexity is acceptable, focusing on chain flexibility and functional group positioning. Coverage is sufficient with supporting examples like 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid (both low yield).

- **Comment 15**: The rule states that amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yields due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation. While the rationale is reasonable, coverage is limited with only one low yield example provided (2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid). Additional data points are necessary to validate this rule fully.
