**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic acids) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**Glutamic acid**), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**Aspartic acid**).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and dual carboxyl groups allows for strong chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity, which increases the yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating substituents at the para position yield high value; those with electron-donating or non-coordinating substituents yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups like amino, nitro, and bromomethyl enhance metal binding by increasing the acidity of the carboxyl group and providing additional coordination sites. Electron-donating groups like methyl reduce metal coordination, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with amino groups located within five carbons of the carboxyl group yield high value; those with amino groups farther away or acylated yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl enhances chelation with metal centers. Distant or acylated amino groups are less effective in metal coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**Gluconic acid**), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal ions and facilitate hydrogen bonding, enhancing metal complexation and improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing thiol (sulfhydryl) groups yield high value when the thiol is on an aliphatic chain; those with sulfur attached to aromatic rings or in thioethers yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Sulfur in aromatic systems or thioethers is less accessible for coordination due to steric hindrance or delocalization.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or form inactive complexes with metal ions, deactivating the catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: The electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination and decreasing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (**Niacin**), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as strong chelating agents with metal centers, enhancing coordination and improving catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low value unless additional strong coordinating groups are present.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weak donors for metal coordination. Without additional coordinating groups, the overall metal-binding ability is insufficient to enhance catalytic performance.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (with eight or more carbons) yield high value unless they contain interfering functional groups.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may improve substrate accessibility and stabilize the catalyst. Interfering groups (like distant amino groups) can disrupt metal coordination, reducing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups near the carboxyl group yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can chelate with metal centers in a way that competes with the active site or alters the catalyst structure, leading to decreased catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value only when additional coordinating groups are present.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density and can enhance metal interactions when coupled with other coordinating groups. Without them, the coordination is insufficient to impact the yield positively.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached via a five-carbon aliphatic chain yield high value; those with shorter chains yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl to effectively coordinate with the metal center. Shorter chains limit this interaction due to steric constraints.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of the amino group reduces its availability for metal coordination, diminishing its ability to enhance catalyst activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing amino groups directly attached to aromatic rings yield high value; those with amino groups on aliphatic chains yield high value only when the chain is short.**
  - *High Yield Example (Aromatic Amino Group)*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**.
  - *High Yield Example (Short Aliphatic Chain)**: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example**: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale**: Aromatic amino groups enhance metal coordination due to conjugation with the ring. Aliphatic amino groups are effective when close to the carboxyl group, enabling strong chelation; distant amino groups are less effective.
