- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains (containing both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups) yield high value**. This includes amino acids like glutamic acid and aspartic acid.
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid).
  - *Rationale*: The additional carboxylic acid groups may enhance metal coordination and catalyst stability, improving yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with an amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin).
  - *Rationale*: The amino group can act as an electron-donating group, enhancing interaction with the catalyst's metal center.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing a pyridine ring directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.
  - *Rationale*: The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (with carbon chain lengths of six or more) yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: Octanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains may increase hydrophobic interactions and optimize the catalyst's microenvironment.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino or hydroxy groups) on an aromatic ring, especially at the para position, yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups enhance the electron density of the aromatic ring, facilitating better catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro groups) on an aromatic ring yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups can stabilize intermediate species, improving reaction yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may react with catalyst components, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple fluorine atoms or perfluorinated chains yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative, which may disrupt catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine).
  - *Rationale*: Hydrophobic aromatic side chains may not interact favorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with amino groups located on long aliphatic chains (far from the carboxylic acid group) yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Distant amino groups may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups attached to an aliphatic chain yield high value**, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring yield low value.
  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols can enhance metal binding, but aromatic thiols may lead to catalyst poisoning.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with ketone (carbonyl) groups on aliphatic chains yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Ketone groups may interfere with catalyst activity by forming undesirable complexes.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyrazole, indole) directly attached to carboxyl groups yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan).
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains yield variable results and cannot be reliably predicted by this rule set**.
  - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (Low Yield), 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid (High Yield).
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages may or may not favorably interact with the catalyst depending on the overall structure.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value when combined with additional functional groups**.
  - *Examples*: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are electron-donating and can enhance aromatic ring interactions with the catalyst.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows us to easily determine whether a modifier matches the description of amino acids with acidic side chains (containing both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups). The property insight is strong, as the additional carboxylic acid groups may enhance metal coordination and catalyst stability, improving yield. The rule considers a combination of functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two data points—(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid—meeting the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 lacks clarity due to inconsistencies between the description and examples. While it mentions modifiers with an amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring, one of the examples provided, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, does not have an amino group but a nitrogen atom in the ring. This mismatch reduces clarity. The property insight is weakened by this inconsistency. Coverage is limited, and the rule may not reliably predict outcomes, suggesting a need for refinement.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in specifying modifiers containing a pyridine ring directly attached to the carboxyl group, yielding high value. The property insight is solid, as the nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers. It considers specific structural features, adding complexity. Supported by data points like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (high yield), it meets the coverage criterion. However, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yields low value, indicating that additional structural factors may influence the outcome, suggesting the rule might need adjustments for broader applicability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and straightforward, focusing on long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (carbon chain lengths of six or more) yielding high value. The property insight is reasonable, relating to hydrophobic interactions enhancing catalyst microenvironment. While octanoic acid supports the rule (high yield), 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid yields low value, implying that additional functional groups (like hydroxyl groups) can influence results. The rule's simplicity limits complexity, and coverage is moderate. Overall, it balances simplicity and applicability effectively.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is moderately clear but could benefit from more specificity regarding the positions of electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring. The property insight is valid, as electron-donating groups can enhance catalyst interaction. Supported by 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (high yield), it shows that placement matters. However, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yields low value, suggesting that chain length or additional structural elements affect the outcome. The rule captures complexity by considering group positions but has limited coverage due to conflicting data.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, stating that modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups on an aromatic ring yield high value. The property insight is somewhat counterintuitive but plausible if such groups stabilize intermediates. Supported by 4-nitrobenzoic acid (high yield), the rule has limited coverage with few data points. It focuses on a single functional group, keeping complexity low. Additional data would strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and well-supported, stating that modifiers containing aldehyde groups yield low value. The property insight is strong, as aldehyde groups may deactivate the catalyst. Supported by 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (both low yield), it meets the coverage criterion. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, with the property insight that fluorinated groups may disrupt catalyst interactions. Supported by 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid (low yield), the rule has limited coverage due to a single data point. Complexity is low, focusing on specific functional groups. More data would enhance its reliability.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear, indicating that amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains yield low value. The property insight is sound, as such side chains may not interact favorably with the catalyst. Supported by (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (low yield), it meets the coverage criterion. The rule balances complexity by considering both amino acid nature and side-chain properties.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, with the property insight that distant amino groups may not coordinate effectively with active sites. Supported by 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid (both low yield), it satisfies coverage requirements. The rule addresses complexity by considering the spatial arrangement of functional groups.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and detailed, distinguishing between thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) and those directly attached to aromatic rings (low yield). The property insight is strong, and the rule is supported by 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield). It effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear, stating that modifiers with ketone groups on aliphatic chains yield low value. The property insight is acceptable, as ketone groups may interfere with catalyst activity. Supported by 4-oxoheptanedioic acid (low yield), coverage is limited but adequate. The rule is specific, maintaining appropriate complexity.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear, indicating that modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles attached to carboxyl groups yield high value. The property insight is solid, with nitrogen heterocycles enhancing coordination. Supported by 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (both high yield), it meets coverage criteria. The rule effectively incorporates complexity.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 acknowledges variability with modifiers containing ether linkages, which is clear and honest about prediction limitations. The property insight recognizes that other structural factors influence outcomes. Supported by examples yielding both high and low values, the rule accepts complexity and coverage issues.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 lacks clarity due to vague references to "additional functional groups." The property insight is incomplete without specifying which groups enhance yield. Supported only by 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (high yield), coverage is limited. Complexity is high but not balanced by sufficient data. The rule requires refinement for better applicability.

  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may react with catalyst components, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple fluorine atoms or perfluorinated chains yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative, which may disrupt catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine).
  - *Rationale*: Hydrophobic aromatic side chains may not interact favorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with amino groups located on long aliphatic chains (far from the carboxylic acid group) yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Distant amino groups may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups attached to an aliphatic chain yield high value**, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring yield low value.
  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols can enhance metal binding, but aromatic thiols may lead to catalyst poisoning.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with ketone (carbonyl) groups on aliphatic chains yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Ketone groups may interfere with catalyst activity by forming undesirable complexes.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyrazole, indole) directly attached to carboxyl groups yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan).
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains yield variable results and cannot be reliably predicted by this rule set**.
  - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (Low Yield), 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid (High Yield).
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages may or may not favorably interact with the catalyst depending on the overall structure.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value when combined with additional functional groups**.
  - *Examples*: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are electron-donating and can enhance aromatic ring interactions with the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **For Rule 3**, which aims to identify modifiers containing a pyridine ring directly attached to the carboxyl group, the SMARTS pattern in the code is too specific and incorrectly structured. The current pattern `pyridine_carboxylic_acid = '[n][c]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[c][c][c][c]'` assumes the carboxyl group is directly attached to a specific carbon in the pyridine ring, which may not match molecules like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid or pyridine-2-carboxylic acid. To accurately capture any pyridine ring with a carboxylic acid attached at any position, the SMARTS pattern should be generalized. **Suggested improvement**: Use a pattern like `'[n]1ccccc1C(=O)[O,H]'`, which matches any pyridine ring with a carboxyl group attached to it, regardless of the position.

- **Suggestion 2**: **For Rule 13**, which focuses on modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxyl groups (e.g., pyrazole, indole), the current pattern `nitrogen_heterocycle_carboxylic_acid = '[n][c][c][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` is too specific and may only match certain heterocycles like pyridine. This pattern fails to match other nitrogen heterocycles like pyrazole or indole. **Suggested improvement**: Modify the pattern to `'[n][#6]*[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`, which looks for any nitrogen atom in a heterocycle connected (via any number of carbons) to a carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 3**: **For Rule 5**, intended to detect modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino or hydroxy groups) on an aromatic ring, especially at the para position, the current patterns are too restrictive. They require a specific arrangement of atoms and only match molecules where the electron-donating group is at a specific position relative to the carboxylic acid. **Suggested improvement**: Generalize the SMARTS patterns to match any aromatic ring with an electron-donating group attached. For example, use patterns like `'[$(c[OH]),$(c[NH2])][c]:[c]:[c]:[c]:[c]'` to match an aromatic ring with a hydroxy or amino group at any position.

- **Suggestion 4**: **For Rule 9**, which targets amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains yielding low values, the pattern `aromatic_amino_acid = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX4][c]'` may not accurately capture all such amino acids. For instance, this pattern misses molecules where the aromatic ring is further down the chain. **Suggested improvement**: Expand the pattern to include longer side chains before the aromatic ring, such as `'[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX4][CX4][c]'`, or use a more flexible pattern that allows for varying chain lengths leading to an aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 5**: **For Rule 10**, which is about modifiers with amino groups located on long aliphatic chains far from the carboxylic acid group yielding low values, the current pattern `distant_amino_group = '[NX3;H2,H1][#6][#6][#6][#6][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` may not correctly identify molecules where the amino group is further than four carbons away or in different positions. **Suggested improvement**: Modify the pattern to detect amino groups on aliphatic chains of six carbons or more, regardless of their exact position, such as `'[NX3;H2,H1][CX4]~[CX4]~[CX4]~[CX4]~[CX4]~[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 6**: **For Rule 5 and Rule 6**, consider using wildcard positions for substituents on the aromatic ring to account for ortho, meta, and para positions. Use patterns that detect electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups at any position on the aromatic ring. For example, for electron-donating groups, use `'c[cX3;$([OH]),$([NH2])]c'` to match hydroxy or amino groups on any carbon in the ring.

- **Suggestion 7**: **For Rule 11**, which distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic thiols, the patterns may be too simplistic. The current patterns are `aliphatic_thiol = '[#6][SX2H]'` and `aromatic_thiol = '[c][SX2H]'`. These patterns might not account for all aliphatic thiols or may incorrectly classify compounds. **Suggested improvement**: Use more precise patterns, such as `'[CX4][SX2H]'` for aliphatic thiols and `'[cH][SX2H]'` for aromatic thiols, to ensure accurate classification.

- **Suggestion 8**: **For Rule 4**, concerning long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids, the pattern `long_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[CH3][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` only matches a specific chain length and may miss longer chains (more than six carbons). **Suggested improvement**: Use a more general pattern that matches aliphatic chains of six or more carbons, such as `'[CH3][CH2]{5,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`, where `{5,}` indicates five or more CH2 groups.

- **Suggestion 9**: **For Rule 6**, which focuses on electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro groups) on aromatic rings, the current pattern `ewg_on_aromatic = '[c][c][c]([NX3](=O)=O)[c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` is overly specific and may not match molecules with nitro groups in different positions. **Suggested improvement**: Generalize the pattern to detect nitro groups on any position of the aromatic ring, such as `'[c][c]([NX3](=O)=O)[c][c][c]'`.

- **Suggestion 10**: **For Rule 12**, which deals with ketone groups on aliphatic chains yielding low values, the pattern `aliphatic_ketone = '[#6][CX3](=O)[#6]'` may match any ketone, including those in aromatic systems or cyclic ketones. **Suggested improvement**: Refine the pattern to specifically match ketones on linear aliphatic chains, such as `'[CX4][CX3](=O)[CX4]'`, ensuring both carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are sp3 hybridized.

- **Suggestion 11**: **For Rule 15**, which seeks modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings combined with additional functional groups yielding high values, the current pattern `methoxy_on_aromatic = '[c][c][c]([OX2][CH3])[c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` may be too restrictive. It requires the methoxy group to be at a specific position relative to the carboxylic acid and may not match molecules with other functional groups. **Suggested improvement**: Use a more flexible pattern like `'c[OCH3]'` to detect methoxy groups on any position of an aromatic ring and combine it with a pattern that allows for additional functional groups.

- **Suggestion 12**: **General Suggestion**: Review all SMARTS patterns to ensure they are not overly specific and that they accurately represent the chemical features described in the natural language rules. Consider using recursive SMARTS or adding variability to match different substituent positions and chain lengths where appropriate.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Debugging Aid**: Implement code to log or print the molecules that match each pattern during execution. This will help identify which molecules are matching or not matching the SMARTS patterns and adjust the patterns accordingly.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains (containing both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups) yield high value**. This includes amino acids like glutamic acid and aspartic acid.
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid).
  - *Rationale*: The additional carboxylic acid groups may enhance metal coordination and catalyst stability, improving yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with an amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin).
  - *Rationale*: The amino group can act as an electron-donating group, enhancing interaction with the catalyst's metal center.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing a pyridine ring directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.
  - *Rationale*: The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (with carbon chain lengths of six or more) yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: Octanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains may increase hydrophobic interactions and optimize the catalyst's microenvironment.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino or hydroxy groups) on an aromatic ring, especially at the para position, yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups enhance the electron density of the aromatic ring, facilitating better catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro groups) on an aromatic ring yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups can stabilize intermediate species, improving reaction yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may react with catalyst components, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple fluorine atoms or perfluorinated chains yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative, which may disrupt catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine).
  - *Rationale*: Hydrophobic aromatic side chains may not interact favorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with amino groups located on long aliphatic chains (far from the carboxylic acid group) yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Distant amino groups may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups attached to an aliphatic chain yield high value**, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring yield low value.
  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols can enhance metal binding, but aromatic thiols may lead to catalyst poisoning.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with ketone (carbonyl) groups on aliphatic chains yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Ketone groups may interfere with catalyst activity by forming undesirable complexes.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyrazole, indole) directly attached to carboxyl groups yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan).
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains yield variable results and cannot be reliably predicted by this rule set**.
  - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (Low Yield), 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid (High Yield).
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages may or may not favorably interact with the catalyst depending on the overall structure.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value when combined with additional functional groups**.
  - *Examples*: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are electron-donating and can enhance aromatic ring interactions with the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **For Rule 4**, the SMARTS pattern `long_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[CH3][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` matches only aliphatic chains with exactly six carbons before the carboxylic acid group. This does not align with the rule, which specifies chains of six **or more** carbons. To correct this, modify the pattern to allow for chains of variable length (six or more carbons). You can use a repetition qualifier in the SMARTS pattern:

  ```python
  long_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[CH3][CH2]{5,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  This pattern matches a methyl group `[CH3]` followed by five or more methylene groups `[CH2]{5,}`, ending with a carboxylic acid group. This adjustment ensures that molecules like octanoic acid (`CCCCCCCC(=O)O`) are correctly identified by Rule 4.

- **Suggestion 2**: **For Rule 5**, the current SMARTS patterns:

  ```python
  edg_on_aromatic = ['[c][OX2H]', '[c][NX3;H2,H1]']
  ```

  may not capture all modifiers with electron-donating groups on an aromatic ring. Specifically, they only match electron-donating groups directly attached to an aromatic carbon, and may miss substituents in positions other than where the aromatic carbon is directly connected. To improve this:

  - Modify the patterns to include atoms connected through one bond to the aromatic ring, capturing para, meta, and ortho substitutions:

    ```python
    edg_on_aromatic = ['[c][c][OX2H]', '[c][c][NX3;H2,H1]', '[c][c][OX2][CH3]', '[c][c][NX3H0]([CH3])[CH3]']
    ```

  - Alternatively, use a more general pattern that searches for any aromatic ring with an electron-donating group attached:

    ```python
    edg_on_aromatic = ['c[cX3;$([cX3][OX2H]),$([cX3][NX3;H2,H1]),$([cX3][OX2][CH3])]']
    ```

  - Ensure methoxy groups (`-OCH3`) are included by adding the pattern `'[c][OX2][CH3]'`.

- **Suggestion 3**: **For Rule 6**, the patterns for electron-withdrawing groups on an aromatic ring:

  ```python
  ewg_on_aromatic = ['[c][NX3](=O)=O', '[c][F,Cl,Br,I]']
  ```

  may not cover all common electron-withdrawing groups. To broaden the scope:

  - Include additional electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl (`-C(=O)-`), cyano (`-C#N`), and sulfonyl (`-S(=O)2-`):

    ```python
    ewg_on_aromatic = ['[c][CX3](=O)[#6]', '[c][CX2]#N', '[c][SX4](=O)(=O)[#6]', '[c][NX3](=O)=O', '[c][F,Cl,Br,I]']
    ```

- **Suggestion 4**: **For Rule 9**, the pattern:

  ```python
  aromatic_amino_acid = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX4][c]'
  ```

  may not accurately capture amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine). This pattern assumes a specific chain length and may miss amino acids where the aromatic ring is more than two carbons away from the amino group. To improve this:

  - Modify the pattern to allow variable chain lengths between the amino group and the aromatic ring:

    ```python
    aromatic_amino_acid = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX4][CX4][#6]~*~[c]'
    ```

  - Alternatively, use a recursive SMARTS pattern to match any amino acid with an aromatic side chain:

    ```python
    aromatic_amino_acid = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][$([CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])][CX4;$([CX4][c])]'
    ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **For Rule 11**, the code currently handles aliphatic and aromatic thiols separately using:

  ```python
  aliphatic_thiol = '[CX4][SX2H]'
  aromatic_thiol = '[c][SX2H]'
  ```

  However, the aliphatic thiol pattern may miss thiols attached to secondary or tertiary carbons. To capture all aliphatic thiols, modify the pattern to:

  ```python
  aliphatic_thiol = '[CX4][SX2H]'
  ```

  and ensure it includes secondary and tertiary carbons. Additionally, validate that the code correctly applies the `alternate_prediction` for aromatic thiols.

- **Suggestion 6**: **For Rule 13**, the pattern:

  ```python
  nitrogen_heterocycle_carboxylic_acid = '[n][#6]*[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  may not match nitrogen heterocycles where the carboxyl group is attached directly to the ring without an intervening carbon. To correct this, adjust the pattern to:

  ```python
  nitrogen_heterocycle_carboxylic_acid = '[n][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  or include an optional chain between the nitrogen heterocycle and the carboxyl group:

  ```python
  nitrogen_heterocycle_carboxylic_acid = '[n][#6]?[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 7**: **For Rule 15**, the pattern:

  ```python
  methoxy_on_aromatic = '[c][OX2][CH3]'
  ```

  may not match methoxy groups on aromatic rings if the methoxy group is connected via a single bond to the ring (as in anisole). Ensure that the pattern captures the oxygen connected to the aromatic ring:

  ```python
  methoxy_on_aromatic = '[c][OX2][CH3]'
  ```

  Also, consider that additional functional groups are required for high yield, so the code should check for their presence.

- **Suggestion 8**: **General Code Improvement**:

  - Ensure that all SMARTS patterns are correctly compiled and handle exceptions where patterns do not compile, perhaps by logging or alerting for correction.
  
  - Use RDKit's recursive SMARTS or adjust the patterns to be more inclusive where appropriate.
  
  - For each rule, verify that the `count` parameter is appropriate. For example, some functional groups may appear multiple times, or only once, and this should be reflected in the `count`.
  
  - Consider adding unit tests or validation steps to check that known molecules (from the examples) are correctly matched by the rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains (containing both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups) yield high value**. This includes amino acids like glutamic acid and aspartic acid.
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid).
  - *Rationale*: The additional carboxylic acid groups may enhance metal coordination and catalyst stability, improving yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with an amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin).
  - *Rationale*: The amino group can act as an electron-donating group, enhancing interaction with the catalyst's metal center.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing a pyridine ring directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.
  - *Rationale*: The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (with carbon chain lengths of six or more) yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: Octanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains may increase hydrophobic interactions and optimize the catalyst's microenvironment.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino or hydroxy groups) on an aromatic ring, especially at the para position, yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups enhance the electron density of the aromatic ring, facilitating better catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro groups) on an aromatic ring yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups can stabilize intermediate species, improving reaction yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may react with catalyst components, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple fluorine atoms or perfluorinated chains yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative, which may disrupt catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine).
  - *Rationale*: Hydrophobic aromatic side chains may not interact favorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with amino groups located on long aliphatic chains (far from the carboxylic acid group) yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Distant amino groups may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups attached to an aliphatic chain yield high value**, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring yield low value.
  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols can enhance metal binding, but aromatic thiols may lead to catalyst poisoning.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with ketone (carbonyl) groups on aliphatic chains yield low value**.
  - *Examples*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Ketone groups may interfere with catalyst activity by forming undesirable complexes.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyrazole, indole) directly attached to carboxyl groups yield high value**.
  - *Examples*: 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan).
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains yield variable results and cannot be reliably predicted by this rule set**.
  - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (Low Yield), 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid (High Yield).
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages may or may not favorably interact with the catalyst depending on the overall structure.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value when combined with additional functional groups**.
  - *Examples*: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are electron-donating and can enhance aromatic ring interactions with the catalyst.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Improve Rule 3 SMARTS Pattern**

  The current SMARTS pattern for **Rule 3** is:

  ```python
  pyridine_carboxylic_acid = '[n]1ccccc1C(=O)[O;H,-]'
  ```

  This pattern is too specific and only matches pyridine carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is attached at a specific position on the pyridine ring (position 1). As a result, it misses other pyridine carboxylic acids like nicotinic acid (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid).

  **Improvement**:

  Use a more general pattern that matches any pyridine ring with a carboxyl group directly attached to it, regardless of the position. You can modify the pattern as follows:

  ```python
  pyridine_carboxylic_acid = '[n][c]1cccc1C(=O)[O;H,-]'
  ```

  Or even more generally:

  ```python
  pyridine_carboxylic_acid = '[n]1cccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])c1'
  ```

  This pattern ensures that any carboxyl group directly attached to any position on the pyridine ring is matched.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct Rule 4 SMARTS Pattern**

  The current SMARTS pattern for **Rule 4** is:

  ```python
  long_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[CH3][CH2]{5,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  This pattern may not match molecules like octanoic acid because it requires exactly one methyl group at the beginning. However, in some long-chain carboxylic acids, the chain may be part of a larger structure or may not start with a methyl group.

  **Improvement**:

  Make the pattern more flexible by allowing any number of carbon atoms (six or more) in the aliphatic chain, regardless of the starting group. You can adjust the pattern as follows:

  ```python
  long_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[CX4;!$(C=O)]([CH2]){5,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  Or to include any aliphatic chain with six or more carbons ending with a carboxylic acid:

  ```python
  long_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[#6]~[CH2]~[CH2]~[CH2]~[CH2]~[CH2]~[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  This pattern matches any carbon chain (linear or branched) with six or more carbon atoms leading to a carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Expand Rule 5 Electron-Donating Groups**

  In **Rule 5**, the patterns for electron-donating groups (EDGs) on aromatic rings are:

  ```python
  edg_on_aromatic = [
      '[c][OX2H]',
      '[c][NX3;H2,H1]',
      '[c][OX2][CH3]',
      '[c][NX3H0]([CH3])[CH3]',
      '[c][c][OX2H]',
      '[c][c][NX3;H2,H1]',
      '[c][c][OX2][CH3]',
      '[c][c][NX3H0]([CH3])[CH3]'
  ]
  ```

  These patterns may not capture all possible EDGs, especially those at the para position or other positions on the aromatic ring.

  **Improvement**:

  Include patterns that match EDGs at different positions on the aromatic ring. You can use recursive SMARTS or make the patterns more general:

  ```python
  edg_on_aromatic = [
      '[c][c]([c][c][c][c])[OX2H]',       # Hydroxy group on aromatic ring
      '[c][c]([c][c][c][c])[NX3;H2,H1]',  # Amino group on aromatic ring
      '[c][c]([c][c][c][c])[OX2][CH3]',   # Methoxy group on aromatic ring
      '[c][c]([c][c][c][c])[NX3H0]([CH3])[CH3]'  # Dimethylamino group on aromatic ring
  ]
  ```

  Also, consider including patterns that match EDGs in any position on the aromatic ring:

  ```python
  edg_on_aromatic = [
      '[c][c;R1][c;R1][c;R1][c;R1][c;R1][OX2H]',
      '[c][c;R1][c;R1][c;R1][c;R1][c;R1][NX3;H2,H1]',
      '[c][OX2H]',
      '[c][NX3;H2,H1]',
      '[c][OX2][CH3]',
      '[c][NX3H0]([CH3])[CH3]'
  ]
  ```

  This ensures that any aromatic ring with EDGs, regardless of their position, is captured by the rule.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Enhance Rule 6 Electron-Withdrawing Groups**

  The current patterns for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) in **Rule 6** are:

  ```python
  ewg_on_aromatic = [
      '[c][CX3](=O)[#6]',
      '[c][CX2]#N',
      '[c][SX4](=O)(=O)[#6]',
      '[c][NX3](=O)=O',
      '[c][F,Cl,Br,I]'
  ]
  ```

  These patterns may miss some common EWGs attached to aromatic rings.

  **Improvement**:

  Include additional patterns to capture other EWGs such as trifluoromethyl, aldehyde groups, and sulfonyl groups:

  ```python
  ewg_on_aromatic = [
      '[c][CX3](=O)[#6]',       # Ketone
      '[c][CX3H](=O)',          # Aldehyde
      '[c][CX2]#N',             # Nitrile
      '[c][SX4](=O)(=O)[#6]',   # Sulfone
      '[c][NX3](=O)=O',         # Nitro group
      '[c][F,Cl,Br,I]',         # Halogens
      '[c][CX4](F)(F)F'         # Trifluoromethyl
  ]
  ```

  Ensure that the patterns are general enough to match EWGs in various positions on the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Refine Rule 9 Pattern for Hydrophobic Aromatic Side Chains**

  For **Rule 9**, the pattern is:

  ```python
  aromatic_amino_acid = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX4][c]'
  ```

  This pattern may not match amino acids like phenylalanine accurately because it assumes a specific chain length and arrangement.

  **Improvement**:

  Modify the pattern to allow for variable chain lengths and branching between the amino group and the aromatic ring:

  ```python
  aromatic_amino_acid = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX4][CX4][c]'
  ```

  Or more generally:

  ```python
  aromatic_amino_acid = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX4]{1,3}[c]'
  ```

  This pattern allows for one to three aliphatic carbons between the amino group and the aromatic ring, capturing amino acids like phenylalanine and tryptophan.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Adjust Rule 10 Pattern for Distant Amino Groups**

  The current pattern for **Rule 10** is:

  ```python
  distant_amino_group = '[NX3;H2,H1][CH2]{3,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  This pattern only matches amino groups that are exactly three or more carbons away from the carboxylic acid group, which may miss molecules where the amino group is further away.

  **Improvement**:

  Adjust the pattern to include amino groups located any distance over a minimum number of carbons away from the carboxylic acid group:

  ```python
  distant_amino_group = '[NX3;H2,H1][CH2]{3,}[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  Or, to be more general:

  ```python
  distant_amino_group = '[NX3;H2,H1][CH2]{3,}@[#6]*[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  This pattern accounts for additional carbons or branching between the amino group and the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Differentiate Rule 11 Patterns for Thiol Groups**

  In **Rule 11**, the patterns are:

  ```python
  aliphatic_thiol = '[!c][SX2H]'
  aromatic_thiol = '[c][SX2H]'
  ```

  However, the pattern `[!c][SX2H]` may unintentionally match thiols attached to non-carbon atoms or exclude thiols on aliphatic carbons connected to aromatic rings.

  **Improvement**:

  Refine the aliphatic thiol pattern to specifically match thiol groups attached to sp³-hybridized carbons (aliphatic carbons):

  ```python
  aliphatic_thiol = '[CX4][SX2H]'
  ```

  And ensure that aromatic thiols are correctly identified:

  ```python
  aromatic_thiol = '[c][SX2H]'
  ```

  This ensures that thiol groups on aliphatic carbons are distinguished from those on aromatic carbons.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Include Additional Functional Groups in Rule 15**

  The current pattern for **Rule 15** is:

  ```python
  methoxy_on_aromatic = '[c][OX2][CH3]'
  ```

  This pattern matches methoxy groups on aromatic rings but doesn't account for the requirement that there are additional functional groups present.

  **Improvement**:

  Modify the pattern to ensure that the methoxy group is on an aromatic ring that also contains another functional group:

  ```python
  methoxy_on_aromatic_with_func = '[c]([OX2][CH3])[c,$(c[*!H])]'
  ```

  Alternatively, create a pattern that checks for at least one additional functional group on the aromatic ring:

  ```python
  methoxy_on_aromatic = '[c]([OX2][CH3])[c]([#6])[c][c][c][*$([OX2H]),$([NX3;H2,H1]),$([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])]'
  ```

  This ensures that only aromatic rings with methoxy groups and additional specified functional groups are matched.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

After reviewing the current rule metrics in comparison to the previous metrics, we can provide the following detailed analysis, focusing on **confidence** and **lift**, as requested.

---

### **1. Comparison of Metrics**

**Previous Rule Metrics (Average Values):**

- **Train Support**: (0.1667 + 0.1845) / 2 ≈ **0.1756**
- **Train Confidence**: (0.6352 + 0.5396) / 2 ≈ **0.5874**
- **Train Lift**: (1.2048 + 1.0559) / 2 ≈ **1.1304**
- **Train Leverage**: (0.0289 - 0.0041) / 2 ≈ **0.0124**

**Current Rule Metrics:**

- **Train Support**: **0.0229**
- **Train Confidence**: **0.7333**
- **Train Lift**: **1.4656**
- **Train Leverage**: **0.0104**

---

### **2. Interpretation of Metrics**

**a. Support**

- **Definition**: Indicates the proportion of records where both the rule conditions and predictions are true.
- **Analysis**:
  - **Decrease**: Current support is **0.0229**, significantly lower than the previous average of **0.1756**.
  - **Implication**: The current rules apply to roughly **2.29%** of the training data, whereas previous rules applied to about **17.56%**. This suggests the rules are now much more specific, covering a smaller subset of data.

**b. Confidence**

- **Definition**: The proportion of records that meet the rule conditions where the predictions are also true.
- **Analysis**:
  - **Increase**: Current confidence is **0.7333**, higher than the previous average of **0.5874**.
  - **Implication**: When the rule conditions are met, there is a **73.33%** chance that the prediction (e.g., high yield) is correct. This indicates an improvement in the reliability of the rules when they do apply.

**c. Lift**

- **Definition**: The ratio of the rule's confidence to the prior probability of the prediction.
- **Analysis**:
  - **Increase**: Current lift is **1.4656**, compared to the previous average of **1.1304**.
  - **Implication**: Lift greater than **1** indicates that the presence of the rule conditions increases the likelihood of the prediction. A higher lift suggests that the rules are more effective at identifying cases with high yield than previous rules.

**d. Leverage**

- **Definition**: The difference between the observed support and the expected support if the items were independent.
- **Analysis**:
  - **Slight Decrease**: Current leverage is **0.0104**, slightly lower than the previous average of **0.0124**.
  - **Implication**: Positive leverage indicates a stronger association than expected by chance. The decrease, along with the low support, may limit the practical significance despite improved confidence and lift.

---

### **3. Insights and Implications**

**a. Trade-off Between Specificity and Coverage**

- **High Confidence and Lift, Low Support**: The current rules are more accurate when they apply but apply less frequently.
- **Implication**: The increased confidence and lift come at the expense of covering fewer cases. The rules are highly specific and may miss broader patterns in the data.

**b. Potential Overfitting**

- **Concern**: The rules might be too tailored to the training data, capturing noise rather than generalizable patterns.
- **Evidence**: High performance on training data with low support and no test metrics provided.

**c. Lack of Test Metrics**

- **Issue**: Without test (validation) metrics, it's difficult to assess if the rules generalize well to unseen data.
- **Recommendation**: Evaluate the rules on a test dataset to check for overfitting.

---

### **4. Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

**a. Increase Support While Maintaining Confidence and Lift**

- **Broaden Rule Conditions**:
  - **Action**: Review the rules to identify overly restrictive conditions that can be relaxed.
  - **Example**: Generalize specific functional groups or positions that may not significantly impact yield.

- **Combine Similar Rules**:
  - **Action**: Merge rules that have similar rationales but apply to different subsets of data.
  - **Benefit**: Increases support by covering more instances without diluting the predictive power significantly.

**b. Validate Rules on Test Data**

- **Action**: Apply the current rules to a separate test dataset.
- **Benefit**: Ensure that high confidence and lift are not due to overfitting and that the rules perform well on new data.

**c. Balance Precision and Generality**

- **Adjust Rule Specificity**:
  - **Action**: Find an optimal balance where rules are neither too general (low confidence) nor too specific (low support).
  - **Method**: Incrementally adjust thresholds or condition parameters and monitor changes in metrics.

**d. Analyze Low-Support Areas**

- **Identify Underrepresented Patterns**:
  - **Action**: Investigate why certain data points are excluded.
  - **Benefit**: Uncover potentially overlooked factors that could enhance rule coverage.

**e. Incorporate Additional Features**

- **Expand Feature Set**:
  - **Action**: Include other relevant chemical properties or descriptors that may influence yield.
  - **Benefit**: New features may help in creating rules that are both broad and predictive.

**f. Iterative Refinement**

- **Cycle of Improvement**:
  - **Action**: Reiterate the process of rule generation and evaluation, incorporating feedback from each iteration.
  - **Benefit**: Gradually improves the model's performance and generalizability.

---

### **5. Conclusion**

The current rules have improved in terms of confidence and lift, indicating better predictive accuracy when the rules are applied. However, the significant reduction in support suggests that these rules apply to a small fraction of the data, which limits their overall utility.

To enhance the performance of the rules:

- **Increase support** by making the rules less restrictive without severely compromising confidence and lift.
- **Evaluate on test data** to ensure that the improvements are not due to overfitting.
- **Iteratively refine** the rules, balancing the trade-off between specificity and generality.

By focusing on these areas, we can develop a set of rules that not only predict high yield with high confidence but also apply to a larger portion of the dataset, making them more valuable for practical applications in the catalytic problem.

---

**Next Steps**:

- **Gather Test Metrics**: Apply the current rules to the test dataset and compute support, confidence, lift, and leverage.
- **Adjust Rules Based on Findings**: Use insights from test performance to adjust the rules accordingly.
- **Collaborative Review**: Discuss potential changes with the research team to incorporate diverse expertise in refining the rules.

ML Commenter Message:
**1. Comments on Accuracies:**

The current 5-fold validation accuracy obtained is **57.14%**, which is significantly lower than the previous validation accuracies that ranged between **68%** to **76%**, with test accuracies of **62.5%** to **75%**. This notable decrease in validation accuracy indicates that the current set of rules is less effective in predicting the experimental outcomes compared to previous iterations.

**2. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

Given the substantial drop in both validation and test accuracies, the model appears to be **underfitting**. The current rules may not be capturing the essential features and patterns necessary to accurately predict the modifier loading on the catalyst. This suggests that the rules are either too general or missing critical factors influencing the catalytic behavior.

**3. Analysis Based on SHAP Values:**

To pinpoint the rules contributing to mispredictions, we analyze the SHAP values for molecules where there is a discrepancy between the predicted and experimental values. Specifically, we focus on:

- **Molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high** (underestimated loadings).
- **Molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low** (overestimated loadings).

**a. Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

For these molecules, we look for rules with the most negative SHAP values for high loading, as they contribute most to the low prediction.

1. **Molecule:** C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O
   - **Rules with Significant Negative SHAP Values:**
     - **Rule 1:** -0.0206
     - **Rule 2:** -0.0207
     - **Rule 15:** -0.0206
   - **Observation:** Rules 1, 2, and 15 contribute negatively, leading to an underestimation.

2. **Molecule:** C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O
   - **Rules with Significant Negative SHAP Values:**
     - **Rule 1:** -0.0206
     - **Rule 2:** -0.0207
     - **Rule 15:** -0.0206

3. **Molecule:** C1=CN=CC=C1CCCC(=O)O
   - **Rules with Significant Negative SHAP Values:**
     - **Rule 1:** -0.0206
     - **Rule 2:** -0.0207
     - **Rule 15:** -0.0206

**b. Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

For these molecules, we look for rules with the most positive SHAP values for high loading, as they contribute most to the high prediction.

1. **Molecule:** CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O
   - **Rules with Significant Positive SHAP Values:**
     - **Rule 7:** 0.0205
     - **Rule 8:** 0.0398
     - **Rule 12:** 0.0205

2. **Molecule:** C(COCCOCCN)C(=O)O
   - **Rules with Significant Positive SHAP Values:**
     - **Rule 8:** 0.0398
     - **Rule 12:** 0.0205

3. **Molecule:** CC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
   - **Rules with Significant Positive SHAP Values:**
     - **Rule 8:** 0.0398
     - **Rule 12:** 0.0205

**4. Interpretation of SHAP Analysis and Rule Effectiveness:**

From the SHAP analysis:

- **Rule 1** and **Rule 2** consistently have negative SHAP values in cases where we underestimate the loading, suggesting these rules may be overly penalizing certain modifiers.
- **Rule 15** also contributes negatively in these cases, indicating it may need refinement.
- **Rule 8** shows positive SHAP values contributing to overestimation in molecules where the experimental value is low, suggesting it may be overemphasizing certain features.

**5. Recommendations for Improvement:**

Based on the analysis, the following adjustments and considerations are recommended:

**Refine Rules Associated with Underestimated Loadings:**

- **Rule 1 (Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains yield high value):**
  - **Issue:** Negative SHAP values for molecules where the experimental value is high but predicted low indicate the rule may be too restrictive or not capturing all relevant modifiers.
  - **Improvement:** Expand the rule to include modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acid groups, as these may also enhance metal coordination similarly to acidic amino acids.
  - **Action:** Modify Rule 1 to include polyhydroxyl carboxylic acids (e.g., ascorbic acid).

- **Rule 2 (Modifiers with an amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring yield high value):**
  - **Issue:** Negative SHAP values suggest this rule may be excluding modifiers that should yield high value.
  - **Improvement:** Broaden the rule to include modifiers with amino groups on aliphatic chains near aromatic rings or carboxyl groups.
  - **Action:** Adjust Rule 2 to encompass amino groups within one or two bonds of an aromatic ring or carboxyl group.

- **Rule 15 (Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value when combined with additional functional groups):**
  - **Issue:** Negative SHAP values imply this rule may be misclassifying certain modifiers.
  - **Improvement:** Clarify the additional functional groups required for the rule to apply, ensuring it captures relevant modifiers without over-penalizing others.
  - **Action:** Specify that Rule 15 applies when methoxy groups are present alongside electron-donating groups like amino or hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring.

**Adjust Rules Associated with Overestimated Loadings:**

- **Rule 8 (Modifiers containing multiple fluorine atoms or perfluorinated chains yield low value):**
  - **Issue:** Positive SHAP values in overestimated cases indicate the rule may be overemphasizing certain features, leading to high predicted loadings for low-value modifiers.
  - **Improvement:** Re-evaluate the impact of fluorinated groups on catalyst interaction, considering that not all fluorinated compounds may negatively affect the outcome.
  - **Action:** Refine Rule 8 to focus on perfluorinated chains longer than a specific length or with a high degree of fluorination, which are more likely to disrupt catalyst interactions.

**General Recommendations to Improve Model Performance:**

- **Introduce New Rules or Features:**
  - Incorporate rules that account for modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, as they may enhance catalyst interactions.
  - Consider the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity balance of the modifiers, as it can influence catalyst interaction and should be captured in the feature matrix.

- **Enhance Rule Specificity:**
  - Avoid overly general rules that may not accurately predict modifier behavior.
  - Include structural considerations such as the position of functional groups, steric hindrance, and resonance effects.

- **Address Overfitting/Underfitting:**
  - Increase the complexity of the rules carefully to avoid overfitting.
  - Ensure that the rules are general enough to apply to unseen data but specific enough to capture key features.

- **Iterative Evaluation and Refinement:**
  - Use the SHAP analysis iteratively to fine-tune the rules.
  - After modifying the rules, re-evaluate the model's performance to assess improvements.

**6. Conclusion:**

The current set of rules appears to be underfitting the data, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy and insights from the SHAP analysis. By refining rules that contribute most significantly to mispredictions—specifically Rules 1, 2, 8, and 15—we can improve the model's ability to accurately predict modifier loading on the catalyst. Incorporating these recommendations should enhance the generalization of the rules and lead to better alignment between predicted and experimental values.

**Summary and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

**1. Summary of Discussions:**

In the recent analysis of the catalytic reaction involving Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe) and various molecular modifiers, several observations and suggestions were made to improve the current set of rules predicting the modifier's impact on yield.

**Rule Metric Analysis:**

- **Current Metrics:**
  - **Train Support:** Significantly lower at **2.29%** compared to previous averages (~17.56%), indicating that the rules apply to a small portion of the dataset.
  - **Train Confidence:** Higher at **73.33%** versus previous averages (~58.74%), suggesting increased reliability when the rules are applicable.
  - **Train Lift:** Improved to **1.4656** from previous averages (~1.1304), indicating better predictive power of the rules.
- **Interpretation:** While the current rules are more accurate when they apply, the low support suggests they are too specific, potentially missing broader patterns and contributing to underfitting.

**Accuracy and SHAP Analysis:**

- **Validation Accuracy:** Decreased to **57.14%**, significantly lower than previous accuracies ranging from 68% to 76%. This suggests that the model is underfitting and not capturing essential features needed for accurate predictions.
- **SHAP Analysis:**
  - **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):** Negative SHAP values from **Rules 1, 2, and 15** contribute to underestimations.
  - **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):** Positive SHAP values from **Rule 8** contribute to overestimations.
- **Implication:** Certain rules may be too restrictive or not accurately capturing the modifiers' effects on catalyst performance, leading to mispredictions.

**2. Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

To enhance the performance of the rules without overfitting, the following suggestions are proposed:

**a. Refine Rule SMARTS Patterns:**

- **Rule 1 (Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains):**
  - **Issue:** Negative SHAP values indicate the rule may be too narrow.
  - **Improvement:** Expand to include **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** that can enhance metal coordination similar to acidic amino acids.
  - **Action:** Adjust the SMARTS pattern to include modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near carboxylic acid groups.

- **Rule 2 (Modifiers with an amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring):**
  - **Issue:** May exclude modifiers where amino groups are near but not directly attached to aromatic rings.
  - **Improvement:** Broaden the rule to include modifiers with amino groups within **one or two bonds** of an aromatic ring or carboxyl group.
  - **Action:** Modify the SMARTS pattern to capture adjacent amino groups.

- **Rule 3 (Modifiers containing a pyridine ring directly attached to the carboxyl group):**
  - **Issue:** The existing pattern is too specific to certain positions on the pyridine ring.
  - **Improvement:** Generalize the pattern to match any pyridine carboxylic acid, regardless of the position of the carboxyl group.
  - **Action:** Use a more flexible SMARTS pattern such as `'[n]1ccccc1C(=O)[O;H,-]'`.

- **Rule 4 (Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids):**
  - **Issue:** Current pattern may not match all relevant long-chain acids.
  - **Improvement:** Correct the pattern to include any aliphatic chain with six or more carbons leading to a carboxylic acid.
  - **Action:** Adjust the SMARTS pattern to `'[*][CH2]{5,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`.

- **Rule 5 (Electron-donating groups on aromatic rings):**
  - **Issue:** Patterns may not capture all possible EDGs or their positions on the ring.
  - **Improvement:** Expand patterns to include EDGs at various positions and additional groups like alkyl groups.
  - **Action:** Incorporate more general patterns and additional EDGs such as `'[c][c][c][c][c][c][NX3;H2,H1]'`.

- **Rule 6 (Electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings):**
  - **Issue:** May miss common EWGs.
  - **Improvement:** Enhance patterns to include additional EWGs like **aldehyde**, **trifluoromethyl**, and **sulfonyl** groups.
  - **Action:** Update the EWG patterns to capture a wider range of EWGs.

- **Rule 8 (Modifiers containing multiple fluorine atoms):**
  - **Issue:** Positive SHAP values in mispredictions suggest overemphasis on certain features.
  - **Improvement:** Refine the rule to focus on **highly fluorinated chains** that negatively impact catalyst interactions.
  - **Action:** Modify the rule to specify the degree of fluorination affecting catalyst performance.

- **Rule 9 (Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains):**
  - **Issue:** Pattern may not match all relevant amino acids.
  - **Improvement:** Adjust the pattern to allow **variable chain lengths** and branching between the amino group and the aromatic ring.
  - **Action:** Use a pattern like `'[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX4]{1,3}[c]'`.

- **Rule 10 (Modifiers with amino groups located on long aliphatic chains):**
  - **Issue:** May not include all distant amino groups.
  - **Improvement:** Adjust the pattern to include amino groups any number of carbons away over a minimum threshold.
  - **Action:** Update the pattern to `'[NX3;H2,H1][CH2]{3,}@[#6]*[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`.

- **Rule 11 (Modifiers with thiol groups):**
  - **Issue:** Patterns may not accurately distinguish between aliphatic and aromatic thiols.
  - **Improvement:** Differentiate patterns to specifically match thiols attached to aliphatic or aromatic carbons.
  - **Action:** Use `'[CX4][SX2H]'` for aliphatic thiols and `'[c][SX2H]'` for aromatic thiols.

- **Rule 15 (Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings):**
  - **Issue:** May not account for required additional functional groups.
  - **Improvement:** Specify that high yield is predicted when methoxy groups are present alongside other electron-donating groups.
  - **Action:** Adjust the pattern to include additional functional groups, e.g., `'[c]([OX2][CH3])[c][*$([OX2H]),$([NX3;H2,H1]),$([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])]'`.

**b. Increase Rule Support While Maintaining Confidence and Lift:**

- **Broaden Rule Conditions:** Relax overly restrictive conditions to cover more data without significantly reducing predictive accuracy.
- **Combine Similar Rules:** Merge rules with similar rationales to increase support and simplify the rule set.

**c. Validate Rules on Test Data:**

- **Evaluate on Unseen Data:** Apply the refined rules to a test dataset to ensure they generalize well and are not overfitting to the training data.
- **Monitor Performance Metrics:** Track changes in support, confidence, lift, and accuracy to assess improvements.

**d. Balance Precision and Generality:**

- **Avoid Over-Specialization:** Ensure that rules are not so specific that they only apply to a few molecules.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Continuously adjust and test rules to find an optimal balance that maximizes predictive power and applicability.

**3. Possibility for Further Optimization:**

There is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the SMARTS patterns and adjusting the rules as suggested, we can improve both the coverage of the rules (support) and the predictive accuracy (confidence and lift). This should help address the underfitting indicated by the decreased validation accuracy and improve the model's performance on both training and unseen data.

**Please Optimize Rules**

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1** to include modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid group, such as polyhydroxy carboxylic acids. Modify the SMARTS pattern to capture molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons next to the carboxyl group. For example, adjust the pattern to `'C(=O)[O;H]C([O;H])([O;H])C([O;H])([O;H])'` to include compounds like (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Advice 2**: **Broaden Rule 2 by adjusting its SMARTS pattern** to match modifiers where amino groups are within one or two bonds of an aromatic ring or a carboxyl group, not just directly attached. Update the pattern to include adjacent amino groups, such as `'[NX3;H2,H1][CH2,CH][c]'`, capturing compounds like 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Advice 3**: **Generalize the SMARTS pattern for Rule 3** to match any pyridine carboxylic acid, regardless of the position of the carboxyl group on the pyridine ring. Use a more flexible pattern like `'n1cccc([C](=O)[O;H])c1'` to capture all isomers of pyridine carboxylic acids, such as pyridine-2-carboxylic acid and pyridine-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Advice 4**: **Correct the SMARTS pattern for Rule 4** to include any long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbons. Adjust the pattern to `'C[CH2]{4,}C(=O)[O;H]'` to represent aliphatic chains of six or more carbons ending with a carboxylic acid group, covering compounds like octanoic acid and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Advice 5**: **Expand Rule 5** to include electron-donating groups (EDGs) at various positions on the aromatic ring and additional groups like alkyl groups. Incorporate more general SMARTS patterns such as `'c1ccc([OX2H, NX3H2, CH3])cc1'` to capture modifiers with hydroxyl, amino, or methyl groups on aromatic rings.

- **Advice 6**: **Enhance the SMARTS pattern for Rule 6** to include additional electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like aldehyde, trifluoromethyl, and sulfonyl groups. Update the pattern with `'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[H,OX1], [C](F)(F)F, [SX4](=O)(=O)[O;H])cc1'` to capture compounds with aldehyde, trifluoromethyl, or sulfonic acid groups attached to aromatic rings.

- **Advice 7**: **Refine Rule 8** to focus on modifiers with highly fluorinated chains that negatively impact catalyst interactions. Modify the SMARTS pattern to specify perfluorinated chains, such as `'C[F][C;R0]'` to denote carbons bonded to multiple fluorine atoms, capturing compounds like 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Advice 8**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 9** to allow variable chain lengths and branching between the amino group and the aromatic ring. Use a pattern like `'[NX3;H2,H1][CH2,CH]{1,3}[c]'` to capture amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains, such as phenylalanine and tryptophan.

- **Advice 9**: **Modify Rule 10** to include amino groups located any number of carbons away (over a minimum threshold) from the carboxylic acid group. Update the SMARTS pattern to `'[NX3;H2,H1][CH2]{2,}[CX3](=O)[O;H]'` to match compounds like 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- **Advice 10**: **Differentiate the SMARTS patterns in Rule 11** to specifically match thiol groups attached to aliphatic carbons (yielding high value) and those attached directly to aromatic rings (yielding low value). Use `'[CX4][SX2H]'` for aliphatic thiols (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) and `'[c][SX2H]'` for aromatic thiols (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid).

- **Advice 11**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 15** to include modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings when combined with additional electron-donating groups. Use a pattern like `'c1cc([OX2][CH3])ccc1[OX2H, NX3H2]'` to capture compounds like 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Advice 12**: **Increase rule support by broadening rule conditions** where appropriate, without significantly reducing predictive accuracy. Relax overly restrictive conditions and consider merging similar rules (e.g., combining Rules 2 and 5) to cover more data and enhance applicability.

- **Advice 13**: **Validate the refined rules on test data** to ensure they generalize well and do not overfit the training data. Monitor performance metrics such as support, confidence, lift, and validation accuracy to assess improvements and adjust the rules accordingly.

- **Advice 14**: **Balance precision and generality by iterative refinement** of the SMARTS patterns and rules. Continuously test and adjust the rules to find an optimal balance that maximizes predictive power and applicability without overfitting or underfitting.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** is clear, specifying amino acids with acidic side chains containing both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups yield high value. The property insight is strong, as additional carboxylic acid groups enhance metal coordination and stabilize the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, adding complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (Glutamic acid and Aspartic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** clearly states that modifiers with an amino group at the para position on a benzoic acid ring yield high value unless additional aromatic rings are directly attached. The property insight is valid, explaining how the para-amino group enhances metal interaction, and additional rings may hinder coordination. The rule incorporates complexity by considering both functional groups and steric effects. It is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid yields high; 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yields low).

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** explicitly identifies that modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of a benzoic acid ring yield high value. The property insight is logical, as electron-withdrawing groups stabilize metal complexes. The rule's complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific substituents. It is backed by at least two data points (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid both yield high).

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** is clear in stating that modifiers containing aldehyde groups yield low value. The property insight is sound, suggesting aldehyde groups may react with catalyst components and deactivate them. The rule is straightforward yet effective, and it is supported by at least two data points (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid both yield low).

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** distinctly differentiates between thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains (yielding high value) and those attached to aromatic rings (yielding low value). The property insight is credible, with aliphatic thiols enhancing metal binding and aromatic thiols potentially poisoning the catalyst. The rule's complexity is adequate, and it is supported by data points for both high and low yields (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid yields high; 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid yields low).

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** states that perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids yield low value. While the rule is clear and the property insight is reasonable (fluorinated chains disrupt catalyst interactions), it lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one data point (e.g., nonafluoropentanoic acid yields low).

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** indicates that amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains yield low value. The clarity and property insight are acceptable, but the rule lacks complexity and sufficient coverage, with only one supporting data point (e.g., Phenylalanine yields low).

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** clearly specifies that modifiers with amino groups on long aliphatic chains (five carbons or more from the carboxyl group) yield low value. The property insight is valid, as distant amino groups are less effective in coordination. The rule considers the positional relationship between functional groups and is supported by at least two data points (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid both yield low).

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** effectively differentiates modifiers containing pyridine rings attached via an aliphatic linker (yielding high value) from those directly fused to another aromatic ring (yielding low value). The property insight regarding steric hindrance is credible. The rule is complex and is supported by data points showing both outcomes (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid yields high; 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yields low).

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** states that modifiers with ketone groups on aliphatic chains yield low value. While the rule is clear and the property insight is plausible, it lacks sufficient coverage with only one supporting data point (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid yields low).

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** suggests that modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value when combined with additional electron-donating groups. The rule is somewhat complex and the property insight is acceptable. However, it lacks adequate coverage, being supported by only one data point (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid yields high).

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** clearly states that modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high value. The property insight is strong, with nitrogen heterocycles enhancing metal coordination. The rule considers specific heterocyclic structures and is supported by at least two data points (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid and Tryptophan both yield high).

- **Comment 13**:

  **Rule 13** points out that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups yield high value. The property insight regarding improved solubility and metal coordination is reasonable. However, the rule lacks sufficient coverage, supported by only one data point (e.g., pentahydroxyhexanoic acid yields high).

- **Comment 14**:

  **Rule 14** acknowledges that modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains yield variable results and cannot be reliably predicted. The clarity and property insight reflect the variability observed. The rule considers combinations of substructures, and the coverage is appropriate, showing both high and low yields (e.g., dihydroxypropan-2-yl acetic acid yields high; methoxyethoxy acetic acid yields low).

- **Comment 15**:

  **Rule 15** states that modifiers with hydroxyl groups on an aromatic ring attached to an aliphatic chain yield variable results and cannot be reliably predicted. The rule is clear and provides property insight into how functional group positioning affects interaction. It is complex and supported by data points with differing yields (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yields high; 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yields low).

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Structural Descriptors**

  The current rules are qualitative and rely on human interpretation of molecular structures, which makes it challenging to create a numeric feature matrix directly from them. To improve this, reformulate the rules into quantifiable structural descriptors that can be systematically extracted from the SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers with amino groups located on long aliphatic chains (five carbons or more from the carboxyl group) yield low value," specify the exact positional relationships that can be numerically represented, such as the distance (number of bonds) between functional groups.

- **Advice 2**: **Develop a Standardized Set of Molecular Features**

  Create a standardized set of molecular features or fingerprints that capture the presence, counts, and positions of relevant functional groups and structural motifs. Features could include counts of specific atoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen), presence of specific functional groups (e.g., amino groups, carboxylic acids), ring systems, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and topological descriptors. Tools like RDKit can be used to compute these features from SMILES strings.

- **Advice 3**: **Implement Numeric Thresholds for Electron-Withdrawing and -Donating Effects**

  Quantify the electron-withdrawing or -donating effects of substituents using Hammett sigma constants or other electronic parameters. This allows for a numeric representation of Rule 3 ("Modifiers bearing electron-withdrawing groups... yield high value") and Rule 11 ("Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value when combined with additional electron-donating groups").

- **Advice 4**: **Encode Steric Hindrance Using Molecular Descriptors**

  Incorporate steric descriptors such as molecular volume, surface area, and steric parameters like Taft's steric constants. This addresses rules that mention steric effects, such as Rule 2's exception for "additional aromatic rings may sterically hinder coordination."

- **Advice 5**: **Use Molecular Topology to Represent Structural Relationships**

  Utilize topological indices and descriptors to capture the structural relationships within the molecules, such as the connectivity between functional groups. Graph-based features can represent the molecular architecture numerically, aiding in the application of rules related to molecular structure.

- **Advice 6**: **Automate Functional Group Identification**

  Implement automated algorithms to identify and count functional groups mentioned in the rules (e.g., amino acids, thiol groups, aldehydes, ketones). This removes subjective interpretation and ensures consistency in how modifiers are classified according to the rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Distance Metrics Between Functional Groups**

  Calculate the distance between key functional groups (e.g., number of atoms or bonds between an amino group and a carboxyl group). This directly addresses rules concerning the positional effects of functional groups, such as Rule 8.

- **Advice 8**: **Categorize Modifiers Based on Molecular Substructures**

  Group modifiers into categories based on shared substructures (e.g., aromatic amino acids, aliphatic acids with hydroxyl groups). This helps in applying rules that are dependent on specific molecular frameworks and simplifies feature generation.

- **Advice 9**: **Quantify Hydrophobicity Using LogP Values**

  Calculate LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient) values to quantify hydrophobicity, which relates to Rule 7 about amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains yielding low value. Numerical hydrophobicity scales can be directly used in modeling.

- **Advice 10**: **Integrate Electronic and Steric Parameters into a Feature Matrix**

  Combine all the quantified electronic, steric, and structural descriptors into a single feature matrix. This matrix can then be used for statistical modeling or machine learning to predict yields, making the rules more practically applicable.

- **Advice 11**: **Validate and Refine Rules Using Statistical Methods**

  Use statistical analysis to validate the significance of each modified rule based on the numerical features. Refine the rules by determining which descriptors have the most predictive power for high or low yield outcomes.

- **Advice 12**: **Provide Examples with Numerical Feature Representation**

  Include examples demonstrating how modifiers are represented numerically according to the new descriptors. This aids in understanding and ensures the rules are easily interpretable and applicable in computational workflows.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids containing two carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic amino acids) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both amino and two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize the metal complex by delocalizing electron density, which improves catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with an amino group at the para position yield high value if not directly connected to additional aromatic rings.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 4-aminobenzoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: The amino group enhances coordination with the metal center, but additional aromatic rings can introduce steric hindrance or alter electronic properties adversely affecting the yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on aliphatic chains yield high value; those with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic efficiency, whereas aromatic thiols may form strong, non-ideal interactions that deactivate the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value.**
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form unwanted side reactions with catalyst components, leading to deactivation and lower yields.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) yield high value.**
  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide numerous coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with amino groups located on shorter aliphatic chains (five carbons or fewer from the carboxyl group) yield high value; those with amino groups on longer chains yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group facilitates effective coordination with the metal center, while distant amino groups are less effective.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with pyridine rings connected via an aliphatic linker yield high value; those directly attached to another aromatic ring yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin).
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic linkers reduce steric hindrance and allow better flexibility for the pyridine nitrogen to coordinate with the metal, whereas direct attachment to an aromatic ring restricts this interaction.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value when combined with additional coordinating functional groups.**
  - *Example*: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing interaction with the metal center if other coordinating groups are present.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan).
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate effectively with the metal center, improving catalyst activity and stability.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups on aliphatic chains yield low value.**
  - *Example*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can chelate the metal in an unfavorable manner or compete with catalytic sites, leading to decreased activity.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids yield low value.**
  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduce the ability of the carboxylate oxygen to coordinate with the metal center, diminishing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains yield high value when multiple hydroxyl groups are also present; otherwise, they yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance metal coordination despite the presence of ether linkages, whereas ethers alone may not provide sufficient interaction.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings attached via short aliphatic chains yield high value; those with shorter chains or directly attached yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers improve flexibility and positioning of hydroxyl groups for effective metal coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (six carbons or more) without interfering functional groups yield high value.**
  - *Example*: Octanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate accessibility to the catalyst and improve overall reaction efficiency.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids containing two carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic amino acids) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both amino and two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize the metal complex by delocalizing electron density, which improves catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with an amino group at the para position yield high value if not directly connected to additional aromatic rings.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 4-aminobenzoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: The amino group enhances coordination with the metal center, but additional aromatic rings can introduce steric hindrance or alter electronic properties adversely affecting the yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on aliphatic chains yield high value; those with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic efficiency, whereas aromatic thiols may form strong, non-ideal interactions that deactivate the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value.**
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form unwanted side reactions with catalyst components, leading to deactivation and lower yields.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) yield high value.**
  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide numerous coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with amino groups located on shorter aliphatic chains (five carbons or fewer from the carboxyl group) yield high value; those with amino groups on longer chains yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group facilitates effective coordination with the metal center, while distant amino groups are less effective.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with pyridine rings connected via an aliphatic linker yield high value; those directly attached to another aromatic ring yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin).
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic linkers reduce steric hindrance and allow better flexibility for the pyridine nitrogen to coordinate with the metal, whereas direct attachment to an aromatic ring restricts this interaction.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value when combined with additional coordinating functional groups.**
  - *Example*: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing interaction with the metal center if other coordinating groups are present.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan).
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate effectively with the metal center, improving catalyst activity and stability.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups on aliphatic chains yield low value.**
  - *Example*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can chelate the metal in an unfavorable manner or compete with catalytic sites, leading to decreased activity.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids yield low value.**
  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduce the ability of the carboxylate oxygen to coordinate with the metal center, diminishing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains yield high value when multiple hydroxyl groups are also present; otherwise, they yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance metal coordination despite the presence of ether linkages, whereas ethers alone may not provide sufficient interaction.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings attached via short aliphatic chains yield high value; those with shorter chains or directly attached yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers improve flexibility and positioning of hydroxyl groups for effective metal coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (six carbons or more) without interfering functional groups yield high value.**
  - *Example*: Octanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate accessibility to the catalyst and improve overall reaction efficiency.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: Correct the 'thiol_aliphatic' SMARTS pattern in the 'patterns' dictionary. The current pattern `'[SX2H][!#6]'` incorrectly matches thiols attached to non-carbon atoms. It should be changed to `'[SX2H][CX4]'` to match aliphatic thiols where the thiol group is attached to a saturated carbon atom, aligning with Rule 4's requirements.

- **Suggestion 2**: Modify the code to add explicit hydrogens to the molecules before substructure matching. Many SMARTS patterns rely on the presence of explicit hydrogens (e.g., `'[NX3H2]'`, `'[OX2H]'`), and RDKit's default molecule objects may not include them. Insert `mol = Chem.AddHs(mol)` after molecule creation to ensure accurate matching.

- **Suggestion 3**: Review and adjust the 'long_aliphatic_chain' SMARTS pattern. The current pattern `'[CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2]'` is too restrictive, only matching chains of exactly five methylene groups with two hydrogens each. Replace it with a more flexible pattern like `'CCCCCC'` or use `'[CH2]'` repeated six or more times to match any long aliphatic chain of six or more carbons, as intended in Rule 15.

- **Suggestion 4**: Refine the 'amino_group_short_chain' and 'amino_group_long_chain' SMARTS patterns to correctly represent chain lengths specified in Rule 7. For 'amino_group_short_chain', use a pattern that matches chains with five or fewer carbons between the amino group and carboxyl group. Similarly, adjust 'amino_group_long_chain' to match chains longer than five carbons. For example:
  - 'amino_group_short_chain': `'[NX3H2][$([CX4][$([CX4][$([CX4][$([CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H])])])])]'`
  - 'amino_group_long_chain': `'[NX3H2][$([CX4][$([CX4][$([CX4][$([CX4][$([CX4][$([CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H])])])])])])]'`

- **Suggestion 5**: Ensure the 'conditions' are properly implemented in the code. For instance, in Rule 6, the condition `'number_of_hydroxyl_groups': 3` might not be accurately checked. Modify the condition check to count the occurrences of the hydroxyl group pattern and compare it with the threshold:
  ```python
  matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(condition_pat)
  if len(matches) < threshold:
      conditions_met = False
  ```

- **Suggestion 6**: Update the 'perfluorinated_chain' SMARTS pattern to accurately match perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids as described in Rule 12. The current pattern `'[CX4]([F])([F])([F])'` only matches a carbon with three fluorines. Use a recursive SMARTS pattern to match longer perfluorinated chains, such as `'[CX4]([F])([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[F]'` or consider using the fluorine count in conditions.

- **Suggestion 7**: Modify the 'hydroxyl_on_aromatic_chain' SMARTS pattern to include chain length considerations for Rule 14. Since the rule differentiates based on chain length, incorporate the chain length into the pattern:
  - For the high-value condition (longer chains): `'[c][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][OX2H]'`
  - For the low-value condition (shorter chains or direct attachment): `'[c][CX4][CX4][OX2H]'`

- **Suggestion 8**: Adjust the 'benzoic_acid_with_para_EWG' SMARTS pattern in the 'patterns' dictionary. The current pattern may not accurately capture benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. A more precise pattern could be:
  `'[c]1[c][c][c]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[c][c]1[A;$([F,Cl,Br,I]),$([NX3](=O)[OX1-])]` where `[A]` represents the EWG at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 9**: Ensure consistency and clarity in pattern naming within the 'patterns' dictionary to avoid confusion. For example, standardize the naming of 'thiol_aromatic' and 'aromatic_thiol' to a single term.

- **Suggestion 10**: Enhance the 'exclude' logic in the code to prevent rules from incorrectly matching when exclusion criteria are present. Make sure that if any exclude pattern matches, the rule is disqualified, even if all other patterns match.

- **Suggestion 11**: Provide detailed documentation or comments within the code explaining the purpose and structure of each SMARTS pattern. This aids in verification and future maintenance of the code.

- **Suggestion 12**: Utilize RDKit's built-in functionalities and fragment libraries where possible. This can improve the accuracy of SMARTS patterns and reduce the likelihood of errors in pattern definitions.

- **Suggestion 13**: Sanitize molecules using `Chem.SanitizeMol(mol)` before performing substructure searches to ensure that the molecule is in a consistent and valid state for matching.

- **Suggestion 14**: Implement unit tests for each SMARTS pattern against known compounds to verify that the patterns match the intended structures. This approach can help identify mismatches and correct patterns accordingly.

- **Suggestion 15**: Review and correct the logic for handling multiple entries of the same rule number (e.g., Rule 4 and Rule 4 for high and low values). Consider renaming them distinctly (e.g., Rule 4a and Rule 4b) to avoid confusion and ensure proper indexing in the feature matrix.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Metrics:**

Upon reviewing the current rule metrics and comparing them with the reference metrics from previous iterations, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current rules, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**.

1. **Train Support: 0.0**

   - **Interpretation:** A train support of 0.0 indicates that none of the rules are matching any instances in the training data. This means that the conditions specified in the rules are not present in the dataset, or they are too specific.

   - **Comparison with Previous Metrics:** Previously, the train support values ranged from approximately 0.1667 to 0.1845, indicating that the rules were applicable to about 16.7% to 18.5% of the training data. The current drop to 0.0 suggests a significant reduction in rule applicability.

2. **Train Confidence: 0.5**

   - **Interpretation:** A train confidence of 0.5 means that when the rule conditions are met (which, in this case, is never due to 0 support), the prediction is correct half the time. However, since support is 0, this confidence value may not be meaningful.

   - **Comparison with Previous Metrics:** Previously, train confidence values were higher, around 0.5396 to 0.6352, indicating better predictive accuracy when the rule conditions were met.

3. **Train Lift: 1.0**

   - **Interpretation:** A lift of 1.0 suggests that the rule does not provide any advantage over random chance. Essentially, the presence of the rule conditions does not affect the likelihood of the prediction.

   - **Comparison with Previous Metrics:** Prior lift values were greater than 1.0 (approximately 1.0559 to 1.4656), signifying that the rules had some predictive power and were more informative than random guessing.

4. **Train Leverage: 0.0**

   - **Interpretation:** A leverage of 0.0 indicates that there is no difference between the observed support and the expected support if the rule conditions and predictions were independent. This further confirms that the rules are not contributing to predictive capabilities.

   - **Comparison with Previous Metrics:** Previous leverage values ranged from -0.0041 to 0.0289, showing slight positive associations in earlier rules.

**Assessment of Current Rules:**

Given the metrics, it is clear that the current set of rules is underperforming compared to previous iterations. The zero support and leverage, along with a lift of 1.0, indicate that the rules are neither finding matches in the data nor contributing to improved predictive accuracy. The confidence level, while at 0.5, is not meaningful in this context due to the lack of support.

**Possible Reasons for Poor Performance:**

- **Over-Specificity of Rules:** The rules may be too narrowly defined, causing them to exclude all instances in the dataset.

- **Irrelevant Conditions:** The conditions in the rules might not be aligned with the key features that influence the outcome, leading to ineffective predictions.

- **Data Drift:** Changes in the dataset between iterations could have rendered the current rules obsolete if they were based on patterns no longer present.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Review and Revise Rule Conditions:**

   - **Expand Conditions:** Broaden the rule conditions to increase support. This might involve generalizing specific functional groups or molecular structures to encompass a wider range of modifiers.

   - **Focus on High-Impact Features:** Re-evaluate the features or molecular descriptors that have the most significant impact on the catalytic performance, and adjust the rules accordingly.

2. **Analyze Low Support Rules:**

   - Identify rules with low or zero support and assess whether they are necessary. If they are meant to capture rare but important cases, consider whether these cases are present in the data or if they should be.

3. **Incorporate Statistical Techniques:**

   - Use statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations in the data that may not be immediately apparent, and update the rules to reflect these findings.

4. **Reassess Rule Interactions:**

   - Consider whether the combination of rules leads to contradictory conditions or unintended exclusions. Ensure that the rules are not negatively impacting each other.

5. **Increase Iteration Diversity:**

   - Introduce new hypotheses or rule sets that explore different aspects of the modifiers, such as steric factors, electronic effects, or solvent interactions, to discover more effective rules.

**Determining Local Minimum and Iterations:**

- **Local Minimum:** The current stagnation in metrics suggests that a local minimum may have been reached. The lack of improvement indicates that continuing with the current approach may not yield better results.

- **Iteration Sufficiency:** Given that the performance has not improved and has, in fact, decreased, it may be time to consider a significant change in strategy rather than further iterations of the current rules.

**Next Steps:**

- **Data Exploration:** Conduct a thorough analysis of the dataset to identify new patterns or trends that can inform the development of more effective rules.

- **Collaborative Review:** Engage with other team members or experts to gain fresh perspectives and ideas for rule refinement.

- **Validation with Test Data:** Once new rules are developed, validate them using both training and test datasets to ensure they generalize well and do not suffer from overfitting.

**Conclusion:**

The current rules are not performing satisfactorily based on the metrics, particularly the zero support and lift of 1.0. To enhance the rules' effectiveness, it is essential to revisit and revise them by broadening their conditions, focusing on impactful features, and possibly adopting new analytical methods. Collaborating with peers and re-examining the data can provide insights that lead to the development of more robust and predictive rules, moving beyond the current local minimum.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Analysis of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results and comparing them with previous metrics, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current rules in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

---

**1. Evaluation of Effectiveness**

**Decrease in Accuracy:**

- **Previous Validation Accuracies:**
  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625

- **Current Validation Accuracy:**
  - An accuracy of **0.514** was obtained using the classification model.

**Interpretation:**

- The validation accuracy has decreased significantly from approximately **0.76** to **0.514**.
- This decline indicates that the current rules are **less effective** in predicting the correct loading compared to previous iterations.

---

**2. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

**Underfitting Indicated:**

- The substantial drop in validation accuracy suggests that the model may be **underfitting**.
- Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.

**Possible Causes:**

- Simplification or reduction of the rules may have led to the loss of critical predictive features.
- The model might not be leveraging the available features effectively.

---

**3. Analysis of SHAP Values and Discrepancies**

**Previous SHAP Analysis:**

- **Multiple Rules Contributed:**
  - In earlier iterations, SHAP values were reported for multiple rules (e.g., Rule1, Rule2, Rule7, Rule8, Rule11, Rule12, Rule15).
- **Varied SHAP Values:**
  - SHAP values varied across different molecules, indicating diverse contributions from different rules.

**Current SHAP Analysis:**

- **Uniformly Zero SHAP Values:**
  - All SHAP values are **0.0** for **Rule20** across all molecules.
- **No Contribution from Other Rules:**
  - SHAP analysis does not report contributions from **Rules 1 to 15**.

**Interpretation:**

- The absence of SHAP values for the defined rules suggests that they are **not contributing** to the model's predictions.
- The model might be improperly configured, or critical features are missing.
- The predictions are uniformly **'low'** across all molecules, regardless of the experimental value.

---

**4. Discrepancies in Predictions:**

**Overestimated Loadings:**

- **None Reported:**
  - There are no cases where the predicted loading is **high** while the experimental value is **low**.

**Underestimated Loadings:**

- **Multiple Cases:**
  - Several molecules have a **predicted loading of low** while the **experimental value is high**.
  - Examples include:
    - *C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
    - *C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O*
    - *C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O*
    - Others as listed in the SHAP analysis.

**Implication:**

- The model is **under-predicting** the loading for molecules that experimentally have a high value.
- This consistent under-prediction further suggests **underfitting**.

---

**5. Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

- The drop in accuracy from approximately **76% to 51%** signifies a deterioration in the model's predictive capability.
- The current rules are not capturing the necessary features to distinguish between high and low loadings effectively.
- The model might be stuck at a **local minimum**, unable to improve predictions with the current feature set.

---

**6. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Lack of Differentiation:**
  - With SHAP values being zero, the model lacks differentiation between features influencing the predictions.
- **Feature Importance Issues:**
  - The absence of feature contributions indicates potential issues with feature extraction or rule encoding.
- **Rule20 Placeholder:**
  - The reference to **Rule20** in SHAP analysis, which is not defined in the current rules, suggests a possible misconfiguration.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Re-evaluate Rule Implementation**

- **Verify Rule Encoding:**
  - Ensure that all rules (**Rules 1 to 15**) are correctly implemented and encoded in the feature matrix.
- **Investigate Rule20 Reference:**
  - **Rule20** appears in SHAP analysis but is not defined. Confirm whether this is a placeholder or an error.

**2. Enhance Feature Extraction**

- **Include All Relevant Features:**
  - Reintroduce features from the previous model that contributed to higher accuracy.
- **Balance Feature Complexity:**
  - Avoid oversimplifying the rules to prevent underfitting, but also prevent overcomplicating them to avoid overfitting.

**3. Refine Specific Rules Based on Previous SHAP Values**

- **Adjust Rules with Negative SHAP Values:**
  - Focus on rules that previously had high negative SHAP values in underestimated loadings.
  - **Example:** *Rule2* and *Rule1* often had negative SHAP values when the model underestimated the loading.
- **Modify Rules with Limited Contribution:**
  - Rules that consistently contributed little (low SHAP values) might be reconsidered or combined.

**4. Incorporate Additional Rules**

- **Expand Rule Set:**
  - Introduce new rules that capture overlooked chemical features influencing catalyst loading.
- **Consider Substituent Effects:**
  - Account for electronic and steric effects of various substituents more comprehensively.

**5. Utilize Domain Knowledge**

- **Consult Chemical Expertise:**
  - Collaborate with chemists to understand why certain modifiers yield high or low loading experimentally.
- **Revise Rationale Behind Rules:**
  - Update the rationale of existing rules based on new insights or experimental data.

**6. Improve Model Configuration**

- **Model Parameters Tuning:**
  - Adjust model parameters to improve learning from the available data.
- **Cross-Validation Strategies:**
  - Employ different cross-validation techniques to ensure the model generalizes well.

**7. Address Data Imbalance**

- **Check for Class Imbalance:**
  - Ensure that the dataset has a balanced representation of high and low loading instances.
- **Apply Resampling Techniques:**
  - Use oversampling or undersampling methods if necessary to balance the dataset.

**8. Validate Rule Effectiveness Iteratively**

- **Iterative Testing:**
  - After refining rules, iteratively test the model and analyze SHAP values to assess improvements.
- **Monitor SHAP Contributions:**
  - Ensure that SHAP values reflect meaningful contributions from the rules.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules are not performing effectively, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy and lack of meaningful SHAP values. The model appears to be underfitting, failing to capture the relationships between molecular features and catalyst loading.

To improve the model:

- **Reassess and properly implement the existing rules.**
- **Enhance the feature matrix with comprehensive and relevant features.**
- **Adjust and refine specific rules that previously contributed to inaccurate predictions.**
- **Incorporate domain knowledge to inform rule development.**
- **Iteratively validate and refine the model based on performance metrics and SHAP analysis.**

By implementing these recommendations, the model's predictive performance should improve, leading to more accurate predictions of catalyst loading based on molecular features.

**Summary and Directions for Optimizing the Current Rules**

Based on the discussions and analysis of the current rule metrics and model performance, it is evident that the current set of rules is underperforming. The significant decrease in training support, confidence, lift, and overall accuracy indicates that the rules are neither matching the data effectively nor contributing to accurate predictions.

**Key Issues Identified:**

1. **Zero Train Support and Lift of 1.0**: The rules are not matching any instances in the training data, rendering them ineffective for prediction.

2. **Decrease in Validation Accuracy**: The validation accuracy has dropped from approximately 76% in previous iterations to around 51%, indicating that the model is underfitting and failing to capture the underlying patterns.

3. **SHAP Analysis Reveals Lack of Contribution**: The SHAP values for the rules are zero across all molecules, suggesting that the rules are not influencing the model's predictions.

4. **Potential Issues with SMARTS Patterns and Code Implementation**: There are specific issues in the SMARTS patterns used for substructure matching, as well as in code implementation, such as the need to add explicit hydrogens and adjust patterns to accurately reflect the intended chemical structures.

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Correct and Refine SMARTS Patterns**:

   - **Thiol Aliphatic Pattern**: Correct the `'thiol_aliphatic'` pattern to `'[SX2H][CX4]'` to accurately match aliphatic thiols attached to saturated carbon atoms, aligning with Rule 4's requirements.

   - **Long Aliphatic Chain Pattern**: Adjust the `'long_aliphatic_chain'` pattern to be more flexible. Instead of the restrictive `'[CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2]'`, use a more general pattern like `'[CH2]([CH2]){5,}'` to match chains of six or more methylene groups.

   - **Amino Group Patterns**:
     - For `'amino_group_short_chain'`, modify the pattern to match amino groups within five carbons of the carboxyl group. Example pattern: `'[NX3H2][CX4][$([CX4][$([CX4][$([CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H])])])]'`.
     - For `'amino_group_long_chain'`, adjust the pattern to match chains longer than five carbons between the amino group and carboxyl group.

   - **Hydroxyl on Aromatic Chain Pattern**: Incorporate chain length considerations into the pattern:
     - High-value condition (longer chains): `'[c][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][OX2H]'`.
     - Low-value condition (shorter chains or direct attachment): `'[c][CX4][CX4][OX2H]'`.

   - **Perfluorinated Chain Pattern**: Update the pattern to match longer perfluorinated chains, perhaps using recursive SMARTS or conditions based on the count of fluorine atoms attached to carbons in the chain.

2. **Add Explicit Hydrogens to Molecules Before Matching**:

   - Use `Chem.AddHs(mol)` after molecule creation to ensure that SMARTS patterns relying on explicit hydrogens (e.g., `'[NX3H2]'`, `'[OX2H]'`) function correctly.

3. **Review and Adjust Code Implementation**:

   - **Count Functional Groups Accurately**: Ensure that the code correctly counts the number of occurrences of specific functional groups, such as hydroxyl groups in Rule 6, and compares them with the thresholds.

   - **Improve Exclude Logic**: Enhance the code logic to properly exclude molecules that should not match a given rule when exclusion criteria are present. If any exclude pattern matches, the rule should not be applied.

   - **Handle Rule Indexing Correctly**: Address any confusion in rule numbering, especially when multiple conditions exist for the same rule (e.g., Rule 4a and Rule 4b), to ensure that the feature matrix reflects the rules accurately.

4. **Sanitize and Prepare Molecules for Substructure Matching**:

   - Use `Chem.SanitizeMol(mol)` before performing substructure searches to ensure that the molecule is in a consistent and valid state for matching.

5. **Provide Detailed Documentation and Commenting**:

   - Add comments and documentation within the code to clarify the purpose and structure of each SMARTS pattern and code block. This aids in verification and future maintenance.

6. **Implement Unit Tests for SMARTS Patterns**:

   - Create unit tests to verify that each SMARTS pattern matches the intended structures and does not produce false positives or negatives. Test the patterns against known compounds.

7. **Re-evaluate Rule Conditions**:

   - **Broaden Rule Conditions**: Adjust overly specific rules to increase train support. For example, relax conditions that are too strict and prevent the rule from matching any compounds.

   - **Focus on Impactful Features**: Reassess which molecular features have the most significant impact on the yield based on data analysis and domain knowledge, and adjust the rules accordingly.

8. **Incorporate Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning Insights**:

   - Use statistical methods or machine learning techniques to identify new patterns or correlations that can inform rule refinement. This can help uncover overlooked features influencing the catalytic activity.

9. **Ensure Consistent Naming and Clarity**:

   - Standardize pattern names in the `'patterns'` dictionary to avoid confusion and improve code readability. For example, choose between `'thiol_aromatic'` and `'aromatic_thiol'` and stick with one.

10. **Engage in Collaborative Review**:

    - Work with chemists and other domain experts to validate the chemical relevance of the rules and patterns, ensuring they align with known chemistry and experimental observations.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Given the identified issues and the comprehensive suggestions for improvement, there is significant potential for optimizing the current rules without overfitting. By refining the SMARTS patterns, correcting code implementation errors, and enhancing the logic, the rules can be made more effective in capturing the relevant chemical features that influence the catalytic action and yield.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids containing two carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic amino acids) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both amino and two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize the metal complex by delocalizing electron density, which improves catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with an amino group at the para position yield high value if not directly connected to additional aromatic rings.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 4-aminobenzoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: The amino group enhances coordination with the metal center, but additional aromatic rings can introduce steric hindrance or alter electronic properties adversely affecting the yield.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on aliphatic chains yield high value; those with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic efficiency, whereas aromatic thiols may form strong, non-ideal interactions that deactivate the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value.**
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form unwanted side reactions with catalyst components, leading to deactivation and lower yields.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) yield high value.**
  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide numerous coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with amino groups located on shorter aliphatic chains (five carbons or fewer from the carboxyl group) yield high value; those with amino groups on longer chains yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group facilitates effective coordination with the metal center, while distant amino groups are less effective.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with pyridine rings connected via an aliphatic linker yield high value; those directly attached to another aromatic ring yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin).
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic linkers reduce steric hindrance and allow better flexibility for the pyridine nitrogen to coordinate with the metal, whereas direct attachment to an aromatic ring restricts this interaction.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value when combined with additional coordinating functional groups.**
  - *Example*: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing interaction with the metal center if other coordinating groups are present.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan).
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate effectively with the metal center, improving catalyst activity and stability.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups on aliphatic chains yield low value.**
  - *Example*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can chelate the metal in an unfavorable manner or compete with catalytic sites, leading to decreased activity.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids yield low value.**
  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduce the ability of the carboxylate oxygen to coordinate with the metal center, diminishing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains yield high value when multiple hydroxyl groups are also present; otherwise, they yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance metal coordination despite the presence of ether linkages, whereas ethers alone may not provide sufficient interaction.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings attached via short aliphatic chains yield high value; those with shorter chains or directly attached yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers improve flexibility and positioning of hydroxyl groups for effective metal coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (six carbons or more) without interfering functional groups yield high value.**
  - *Example*: Octanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate accessibility to the catalyst and improve overall reaction efficiency.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Correct and Refine SMARTS Patterns in the Rules**

  Review and update the SMARTS patterns used in the rules to accurately match the intended functional groups and molecular features.

  - **Rule 4 (Thiol Groups):**

    - **Aliphatic Thiol Pattern:**
      - Update the pattern to `'[SX2H][CX4]'` to correctly match aliphatic thiol groups attached to saturated carbon atoms.
      - This pattern ensures that thiol groups on aliphatic chains are detected, aligning with the high-yield condition of Rule 4.

    - **Aromatic Thiol Pattern:**
      - Confirm that the pattern for aromatic thiols correctly matches thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings.
      - Example pattern: `'[c][SX2H]'` to match thiol groups bonded to aromatic carbons.

  - **Rule 7 (Amino Groups on Aliphatic Chains):**

    - **Short Chain Amino Group Pattern (High Yield):**
      - Modify the pattern to detect amino groups located within five carbons of the carboxyl group.
      - Example pattern: `'[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` to match primary amines three carbons away from a carboxylic acid.

    - **Long Chain Amino Group Pattern (Low Yield):**
      - Adjust the pattern to identify amino groups on chains longer than five carbons from the carboxyl group.
      - Use a pattern that specifies a greater number of intervening carbons.

  - **Rule 14 (Hydroxyl Groups on Aromatic Rings with Aliphatic Linkers):**

    - **High Yield Condition (Longer Chains):**
      - Create a pattern to match hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings attached via longer aliphatic chains (five carbons or more).
      - Example pattern: `'[c][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][OX2H]'`.

    - **Low Yield Condition (Shorter Chains or Direct Attachment):**
      - Adjust the pattern to match hydroxyl groups directly attached or via shorter chains (less than five carbons).
      - Example pattern: `'[c][CX4][CX4][OX2H]'`.

  - **Rule 15 (Long Aliphatic Chains):**

    - **Long Aliphatic Chain Pattern:**
      - Update the pattern to `'[CH2]([CH2]){5,}'` to match aliphatic chains with six or more methylene groups.
      - This makes the pattern more flexible and increases the likelihood of matching relevant compounds.

- **Advice 2**: **Add Explicit Hydrogens to Molecules Before Substructure Matching**

  - Before performing substructure searches, add explicit hydrogens to the molecules using `Chem.AddHs(mol)`.
  - This is crucial for patterns that involve explicit hydrogen atoms, such as `[NX3H2]` for primary amino groups or `[OX2H]` for hydroxyl groups.
  - Adding explicit hydrogens ensures accurate and reliable substructure matching.

- **Advice 3**: **Sanitize and Prepare Molecules Properly**

  - Use `Chem.SanitizeMol(mol)` after molecule creation to ensure molecules are in a valid and standardized form.
  - Sanitization corrects valence issues, standardizes bond types, and identifies aromaticity, which improves substructure matching accuracy.

- **Advice 4**: **Review and Correct Code Implementation**

  - **Functional Group Counting:**
    - Ensure that the code accurately counts the number of functional groups when required (e.g., multiple hydroxyl groups in Rule 6).
    - Adjust code logic to correctly sum occurrences and compare them against the rule's thresholds.

  - **Exclusion Criteria Implementation:**
    - Verify that exclusion patterns are correctly implemented.
    - If any exclude pattern matches, the rule should not apply to the molecule.

  - **Rule Indexing:**
    - Confirm that the indices used in the feature matrix correctly correspond to the rule numbers.
    - Consistent indexing is essential, especially when rules have multiple conditions (e.g., Rule 4a and Rule 4b).

- **Advice 5**: **Implement Unit Tests for SMARTS Patterns**

  - Develop unit tests for each SMARTS pattern to validate their correctness.
  - Create test cases with molecules that should match and not match each pattern.
  - Use these tests to detect and fix any issues with the patterns.

- **Advice 6**: **Refine Rule Conditions to Increase Training Support**

  - Re-evaluate rules with zero or low training support.
  - **Example Adjustments:**
    - **Rule 12 (Perfluorinated Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids):**
      - Broaden the rule to include molecules with a certain percentage of fluorinated carbons instead of requiring full perfluorination.

    - **Rule 6 (Polyols):**
      - Adjust the minimum number of hydroxyl groups required to match more compounds in the dataset.

  - By making conditions less restrictive, more molecules in the dataset will match the rules, improving their utility.

- **Advice 7**: **Ensure Consistent Naming and Clarity in Patterns**

  - Standardize the naming conventions for SMARTS patterns.
  - **Example:**
    - Use `'thiol_aliphatic'` and `'thiol_aromatic'` consistently throughout the code.
  - Clear and consistent naming improves code readability and reduces confusion during development and maintenance.

- **Advice 8**: **Comment and Document the Code**

  - Add descriptive comments explaining the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and code block.
  - Document any assumptions made in the rules and patterns.
  - Well-documented code facilitates collaboration and future updates.

- **Advice 9**: **Collaborate with Domain Experts**

  - Engage chemists or experienced researchers to review the rules and patterns.
  - Validate the chemical relevance and accuracy of the rules based on expert knowledge.
  - Collaboration helps ensure that the rules reflect true chemical behavior and improves their predictive power.

- **Advice 10**: **Incorporate Data Analysis Insights**

  - Analyze the dataset to identify patterns or correlations that may inform rule refinement.
  - Use statistical methods or machine learning techniques to detect features significantly affecting yield.
  - Adjust existing rules or create new ones based on data-driven insights.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an α-amino group and dual carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the electrophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen, promoting stronger coordination with the metal center and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position yield low value.**
  - *Example*: 4-methylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups reduce the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination and diminishing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with amino groups located three to five carbons away from the carboxyl group yield high value; those with amino groups more than five carbons away yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal proximity of the amino group enhances chelation with the metal center, while distant amino groups are less effective in coordination.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value.**
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are susceptible to side reactions and can form coordination complexes that deactivate the catalyst, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) yield high value.**
  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous hydrogen-bonding and coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center and improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids yield low value.**
  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: The high electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination and decreasing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on aliphatic chains yield high value.**
  - *Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups are strong nucleophiles that can effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as strong ligands, coordinating with the metal center and improving catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (six carbons or more) without interfering functional groups yield high value.**
  - *Example*: Octanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate accessibility and facilitate better interaction with the catalyst, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups on aliphatic chains yield low value.**
  - *Example*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can form chelates with the metal center that are detrimental to catalytic activity or compete with active sites, reducing efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages without additional coordinating groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weaker donors and provide limited coordination with metal centers, resulting in lower catalytic performance.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached via aliphatic chains of four carbons or more yield high value; those with shorter chains yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers provide flexibility, allowing phenolic hydroxyls to effectively coordinate with the metal center, whereas shorter chains limit this interaction.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value when additional coordinating groups are present.**
  - *Example*: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density, enhancing interactions with the metal center when combined with other coordinating functionalities.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with multiple coordinating groups in proximity (e.g., amino and hydroxyl groups) yield high value.**
  - *Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of multiple ligating atoms near each other enhances the ability to form stable chelates with the metal center, improving catalytic activity.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Modify the SMARTS patterns to be less restrictive regarding stereochemistry and implicit hydrogens. For instance, in Rule 1, alter the `alpha_amino_acid_backbone` pattern from `[NX3H2][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` to `[NX3H2][C][C](=O)[O]` or `[N][C][C](=O)[O]` to account for molecules with stereochemistry annotations like `[C@@H]` and implicit hydrogens.
  
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Update the `hydroxyl_group` pattern in Rule 6 to match hydroxyl groups with implicit hydrogens. Change `[OX2H]` to `[OX2H,OX2]` or simply `[OH]` to ensure it captures all hydroxyl groups, regardless of hydrogen representation.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Ensure that the `carboxylic_acid` pattern accounts for carboxylate forms and variations in hydrogen representation. Modify `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` to `[C](=O)[O,H]` or `[C](=O)[O-]` to include both protonated and deprotonated carboxylic acids.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Incorporate additional patterns or adjust existing ones to recognize functional groups in different molecular environments. For example, in Rule 6, consider patterns that detect hydroxyl groups attached to carbons with varying hybridization states or in ring systems.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Use the `ignoreHs=True` parameter in RDKit's `GetSubstructMatches` function to ignore explicit hydrogens, making the matching process more flexible and accommodating molecules with different hydrogen representations.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Test each SMARTS pattern individually against a set of known molecules to validate their correctness. Iterate on the patterns based on these tests to improve matching accuracy before applying them to the full dataset.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For molecules with multiple functional groups that may overlap, ensure that the code logic allows for multiple matches and does not prematurely exclude potential matches due to strict pattern grouping.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Add error handling or logging within the code to identify SMILES strings that fail to match due to parsing errors or unexpected molecular features. This will aid in debugging and refining the SMARTS patterns.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Consult the RDKit SMARTS tutorial and documentation to refine the patterns, ensuring they align with best practices and capture the intended functional groups accurately.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Consider using more general SMARTS patterns or combining multiple patterns with logical OR operators to broaden the scope of matching while still adhering to the rules' intent.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Reformulate rules to focus on quantifiable molecular descriptors.** Instead of qualitative descriptions, redefine rules using descriptors like the number of specific functional groups (e.g., count of carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl groups), molecular weight, or topological features. This shift enables direct numerical representation from SMILES.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize substructure patterns that can be identified computationally.** Design rules based on SMARTS patterns corresponding to functional groups or structural motifs. For example, specify substructures for α-amino acids or benzoic acids with particular substituents, which can be programmatically detected and counted.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate electronic properties using calculable parameters.** Replace terms like "electron-withdrawing groups" with quantifiable properties such as Hammett sigma constants or Taft parameters. These values can be assigned numerically to substituents directly from their SMILES representations.

- **Advice 4**: **Quantify distances between functional groups along the molecular backbone.** For rules dependent on the position of functional groups (e.g., amino group location relative to carboxyl group), calculate the number of atoms between these groups from the SMILES string to create a numerical feature.

- **Advice 5**: **Encode ring substituent effects numerically.** For aromatic systems, assign numerical values based on substituent position (ortho, meta, para) and type (electron-donating or withdrawing). Use position indices and electronic effect constants to generate features from SMILES data.

- **Advice 6**: **Calculate physicochemical properties as features.** Employ computational tools to derive properties such as logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), polar surface area, and solubility from the SMILES strings. These properties can influence catalyst interaction and are valuable for modeling.

- **Advice 7**: **Standardize functional group definitions for consistent encoding.** Define clear criteria for what constitutes each functional group (e.g., thiol, aldehyde, ketone) and ensure these can be consistently identified in SMILES strings using cheminformatics software, facilitating accurate feature extraction.

- **Advice 8**: **Implement molecular fingerprints for comprehensive feature sets.** Use algorithms like ECFP (Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints) or MACCS keys to convert SMILES into binary or count-based fingerprints that represent the presence or absence of substructures numerically.

- **Advice 9**: **Quantify steric factors using calculated molecular dimensions.** Include descriptors such as molecular volume, surface area, or steric hindrance indices to account for the impact of modifier size and shape on catalytic activity.

- **Advice 10**: **Revise rules to include threshold values for numerical features.** For instance, instead of stating "long aliphatic chains yield high value," specify "modifiers with aliphatic chains longer than six carbons yield high value," which can be directly measured and encoded from the SMILES strings.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**Glutamic acid**), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**Aspartic acid**).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an α-amino group and dual carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with functional groups capable of metal coordination at the para position yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups like amino, nitro, and bromomethyl can coordinate with metal centers, promoting stronger interactions and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with non-coordinating groups at the para position yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Non-coordinating substituents like methyl groups do not enhance metal binding, leading to weaker catalyst interactions and lower yields.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with amino groups located within five carbons of the carboxyl group yield high value; those with amino groups farther away yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl enhances chelation with the metal center, while distant amino groups are less effective, diminishing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are susceptible to side reactions and can form inactive complexes with the metal, deactivating the catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**Gluconic acid**), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and hydrogen-bonding interactions, enhancing metal complexation and catalyst performance.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: The high electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination and decreasing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups yield high value when the thiol is on an aliphatic chain, but yield low value when the thiol is attached to an aromatic ring.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are more flexible and effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity, whereas aromatic thiols are less effective due to delocalization and steric hindrance.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (**Niacin**), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group act as strong chelating agents, coordinating with the metal center and improving catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (seven carbons or more) without additional functional groups yield high value.**
  - *Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate accessibility and facilitate better interactions with the catalyst, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups on aliphatic chains yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can form non-productive chelates with the metal center or compete with active sites, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages without additional coordinating groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weaker donors and provide limited coordination with metal centers, resulting in lower catalytic performance.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached via aliphatic chains of four carbons or more yield high value; those with shorter chains yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers provide flexibility, allowing phenolic hydroxyls to effectively coordinate with the metal center, whereas shorter chains limit this interaction due to steric constraints.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value only when additional coordinating groups are present.**
  - *Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, but effective coordination requires additional functional groups (e.g., carbonyl) to enhance metal binding.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation reduces the availability of the amino group for metal coordination, diminishing its ability to enhance catalyst activity.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight regarding the deactivating effects of aldehyde groups. It is straightforward but lacks complexity, focusing on a single functional group. The rule meets the coverage criterion with two supporting data points (entries 18 and 19).

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** clearly identifies modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, offering good property insight into enhanced metal complexation. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by two data points (entries 6 and 8), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear and provides logical property insight but is only supported by one data point (entry 13). The lack of sufficient coverage diminishes its reliability.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is clear in distinguishing between aliphatic and aromatic thiols. It provides solid property insight and considers the context of the thiol group, satisfying the complexity criterion. With two supporting data points (entries 9 and 17), it meets the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear and insightful regarding nitrogen heterocycles enhancing coordination. It considers specific structural features and is supported by two data points (entries 15 and 21), fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear but only supported by one data point (entry 5). Despite acceptable property insight, the limited coverage reduces its effectiveness.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear and provides reasonable rationale but lacks sufficient data support with only one supporting data point (entry 27), undermining its overall validity.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** is clear and explains why ether linkages without coordinating groups yield low value. It considers the combination of structural features and is supported by two data points (entries 10 and 32), satisfying coverage.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** provides clear guidelines based on chain length and phenolic hydroxyl groups. It offers good property insight, considers structural combinations, and is supported by two data points (entries 7 and 30).

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** is somewhat ambiguous regarding "additional coordinating groups," which could affect clarity. It has acceptable property insight but is only supported by one data point (entry 25), limiting its coverage.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is clear and explains how acylation affects amino group coordination. It considers functional group modifications and is supported by two data points (entries 28 and 33), meeting the coverage criterion.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**Glutamic acid**), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**Aspartic acid**).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an α-amino group and dual carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with functional groups capable of metal coordination at the para position yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups like amino, nitro, and bromomethyl can coordinate with metal centers, promoting stronger interactions and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with non-coordinating groups at the para position yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Non-coordinating substituents like methyl groups do not enhance metal binding, leading to weaker catalyst interactions and lower yields.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with amino groups located within five carbons of the carboxyl group yield high value; those with amino groups farther away yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl enhances chelation with the metal center, while distant amino groups are less effective, diminishing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are susceptible to side reactions and can form inactive complexes with the metal, deactivating the catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**Gluconic acid**), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and hydrogen-bonding interactions, enhancing metal complexation and catalyst performance.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: The high electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination and decreasing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups yield high value when the thiol is on an aliphatic chain, but yield low value when the thiol is attached to an aromatic ring.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are more flexible and effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity, whereas aromatic thiols are less effective due to delocalization and steric hindrance.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (**Niacin**), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group act as strong chelating agents, coordinating with the metal center and improving catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (seven carbons or more) without additional functional groups yield high value.**
  - *Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate accessibility and facilitate better interactions with the catalyst, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups on aliphatic chains yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can form non-productive chelates with the metal center or compete with active sites, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages without additional coordinating groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weaker donors and provide limited coordination with metal centers, resulting in lower catalytic performance.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached via aliphatic chains of four carbons or more yield high value; those with shorter chains yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers provide flexibility, allowing phenolic hydroxyls to effectively coordinate with the metal center, whereas shorter chains limit this interaction due to steric constraints.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value only when additional coordinating groups are present.**
  - *Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, but effective coordination requires additional functional groups (e.g., carbonyl) to enhance metal binding.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation reduces the availability of the amino group for metal coordination, diminishing its ability to enhance catalyst activity.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: Correct the SMARTS pattern in **Rule 2** to accurately match **para-substituted benzoic acids** with functional groups capable of metal coordination at the para position. The current implementation does not correctly specify the position of the substituent, resulting in false negatives. Use a SMARTS pattern that ensures the functional group is at the **para position** relative to the carboxylic acid. For example, modify the SMARTS pattern to `'c1cc([#6])cc(C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])c1[*]'`, where `[*]` represents the functional group in the para position opposite to the carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: In **Rule 2**, ensure the matching functional groups are correctly specified. Currently, functional groups like `[Br]`, `[Cl]`, `[F]`, `[I]` are included, but halogens are generally not capable of metal coordination. Replace these with functional groups known for coordination, such as `[OX2H]` (hydroxyl), `[NX3;H2,H1;!$(NC=O)]` (amino groups), or other coordinating groups like `[SX2H]` (thiol).

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Verify the **'benzoic_acid'** pattern in the code. Ensure that it matches benzoic acid correctly and that the position numbering aligns with the SMARTS patterns used in the rules. The current pattern might not correctly identify substituted benzoic acids due to position mismatches.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For **Rule 13**, clarify the SMARTS patterns for phenolic hydroxyl groups attached via aliphatic chains of varying lengths. Ensure that the patterns accurately distinguish between long-chain (four carbons or more) and short-chain linkers. Consider using quantifiers in SMARTS to specify the exact length of the aliphatic chain.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Review and adjust other SMARTS patterns where position and connectivity are critical, such as in **Rules 8** and **9**, to ensure that they precisely match the intended substructures in the molecules.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Include additional checks or debugging statements in the code to output which substructures are matched for each molecule and rule. This will help in verifying the correctness of pattern matches and facilitate debugging.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Consider writing unit tests for each rule, using known molecules that should match (positive controls) and known molecules that should not match (negative controls), to validate the correctness of the SMARTS patterns and logic.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

Based on the provided metrics and comparing them with the reference metrics, we can make the following observations focusing on **confidence** and **lift**.

---

### **1. Support**

- **Current Train Support**: **0.0705**
- **Previous Average Train Support**: Approximately **0.1756**

**Comment**: The current train support is lower than the previous average. This indicates that the current rules are applicable to a smaller portion of the training data compared to the previous rules. Lower support may suggest that while the rules are specific, they may not cover enough instances to be broadly impactful.

---

### **2. Confidence**

- **Current Train Confidence**: **0.7048**
- **Previous Average Train Confidence**: Approximately **0.5874**

**Comment**: The current train confidence is higher than the previous average. This means that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of the rule prediction being correct has increased. A higher confidence reflects improved precision of the rules.

---

### **3. Lift**

- **Current Train Lift**: **1.4161**
- **Previous Average Train Lift**: Approximately **1.1304**

**Comment**: The current train lift is significantly higher than the previous average. Lift values greater than 1 indicate that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. An increase in lift suggests that the current rules have a stronger association between the conditions and the prediction.

---

### **4. Leverage**

- **Current Train Leverage**: **0.0175**
- **Previous Average Train Leverage**: Approximately **0.0124**

**Comment**: The current leverage is higher than the previous average and is positive. Positive leverage indicates that the rule has a stronger association than would be expected if the condition and the prediction were independent. The higher leverage signifies that the current rules contribute more to the model's predictive power.

---

### **5. Zero Support Rules**

- **Observation**: There is a rule with **Train Support** of **0.0**, **Confidence** of **0.5**, **Lift** of **1.0**, and **Leverage** of **0.0**.

**Comment**: A rule with zero support implies it does not apply to any instances in the training data. Such a rule does not contribute to the predictive capability and may need to be revised or removed.

---

**Overall Assessment**

- The current rules exhibit **higher confidence and lift** compared to previous metrics, indicating that they are more precise and have a stronger predictive power when they apply.
- However, the **lower support** suggests that these rules apply to fewer instances in the dataset, potentially limiting their overall impact.
- The presence of rules with zero support is a concern and indicates that some rules may not be valid or applicable to the current dataset.

---

**Evaluation of Local Minimum and Iterations**

Given the current metrics:

- The **increase in confidence and lift** suggests that the rules have improved in their predictive accuracy.
- The **decrease in support** indicates that the rules have become more specific, possibly too specific, reducing their general applicability.
- The **improvement in leverage** shows a stronger association between conditions and predictions, but the modest increase suggests diminishing returns.

Considering these factors, it's possible that we've reached a **local maximum** in terms of rule precision but a **local minimum** in terms of coverage.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Increase Rule Support Without Sacrificing Confidence and Lift**:

   - **Generalize Some Rules**: Examine if some rules can be broadened to cover more instances while still maintaining high confidence and lift.
   - **Combine Similar Rules**: Identify rules with overlapping conditions and merge them to improve support.

2. **Review and Revise Rules with Zero Support**:

   - **Remove Non-contributive Rules**: Eliminate rules that do not apply to any data instances.
   - **Validate Data Consistency**: Ensure that the dataset hasn't changed in a way that invalidates certain rules.

3. **Balance Specificity and Generality**:

   - **Avoid Overfitting**: Highly specific rules may not perform well on new data. Strive for rules that generalize well.
   - **Introduce Partial Matches**: Allow for rules that apply when most, but not all, conditions are met to increase support.

4. **Incorporate Test Metrics**:

   - **Evaluate on Test Data**: Assess the rules using test metrics to ensure they perform well on unseen data.
   - **Monitor Overfitting**: If test confidence and lift are significantly lower than training metrics, adjust the rules to improve generalization.

5. **Explore Additional Data Features**:

   - **Identify New Predictive Features**: Look for other attributes in the data that could enhance the rules' predictive power.
   - **Use Feature Engineering**: Create new features that capture important patterns not currently represented.

6. **Iterative Refinement**:

   - **Conduct Further Iterations**: Continue refining the rules, monitoring changes in support, confidence, lift, and leverage.
   - **Set Thresholds for Metrics**: Define acceptable ranges for metrics to decide when satisfactory performance is achieved.

---

**Conclusion**

While the current rules demonstrate high confidence and lift, indicating strong predictive ability when they apply, the low support suggests they affect only a small subset of the data. To enhance the overall effectiveness of the model, focus on increasing the support of the rules without compromising their accuracy. This may involve generalizing certain rules, removing ineffective ones, and ensuring that the rules are not overfitted to the training data. By balancing precision with coverage, the rules can be made more robust and applicable to a broader range of instances.

---

**Next Steps**

- **Re-evaluate the Current Rules**: Identify which rules can be adjusted to increase support.
- **Test Adjusted Rules**: Use both training and test datasets to assess the impact of changes.
- **Monitor Metrics**: Pay close attention to how changes affect confidence, lift, and support.
- **Aim for Balance**: Strive for rules that have acceptable levels of support, high confidence, and lift significantly greater than 1.

**Final Note**

Continued iterative refinement, guided by the metrics and focused on balancing rule coverage and predictive strength, will lead to the development of a more effective and reliable set of rules for the catalytic problem at hand.

ML Commenter Message:
**Comments on Accuracies:**

The current 5-fold validation accuracy of the classification model is **0.6**, which represents a decrease from previous validation accuracies that were consistently around **0.76**. This decline indicates that the model's performance has deteriorated in the current iteration compared to earlier versions. The previous test accuracies were also higher, ranging from **0.75** to **0.625**, while the current test accuracy is not provided but is likely consistent with the lower validation accuracy. The reduced accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data as effectively as before.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis reveals that **Rule 15** is the primary contributor to the model's predictions in the current iteration. Specifically:

- **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**
  - For several molecules where the model predicts a high modifier loading but the experimental value is low, **Rule 15** exhibits a **high positive SHAP value**. This suggests that Rule 15 is contributing significantly to the overestimation.

- **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**
  - Conversely, in cases where the model predicts a low modifier loading but the experimental value is high, **Rule 15** shows a **high negative SHAP value**. This implies that Rule 15 is influencing the model to underestimate the modifier loading in these instances.

The consistent pattern of Rule 15 having significant positive or negative SHAP values in mispredictions indicates that this rule may be disproportionately affecting the model's outputs, potentially overshadowing other relevant features.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

The decline in validation accuracy, coupled with the model's heavy reliance on a single rule (Rule 15), suggests that the current model is likely **underfitting** the data:

- **Underfitting Indicators:**
  - The model's simplicity, due to the apparent exclusion or minimal impact of other rules, prevents it from capturing the complexity and variability inherent in the dataset.
  - The reduced number of features (rules) contributing to the predictions limits the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, resulting in lower accuracy.

- **Contrast with Overfitting:**
  - If the model were overfitting, we would expect high training accuracy but low validation accuracy. However, the validation accuracy is low, and there's no indication of high training accuracy provided.

**Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values:**

By examining the molecules with prediction errors:

- **Molecules with Overestimated Loadings:**
  - **Rule 15** consistently has a high positive SHAP value, driving the prediction towards a high loading when the experimental value is low.
  - This indicates that Rule 15 may be too broadly defined or not adequately accounting for certain molecular features that lead to low loadings.

- **Molecules with Underestimated Loadings:**
  - **Rule 15** has a high negative SHAP value, leading the model to predict a low loading when the experimental value is high.
  - This suggests that Rule 15 may be suppressing the prediction of high loading in cases where it should not, possibly due to overlapping criteria with other high-loading indicators.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

The current accuracy metrics do not suggest an improvement in the model's performance:

- The decrease from previous validation accuracies (~0.76) to the current value (0.6) indicates that recent changes to the rules have not enhanced the model's predictive capability.
- The model may have regressed due to the over-reliance on Rule 15 and the potential exclusion of other informative rules.

**Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

The SHAP analysis provides valuable insights into how Rule 15 is impacting the model:

- **Dominance of Rule 15:**
  - The significant SHAP values associated with Rule 15 imply that it is the dominant feature influencing the model's predictions.
  - Such dominance can be problematic if the rule is not accurately capturing the nuances of the data, leading to systematic errors.

- **Opportunity for Refinement:**
  - The misalignment between the predicted and experimental values in cases heavily influenced by Rule 15 indicates that this rule requires refinement.
  - There is a need to reassess the conditions and applicability of Rule 15 to ensure it contributes positively to the model's accuracy.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules:**

Based on the latest training results:

- **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
  - The current rules, especially Rule 15, are not effectively capturing the patterns necessary for accurate predictions.
  - The diminished validation accuracy suggests that the model's ability to generalize has been compromised.

- **Comparison with Baseline Metrics:**
  - The previous models with higher validation accuracies serve as a baseline, highlighting that the current iteration is underperforming.
  - The reduced accuracy indicates that the iterative process may have reached a local minimum, and further refinements are necessary to escape it.

- **Sufficiency of Iterations:**
  - Given the declining performance, it appears that there have not been enough effective iterations to adequately refine the rules.
  - Additional iterations focusing on the incorporation and adjustment of multiple rules are needed to improve the model.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

To enhance the current rules and improve the model's performance, the following actions are recommended:

1. **Refine Rule 15:**

   - **Reevaluate Definition:**
     - Examine the specific criteria of Rule 15 ("Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low value") to ensure it accurately captures the intended molecular features.
     - Consider whether the rule is too general or lacks specificity, leading to misclassification.

   - **Adjust Applicability:**
     - Modify Rule 15 to include exceptions or additional conditions that address cases where acylated amino groups do not result in low modifier loading.
     - Ensure that Rule 15 does not override other rules when not appropriate.

2. **Incorporate Additional Rules:**

   - **Reintroduce Previously Used Rules:**
     - Reintegrate other rules (Rules 1-14) that were effective in previous iterations and contributed to higher accuracies.
     - Analyze the impact of each rule individually to understand its contribution to the model.

   - **Balance Feature Contributions:**
     - Avoid over-reliance on a single rule by ensuring that multiple rules are factored into the model's predictions.
     - Use regularization techniques to balance the weights of the features derived from the rules.

3. **Adjust Rules with High SHAP Values in Misclassifications:**

   - **Overestimated Loadings:**
     - For molecules where predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, identify rules with high positive SHAP values and refine them to reduce overestimation.
     - In this case, adjust Rule 15 to prevent it from incorrectly promoting high loading predictions.

   - **Underestimated Loadings:**
     - For molecules where predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, identify rules with high negative SHAP values and modify them to prevent underestimation.
     - Ensure that Rule 15 does not unduly suppress the prediction of high loading in appropriate cases.

4. **Improve Generalization:**

   - **Enhance Rule Generality:**
     - Modify the rules to be more generalizable across different molecules, capturing broader patterns without being overly specific.
     - Avoid rules that are too narrow or only applicable to a limited set of compounds.

   - **Prevent Underfitting:**
     - Increase the complexity of the model by incorporating a diverse set of rules to better capture the variability in the data.
     - Ensure that the model has sufficient capacity to learn the underlying relationships.

5. **Use SHAP Analysis to Refine Rules:**

   - **Iterative Refinement:**
     - Continuously use SHAP analysis to identify the impact of each rule on the model's predictions.
     - Adjust rules based on their SHAP contributions, focusing on those that lead to mispredictions.

   - **Feature Importance Evaluation:**
     - Assess the importance of each rule in the model and prioritize refining rules that have the most significant impact on predictions.

6. **Validate Rule Adjustments with Data:**

   - **Cross-Validation:**
     - Use cross-validation techniques to test the effectiveness of rule adjustments on different subsets of the data.
     - Ensure that improvements are consistent across validation folds.

   - **Expert Consultation:**
     - Collaborate with domain experts to validate the scientific rationale behind each rule and its modifications.
     - Incorporate chemical knowledge to inform rule adjustments.

7. **Consider Additional Features:**

   - **Introduce New Rules:**
     - Explore the possibility of defining new rules that capture additional molecular features relevant to modifier loading.
     - Use exploratory data analysis to identify potential patterns or relationships not currently addressed by existing rules.

   - **Leverage Computational Descriptors:**
     - Incorporate computational molecular descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, polarity, electronic properties) as features to enhance the model.

**Conclusion:**

The current model's performance indicates a need for a more balanced and comprehensive approach. By refining Rule 15, reintroducing other effective rules, and carefully analyzing the contributions of each rule through SHAP analysis, we can improve the model's predictive accuracy. Focusing on enhancing the generalization capabilities of the rules and preventing underfitting will lead to a more robust model capable of accurately predicting modifier loading across a diverse set of molecules.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current analysis of the catalytic reaction involving remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization has highlighted several areas where the existing rules can be improved to enhance the yield prediction accuracy. The key points from the discussions are as follows:

1. **Rule Metrics Analysis**:
   - The **current rules exhibit higher confidence and lift** compared to previous iterations, indicating stronger predictive power when they apply.
   - However, **low support** suggests that these rules apply to a smaller subset of the data, potentially limiting their overall impact.
   - A rule with **zero support** indicates it doesn't contribute to predictions and may need revision or removal.

2. **Accuracy and SHAP Analysis**:
   - The **validation accuracy has declined** from previous models (from ~76% to 60%), suggesting deteriorated model performance.
   - **SHAP analysis** reveals that **Rule 15** is disproportionately influencing predictions, leading to both overestimations and underestimations of modifier loading.
   - The model appears to be **underfitting**, as it's overly reliant on Rule 15 and isn't capturing the complexity of the dataset.

3. **Rule-Specific Issues**:
   - **Rule 2**: The SMARTS pattern does not accurately match para-substituted benzoic acids with coordinating functional groups due to incorrect specification of substituent positions and functional groups.
   - **Rule 13**: The patterns for phenolic hydroxyl groups attached via aliphatic chains need clarification to distinguish between long and short chains accurately.
   - **Rule 8 and Rule 9**: Position and connectivity in SMARTS patterns may not precisely match intended substructures.
   - **General SMARTS Patterns**: There may be mismatches in position numbering and pattern definitions, affecting rule applicability.

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**

To optimize the current rules and enhance model performance, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns in Rules**:
   - **Rule 2**:
     - **Correct Substituent Positioning**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to ensure the functional group is at the **para position** relative to the carboxylic acid. Use patterns like `c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O` with the substituent specified at the para position.
     - **Specify Coordinating Functional Groups**: Replace halogen groups with functional groups capable of metal coordination, such as amino (`[NH2]`), hydroxyl (`[OH]`), or thiol (`[SH]`) groups.
   - **Rule 13**:
     - **Clarify Chain Lengths**: Use SMARTS quantifiers to specify aliphatic chain lengths, distinguishing between chains of four carbons or more and shorter chains. For example, use `CCCCc1ccc(O)cc1` for long chains.

2. **Adjust and Validate Other Rules**:
   - **Rule 15**:
     - **Refine Criteria**: Reevaluate the definition of Rule 15 to ensure it doesn't overly generalize. Consider adding conditions or exceptions where acylated amino groups do not lead to low yields.
     - **Balance Influence**: Modify the rule so it doesn't overshadow other important features, reducing its disproportionate impact on predictions.
   - **Rules 8 and 9**:
     - **Verify Position and Connectivity**: Ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately reflect the intended molecular structures, particularly concerning the locations of functional groups.

3. **Increase Rule Support Without Sacrificing Confidence**:
   - **Generalize Certain Rules**: Broaden rules where possible to cover more instances while maintaining high confidence. For example, expand the criteria in rules that currently have very narrow applicability.
   - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge overlapping rules to improve their support and overall impact on the model.

4. **Enhance Model Complexity to Prevent Underfitting**:
   - **Incorporate Additional Rules**: Reintroduce effective rules from previous iterations (Rules 1-14) that contributed to higher accuracies.
   - **Balance Feature Contributions**: Ensure that multiple rules contribute to the model's predictions, preventing over-reliance on any single rule.

5. **Improve SMARTS Pattern Verification**:
   - **Debugging and Testing**:
     - Implement checks or output statements to confirm which substructures are matched for each molecule and rule.
     - Write unit tests for each rule using known positive and negative controls to validate SMARTS patterns.
   - **Pattern Consistency**:
     - Verify that all SMARTS patterns use consistent atom numbering and nomenclature to avoid mismatches.

6. **Leverage SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement**:
   - Use SHAP values to identify how each rule contributes to predictions, especially in misclassified cases.
   - Adjust rules that consistently show high SHAP values in incorrect predictions, refining their definitions or applicability.

7. **Avoid Overfitting While Optimizing**:
   - **Balance Specificity and Generality**: Ensure that rules are neither too specific (causing low support) nor too general (reducing confidence).
   - **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation to test rule adjustments on different data subsets, ensuring generalizability.

8. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features**:
   - **Explore New Predictive Features**: Identify other molecular descriptors that could enhance predictive power, such as electronic properties or steric factors.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create composite features that capture complex interactions not addressed by existing rules.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Yes, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the SMARTS patterns, balancing the influence of individual rules, and ensuring that the model incorporates a diverse set of well-defined rules, the predictive performance can be enhanced while maintaining generalizability. The goal is to improve accuracy by correctly capturing the underlying chemical principles affecting catalyst performance, rather than fitting to noise in the data.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**Glutamic acid**), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**Aspartic acid**).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an α-amino group and dual carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with functional groups capable of metal coordination at the para position yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups like amino, nitro, and bromomethyl can coordinate with metal centers, promoting stronger interactions and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with non-coordinating groups at the para position yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Non-coordinating substituents like methyl groups do not enhance metal binding, leading to weaker catalyst interactions and lower yields.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with amino groups located within five carbons of the carboxyl group yield high value; those with amino groups farther away yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl enhances chelation with the metal center, while distant amino groups are less effective, diminishing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are susceptible to side reactions and can form inactive complexes with the metal, deactivating the catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**Gluconic acid**), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and hydrogen-bonding interactions, enhancing metal complexation and catalyst performance.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: The high electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination and decreasing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups yield high value when the thiol is on an aliphatic chain, but yield low value when the thiol is attached to an aromatic ring.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are more flexible and effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity, whereas aromatic thiols are less effective due to delocalization and steric hindrance.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (**Niacin**), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group act as strong chelating agents, coordinating with the metal center and improving catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (seven carbons or more) without additional functional groups yield high value.**
  - *Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate accessibility and facilitate better interactions with the catalyst, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups on aliphatic chains yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can form non-productive chelates with the metal center or compete with active sites, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages without additional coordinating groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weaker donors and provide limited coordination with metal centers, resulting in lower catalytic performance.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached via aliphatic chains of four carbons or more yield high value; those with shorter chains yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers provide flexibility, allowing phenolic hydroxyls to effectively coordinate with the metal center, whereas shorter chains limit this interaction due to steric constraints.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value only when additional coordinating groups are present.**
  - *Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, but effective coordination requires additional functional groups (e.g., carbonyl) to enhance metal binding.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation reduces the availability of the amino group for metal coordination, diminishing its ability to enhance catalyst activity.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **
- ** Advice 1 **: **Refine the SMARTS pattern in Rule 2 to accurately match para-substituted benzoic acids with coordinating functional groups.**
  - *Action*: Modify the SMARTS pattern to specify the substituent at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group and ensure it includes functional groups capable of metal coordination such as amino (`[NH2]`), nitro (`[N+](=O)[O-]`), or bromomethyl groups (`CBr`).
  - *Example SMARTS*: `c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)[NX3;H2]` for para-aminobenzoic acid, or `c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)[N+](=O)[O-]` for para-nitrobenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: This ensures the rule correctly identifies molecules where the coordinating group is at the para position, enhancing the rule's applicability and accuracy.

- ** Advice 2 **: **Clarify and correct the SMARTS patterns in Rule 13 to distinguish chain lengths accurately for phenolic hydroxyl modifiers.**
  - *Action*: Use SMARTS atom counts to specify aliphatic chain lengths between the phenolic hydroxyl group and the carboxylic acid. For high yield, require chains of four or more carbons; for low yield, chains of fewer than four carbons.
  - *High Yield SMARTS Example*: `O-c1ccc(cc1)-CCCC-C(=O)O` (indicates four carbon linker).
  - *Low Yield SMARTS Example*: `O-c1ccc(cc1)-CC-C(=O)O` (indicates two carbon linker).
  - *Rationale*: Accurate chain length specification will improve the rule's ability to predict yield based on the modifier's structure.

- ** Advice 3 **: **Reevaluate Rule 15 to prevent it from disproportionately influencing model predictions.**
  - *Action*: Modify Rule 15 to include additional context, such as whether the acylated amino group is adjacent to other coordinating groups or not. Consider narrowing the rule's scope to specific cases where acylation clearly reduces metal coordination.
  - *Example Modification*: Specify that Rule 15 applies only when the acylated amino group is the primary coordination site and no other strong coordinating groups are present.
  - *Rationale*: This adjustment will reduce overgeneralization and decrease the rule's undue influence on the model.

- ** Advice 4 **: **Verify and correct SMARTS patterns in Rules 8 and 9 to ensure accurate position and connectivity of functional groups.**
  - *Rule 8 Action*: Adjust the SMARTS patterns to differentiate properly between aliphatic and aromatic thiols.
    - *Aliphatic Thiol SMARTS*: `[CX4][CX4][SH]` (for high yield).
    - *Aromatic Thiol SMARTS*: `c1ccc(SH)cc1` (for low yield).
  - *Rule 9 Action*: Ensure nitrogen heterocycles adjacent to the carboxyl group are correctly identified.
    - *SMARTS Example*: `n1cccc1C(=O)O` for pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Correcting these patterns will improve rule accuracy and ensure they apply to the intended molecules.

- ** Advice 5 **: **Increase rule support by generalizing certain rules without sacrificing confidence.**
  - *Action*: Broaden the criteria of rules with low support to cover more data points. For instance, expand rules to include functional group analogs or related coordinating groups that have similar effects on yield.
  - *Example*: In Rule 6 (polyols yielding high value), include modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups regardless of their specific arrangement.
  - *Rationale*: Higher support will enhance the model's overall predictive capability and applicability to a wider range of modifiers.

- ** Advice 6 **: **Implement thorough testing and validation of all SMARTS patterns used in the rules.**
  - *Action*: Write unit tests for each rule using known compounds to verify that the SMARTS patterns match the intended structures. Include both positive examples (should match) and negative examples (should not match).
  - *Rationale*: This will ensure that each rule functions as intended and help identify and correct any mismatches or errors in the patterns.

- ** Advice 7 **: **Use SHAP analysis to refine rules that contribute to incorrect predictions.**
  - *Action*: Identify rules with high SHAP values in misclassified instances and adjust them accordingly. This could involve refining the rule's criteria, modifying its scope, or adjusting its weight in the model.
  - *Rationale*: Adjusting these rules based on SHAP insights will enhance model accuracy and reduce misclassifications.

- ** Advice 8 **: **Reintroduce effective rules from previous iterations to improve model performance.**
  - *Action*: Review previous rules that contributed to higher accuracies and consider integrating them back into the model after ensuring their SMARTS patterns are accurate.
  - *Rationale*: Beneficial rules from earlier versions may enhance the model when combined with the current optimized rules.

- ** Advice 9 **: **Balance the influence of individual rules to prevent model underfitting or overfitting.**
  - *Action*: Adjust the weighting or significance of each rule so that no single rule dominates the model's predictions. Ensure that the model considers multiple factors and rules when making predictions.
  - *Rationale*: A balanced model will more accurately reflect the complex interactions affecting yield and improve predictive performance.

- ** Advice 10 **: **Incorporate additional molecular descriptors to capture other factors influencing reaction yield.**
  - *Action*: Include features such as electronic properties (e.g., electron-withdrawing/donating effects), steric hindrance, and hydrogen-bonding potential in the model.
  - *Rationale*: These additional descriptors can capture nuances not addressed by current rules and improve the model's ability to predict yields accurately.

** End of Advice **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic acids) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**Glutamic acid**), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**Aspartic acid**).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and dual carboxyl groups allows for strong chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity, which increases the yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating substituents at the para position yield high value; those with electron-donating or non-coordinating substituents yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups like amino, nitro, and bromomethyl enhance metal binding by increasing the acidity of the carboxyl group and providing additional coordination sites. Electron-donating groups like methyl reduce metal coordination, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with amino groups located within five carbons of the carboxyl group yield high value; those with amino groups farther away or acylated yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl enhances chelation with metal centers. Distant or acylated amino groups are less effective in metal coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**Gluconic acid**), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal ions and facilitate hydrogen bonding, enhancing metal complexation and improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing thiol (sulfhydryl) groups yield high value when the thiol is on an aliphatic chain; those with sulfur attached to aromatic rings or in thioethers yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Sulfur in aromatic systems or thioethers is less accessible for coordination due to steric hindrance or delocalization.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or form inactive complexes with metal ions, deactivating the catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: The electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination and decreasing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (**Niacin**), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as strong chelating agents with metal centers, enhancing coordination and improving catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low value unless additional strong coordinating groups are present.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weak donors for metal coordination. Without additional coordinating groups, the overall metal-binding ability is insufficient to enhance catalytic performance.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (with eight or more carbons) yield high value unless they contain interfering functional groups.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may improve substrate accessibility and stabilize the catalyst. Interfering groups (like distant amino groups) can disrupt metal coordination, reducing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups near the carboxyl group yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can chelate with metal centers in a way that competes with the active site or alters the catalyst structure, leading to decreased catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value only when additional coordinating groups are present.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density and can enhance metal interactions when coupled with other coordinating groups. Without them, the coordination is insufficient to impact the yield positively.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached via a five-carbon aliphatic chain yield high value; those with shorter chains yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl to effectively coordinate with the metal center. Shorter chains limit this interaction due to steric constraints.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of the amino group reduces its availability for metal coordination, diminishing its ability to enhance catalyst activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing amino groups directly attached to aromatic rings yield high value; those with amino groups on aliphatic chains yield high value only when the chain is short.**
  - *High Yield Example (Aromatic Amino Group)*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**.
  - *High Yield Example (Short Aliphatic Chain)**: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example**: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale**: Aromatic amino groups enhance metal coordination due to conjugation with the ring. Aliphatic amino groups are effective when close to the carboxyl group, enabling strong chelation; distant amino groups are less effective.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic acids) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**Glutamic acid**), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**Aspartic acid**).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and dual carboxyl groups allows for strong chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity, which increases the yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating substituents at the para position yield high value; those with electron-donating or non-coordinating substituents yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups like amino, nitro, and bromomethyl enhance metal binding by increasing the acidity of the carboxyl group and providing additional coordination sites. Electron-donating groups like methyl reduce metal coordination, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with amino groups located within five carbons of the carboxyl group yield high value; those with amino groups farther away or acylated yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl enhances chelation with metal centers. Distant or acylated amino groups are less effective in metal coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**Gluconic acid**), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal ions and facilitate hydrogen bonding, enhancing metal complexation and improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing thiol (sulfhydryl) groups yield high value when the thiol is on an aliphatic chain; those with sulfur attached to aromatic rings or in thioethers yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Sulfur in aromatic systems or thioethers is less accessible for coordination due to steric hindrance or delocalization.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or form inactive complexes with metal ions, deactivating the catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: The electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination and decreasing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (**Niacin**), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as strong chelating agents with metal centers, enhancing coordination and improving catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low value unless additional strong coordinating groups are present.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weak donors for metal coordination. Without additional coordinating groups, the overall metal-binding ability is insufficient to enhance catalytic performance.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (with eight or more carbons) yield high value unless they contain interfering functional groups.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may improve substrate accessibility and stabilize the catalyst. Interfering groups (like distant amino groups) can disrupt metal coordination, reducing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups near the carboxyl group yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can chelate with metal centers in a way that competes with the active site or alters the catalyst structure, leading to decreased catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value only when additional coordinating groups are present.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density and can enhance metal interactions when coupled with other coordinating groups. Without them, the coordination is insufficient to impact the yield positively.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached via a five-carbon aliphatic chain yield high value; those with shorter chains yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl to effectively coordinate with the metal center. Shorter chains limit this interaction due to steric constraints.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of the amino group reduces its availability for metal coordination, diminishing its ability to enhance catalyst activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing amino groups directly attached to aromatic rings yield high value; those with amino groups on aliphatic chains yield high value only when the chain is short.**
  - *High Yield Example (Aromatic Amino Group)*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**.
  - *High Yield Example (Short Aliphatic Chain)**: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example**: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale**: Aromatic amino groups enhance metal coordination due to conjugation with the ring. Aliphatic amino groups are effective when close to the carboxyl group, enabling strong chelation; distant amino groups are less effective.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Implement Rule 2** fully in the code. Currently, Rule 2 is skipped with a placeholder comment stating that positional analysis is complex. To capture benzoic acids with specific substituents at the para position, you should:

  - Use SMARTS patterns to identify benzoic acids: `[c]1ccccc1C(=O)O`.
  - Identify substituents at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group. This can be achieved by:

    - Locating the carboxylic acid group attached to the benzene ring.
    - Finding the atom opposite (para to) the carboxylic acid on the benzene ring.
    - Checking if that position has an electron-withdrawing or coordinating group (e.g., nitro `[N+](=O)[O-]`, amino `N`, halogens `F`, `Cl`, `Br`, `I`, etc.).

  - Assign a prediction of **1** for electron-withdrawing or coordinating substituents and **-1** for electron-donating or non-coordinating substituents.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Enhance positional analysis for rules involving specific locations** within molecules (Rules 2, 3, 5, 10, 13, and 15). Modify the code to:

  - Utilize atom mapping or hierarchical organization (e.g., use of mol.GetSubstructMatches with explicit SMARTS patterns that account for positions).
  - Accurately calculate distances in terms of carbon atoms for chains (e.g., counting carbon atoms between functional groups).

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine Rule 3** implementation by accurately calculating the number of carbon atoms separating the amino group and the carboxyl group:

  - Use breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path between the nitrogen of the amino group and the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid, counting only carbon atoms.
  - Exclude paths that pass through heteroatoms unless they are part of the backbone.
  - Adjust the code to account for acylated amino groups accurately by checking for the presence of an acyl group attached to the nitrogen.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Improve Rule 5** by differentiating thiol groups on aliphatic chains from those attached to aromatic rings or present in thioethers:

  - Use SMARTS patterns to identify aliphatic thiols: `[CX4][SX2H]`.
  - Detect aromatic sulfur atoms with patterns like: `[s]` for sulfur in aromatic rings.
  - Identify thioethers with patterns such as `[CX4][SX2][CX4]`.
  - Assign prediction **1** for aliphatic thiols and **-1** for sulfur attached to aromatics or in thioethers.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Implement Rule 9** by checking for the presence of ether linkages and assessing for additional strong coordinating groups:

  - Identify ethers with SMARTS: `[OD2]([#6])[#6]`.
  - Before assigning a prediction of **-1**, search for other coordinating groups (e.g., amines, carboxylic acids, thiols) within the molecule.
  - Adjust the prediction based on the presence or absence of these groups.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Implement Rule 12** to detect methoxy groups on aromatic rings and check for additional coordinating groups:

  - Use SMARTS to identify methoxy-substituted aromatics: `[c][OX2][CH3]`.
  - Search for additional coordinating groups in the molecule, such as amino (`[NX3;H2,H1,H0][#6]`), hydroxyl (`[OX2H]`), or carboxyl (`[CX3](=O)[OX2H1,O-]`) groups.
  - Assign a prediction of **1** only if such groups are present alongside the methoxy group.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Review and correct SMARTS patterns** used in the code to ensure they accurately represent the functional groups:

  - For the `long_chain` pattern in Rule 10, instead of `[C]*8`, which is not a valid SMARTS, use a recursive SMARTS pattern that matches aliphatic chains with eight or more carbons. For example: `[$([CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2])]`.

  - Ensure all SMARTS patterns are syntactically correct and match the intended structures.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Correct Rule 10** implementation to accurately detect long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids and interfering groups:

  - Use RDKit's `Chem.GetMolFrags()` and `rdMolDescriptors.CalcLipinskiVariables()` to find the longest aliphatic carbon chain.
  - Check if the molecule has a carboxylic acid group attached to the long chain.
  - Identify interfering functional groups (e.g., acylated amino groups, distant amino groups) using their respective SMARTS patterns.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Accurately calculate distances** in rules involving proximity (Rules 3, 10, 13, 15):

  - In Rule 3 and Rule 15, ensure that the distance (number of atoms or bonds) between functional groups is calculated correctly, considering only carbon atoms if specified.
  - Use RDKit's `GetShortestPath()` method with appropriate atom selection to measure distances as per the rules.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Remove unnecessary conditions or variables** that may cause incorrect matches:

  - Eliminate checks like `atom.GetAtomMapNum() == 0` unless `AtomMapNum` is specifically used in the molecule data.
  - Focus on chemically relevant properties (e.g., atomic number, hybridization, connectivity).

- **Suggestion 11**: **Test the code with known examples** after implementing changes:

  - Use the examples provided in each rule to validate your code. For instance, confirm that **4-aminobenzoic acid** correctly matches Rule 2 and is assigned a prediction of **1**.
  - Verify that the feature matrix aligns with expected outcomes for each molecule and rule.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic acids) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**Glutamic acid**), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**Aspartic acid**).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and dual carboxyl groups allows for strong chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity, which increases the yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating substituents at the para position yield high value; those with electron-donating or non-coordinating substituents yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups like amino, nitro, and bromomethyl enhance metal binding by increasing the acidity of the carboxyl group and providing additional coordination sites. Electron-donating groups like methyl reduce metal coordination, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with amino groups located within five carbons of the carboxyl group yield high value; those with amino groups farther away or acylated yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl enhances chelation with metal centers. Distant or acylated amino groups are less effective in metal coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**Gluconic acid**), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal ions and facilitate hydrogen bonding, enhancing metal complexation and improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing thiol (sulfhydryl) groups yield high value when the thiol is on an aliphatic chain; those with sulfur attached to aromatic rings or in thioethers yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Sulfur in aromatic systems or thioethers is less accessible for coordination due to steric hindrance or delocalization.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or form inactive complexes with metal ions, deactivating the catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: The electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination and decreasing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (**Niacin**), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as strong chelating agents with metal centers, enhancing coordination and improving catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low value unless additional strong coordinating groups are present.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weak donors for metal coordination. Without additional coordinating groups, the overall metal-binding ability is insufficient to enhance catalytic performance.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (with eight or more carbons) yield high value unless they contain interfering functional groups.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may improve substrate accessibility and stabilize the catalyst. Interfering groups (like distant amino groups) can disrupt metal coordination, reducing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups near the carboxyl group yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can chelate with metal centers in a way that competes with the active site or alters the catalyst structure, leading to decreased catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value only when additional coordinating groups are present.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density and can enhance metal interactions when coupled with other coordinating groups. Without them, the coordination is insufficient to impact the yield positively.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached via a five-carbon aliphatic chain yield high value; those with shorter chains yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl to effectively coordinate with the metal center. Shorter chains limit this interaction due to steric constraints.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of the amino group reduces its availability for metal coordination, diminishing its ability to enhance catalyst activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing amino groups directly attached to aromatic rings yield high value; those with amino groups on aliphatic chains yield high value only when the chain is short.**
  - *High Yield Example (Aromatic Amino Group)*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**.
  - *High Yield Example (Short Aliphatic Chain)**: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example**: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale**: Aromatic amino groups enhance metal coordination due to conjugation with the ring. Aliphatic amino groups are effective when close to the carboxyl group, enabling strong chelation; distant amino groups are less effective.

**Comments on the Performance of the Current Rules Based on the Current Metrics**

After analyzing the provided metrics and comparing the current rule performance with the reference (previous) metrics, several observations can be made regarding the effectiveness of the current rules, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**.

---

**Comparison with Reference Metrics:**

1. **Train Confidence:**
   - **Previous Mean Confidence:** Approximately 0.5874 (average of 0.6352 and 0.5396).
   - **Current Confidence:** 0.7023.
   - **Analysis:** There is a significant increase in train confidence from the previous mean to the current value. This indicates that a higher proportion of records with the specified rule conditions also have the rule predictions being true. The rules are, therefore, more reliable in predicting outcomes for the instances they cover.

2. **Train Lift:**
   - **Previous Mean Lift:** Approximately 1.1304 (average of 1.2048 and 1.0559).
   - **Current Lift:** 1.4018.
   - **Analysis:** The lift has increased notably, suggesting that the rules are better at identifying associations that are not due to chance. A lift significantly greater than 1 indicates that the occurrence of the rule prediction is more likely when the rule condition is present than at random. The current rules are, therefore, more effective at uncovering meaningful relationships in the data.

3. **Train Support:**
   - **Previous Mean Support:** Approximately 0.1756 (average of 0.1667 and 0.1845).
   - **Current Support:** 0.1371.
   - **Analysis:** There is a slight decrease in support, meaning the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset compared to before. While the rules are more precise (as indicated by higher confidence and lift), they cover fewer instances.

4. **Train Leverage:**
   - **Previous Mean Leverage:** Approximately 0.0124 (average of 0.0289 and -0.0041).
   - **Current Leverage:** 0.0263.
   - **Analysis:** An increase in leverage suggests that the rules have a stronger association than expected by chance, contributing positively to the rule's significance.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

The improvements in confidence and lift indicate that the current set of rules has moved closer to an optimal set of conditions for high predictive power and meaningful associations. However, the decrease in support suggests that while the rules are stronger, they are also more specific and potentially overlook a portion of the data.

From an optimization perspective:

- **Local Minimum Consideration:**
  - The increase in key metrics (confidence and lift) without observing significant negative trade-offs (e.g., drastic reduction in support) suggests that we may not have reached a local minimum. There is still room for improvement, especially in balancing support with confidence and lift.
  - The current rules might be overfitting to specific patterns in the training data, which could affect generalizability to new data.

- **Iterations Sufficiency:**
  - The data indicates positive progress, but the iterative process should continue until there's a convergence in metrics or until the adjustments no longer yield significant improvements.
  - Monitoring changes in metrics over subsequent iterations can help determine if the metrics plateau, indicating that further iterations may not yield substantial benefits.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules:**

1. **Balance Between Specificity and Generality:**
   - **Increase Support Without Compromising Confidence and Lift:**
     - Investigate if the rules can be slightly generalized to cover more data points while maintaining high confidence and lift.
     - For example, combining similar rules or relaxing overly strict conditions that limit applicability.

2. **Rule Refinement:**
   - **Analyze Low-Support High-Confidence Rules:**
     - Identify rules that have high confidence but very low support (e.g., rules applying to very few instances).
     - Assess whether these rules are capturing meaningful patterns or if they are artifacts of the training data.

3. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - **Expand Training Data:**
     - Adding more diverse data might help in discovering rules that are both broadly applicable and have high predictive power.
     - Ensure that the dataset captures all relevant variations in the modifiers and their effects on yield.

4. **Cross-Validation:**
   - **Validate Rules on Test Data:**
     - Apply the current rules to a separate test dataset to evaluate their performance outside the training data.
     - If the rules maintain high confidence and lift on the test data, it indicates good generalizability.

5. **Explore Intermediate Functional Groups:**
   - **Identify Overlooked Patterns:**
     - Re-examine functional groups or molecular features that may contribute to yield but have not been fully explored in the current rules.
     - Consider synergistic effects between different functional groups.

6. **Rule Pruning and Combination:**
   - **Eliminate Redundant Rules:**
     - Remove rules that do not significantly contribute to the predictive performance to simplify the rule set.
   - **Merge Similar Rules:**
     - Combine rules with overlapping conditions to increase support while maintaining high confidence and lift.

7. **Algorithmic Optimization:**
   - **Adjust Rule Generation Parameters:**
     - If using an algorithm to generate rules, tweak parameters such as minimum support thresholds or confidence levels to explore different rule sets.
   - **Implement Advanced Techniques:**
     - Utilize methods like association rule mining with constraints or probabilistic rule learning to discover more effective rules.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules shows improved performance concerning confidence and lift, indicating stronger and more reliable associations between the modifiers and the catalytic yield. However, the reduced support suggests that the rules are more narrowly focused and may not capture all relevant instances.

By striving to balance the breadth (support) and strength (confidence and lift) of the rules, we can enhance the overall performance and applicability of the rule set. Continued iterative refinement, validation on additional datasets, and strategic adjustments to rule conditions are recommended to achieve optimal results without prematurely concluding that a local minimum has been reached.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Monitor the changes in metrics over further iterations to detect convergence trends.**
- **Validate the current rules against unseen data to assess their generalizability.**
- **Engage in collaborative discussions to integrate domain expertise that may guide the identification of broader yet still meaningful rules.**

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules:**

**1. Evaluation of Effectiveness:**

The latest 5-fold validation performance yielded an accuracy of **0.8**, which is an improvement compared to previous iterations where accuracies ranged from **0.5143** to **0.76**. This suggests that the current set of rules is more effective in predicting the loading of modifiers on the catalyst. The higher accuracy indicates that the rules are capturing the underlying patterns in the data more accurately than before.

**2. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

Given the improvement in validation accuracy to **0.8**, there is evidence that the model is generalizing better to unseen data compared to previous iterations. However, the increase in accuracy alone does not rule out the possibility of overfitting. It's important to ensure that the model is not memorizing the training data but learning generalizable patterns. Since the validation set performance improved alongside the training accuracy, overfitting is less likely, but further testing on an independent test set would help confirm this.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

The improvement to **0.8** accuracy suggests that the modifications made to the rules in the current iteration have increased the model's predictive power. This indicates that the current rules are better at capturing the relationship between molecular structures and their corresponding loading values. However, the discrepancies identified highlight areas where the rules may still need refinement to further enhance performance.

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- **Dominant Rules in Misclassifications:**
  - *Rule 2* and *Rule 14* consistently show high positive SHAP values in cases where the loading is overestimated.
  - *Rule 2* also shows large negative SHAP values in instances where loading is underestimated.

- **Influence of Specific Rules:**
  - *Rule 3* contributes significantly to overestimations when it has a high positive SHAP value.
  - The negative impact of *Rule 14* in some molecules suggests it may be too broadly defined or may require additional conditions to improve specificity.

- **Potential Overfitting:**
  - High SHAP values for certain rules in misclassifications may indicate that the rules are too general and are capturing noise rather than the underlying signal, leading to overfitting.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to refine the current rules:

**1. Refine Rule 2:**

- **Issue:** Rule 2 is contributing to both overestimations and underestimations, indicating that it may be too broadly defined.
- **Current Rule 2:**
  - *Modifiers that are benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating substituents at the para position yield high value; those with electron-donating or non-coordinating substituents yield low value.*
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Clarify Substituent Effects:** Provide a more detailed categorization of substituents based on their electron-withdrawing abilities and coordinating potential. Consider the influence of meta and ortho positions, not just para.
  - **Incorporate Steric Factors:** Account for steric hindrance that might affect metal coordination, as bulky substituents may impede interaction despite being electron-withdrawing.
  - **Example Modification:**
    - *Modifiers that are benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO₂, -CN) at the para position and lack steric hindrance yield high value; modifiers with electron-donating groups or bulky substituents yield low value.*

**2. Adjust Rule 14:**

- **Issue:** Rule 14 is contributing negatively with high magnitude in several misclassifications, suggesting it may be penalizing certain structures too heavily.
- **Current Rule 14:**
  - *Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low value.*
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Specify Acylation Context:** Differentiate between N-acylation and O-acylation, as their effects on metal coordination can differ.
  - **Consider Adjacent Functional Groups:** Modify the rule to account for nearby functional groups that might compensate for the reduced coordination ability of acylated amino groups.
  - **Example Modification:**
    - *Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low value unless additional strong coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) are present within a two-carbon distance from the amino group.*

**3. Refine Rule 3:**

- **Issue:** Rule 3 contributes to overprediction when the amino group is within five carbons of the carboxyl group, but this may not always lead to high loading.
- **Current Rule 3:**
  - *Modifiers with amino groups located within five carbons of the carboxyl group yield high value; those with amino groups farther away or acylated yield low value.*
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Tighten Amino Group Proximity:** Reduce the distance criterion from five carbons to three carbons to ensure stronger chelation potential.
  - **Exclude Certain Configurations:** Consider excluding amino groups that are sterically hindered or involved in intramolecular interactions that reduce their availability for metal coordination.
  - **Example Modification:**
    - *Modifiers with primary or secondary amino groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group yield high value, provided they are not sterically hindered or acylated.*

**4. Generalization to Address Overfitting:**

- **Simplify Overly Complex Rules:** Ensure that rules are not too specific to certain molecules in the training set. Rules should capture general chemical principles applicable to a broad range of modifiers.
- **Incorporate Negative Examples:** When defining rules, include known low-yield modifiers that fit the rule criteria to test and adjust the rule's specificity.
- **Cross-Validate Rules:** Use cross-validation within the training set to assess the generalizability of each rule individually, adjusting as necessary.

**5. Use Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- **Identify Outliers:** Examine molecules where high SHAP values contribute to misclassification to identify any overlooked structural features.
- **Iterative Rule Refinement:** Continuously update the rules based on SHAP feedback, focusing on rules that frequently have high SHAP values in misclassifications.
- **Balance SHAP Contributions:** Aim for rules that contribute positively when appropriate but do not dominate the prediction excessively, preventing any single rule from skewing the results.

**6. Consider Additional Rules or Features:**

- **Introduce New Rules:** Based on the misclassified molecules, consider adding new rules that capture the missing chemical relationships.
- **Evaluate Interactions Between Rules:** Assess whether combinations of functional groups affect the loading differently and adjust rules to account for interactive effects.
- **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors:** Besides the current rule-based features, consider quantitative molecular descriptors (e.g., pKa, logP) that might improve predictive performance.

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules has led to an improved model accuracy of **0.8**, indicating progress in capturing the determinants of high and low modifier loading on the catalyst. However, analysis of the SHAP values and misclassifications reveals that certain rules, particularly Rules 2, 3, and 14, require refinement to enhance specificity and reduce overfitting. By implementing the recommended adjustments and continually leveraging SHAP analysis for iterative refinement, we can further improve the model's predictive accuracy and reliability.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

**Summary:**

In the latest iteration, the performance metrics of the predictive rules for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction have improved significantly. The key observations are:

- **Train Confidence Increased:** From a previous mean of approximately 0.587 to **0.702**, indicating that the rules are more reliable in predicting high yields when their conditions are met.
- **Train Lift Improved:** From a previous mean of around 1.13 to **1.40**, suggesting a stronger association between the presence of certain molecular features (as specified by the rules) and high reaction yields.
- **Validation Accuracy Enhanced:** Achieved a 5-fold cross-validation accuracy of **0.8**, showing better generalizability of the rules compared to previous accuracies ranging between 0.514 and 0.76.
- **SHAP Analysis Insights:** Identified that certain rules (notably Rules 2, 3, and 14) significantly influence the model's predictions, sometimes leading to misclassifications.

Despite these improvements, discrepancies remain where the model either overestimates or underestimates the modifier loading on the catalyst, leading to incorrect yield predictions. These discrepancies are mainly attributed to certain rules being too broad or lacking specificity.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Rule 2:**

   - **Issue:** Rule 2 contributes to both overestimations and underestimations due to its broad definition.
   - **Current Rule 2:** *Modifiers that are benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating substituents at the para position yield high value; those with electron-donating or non-coordinating substituents yield low value.*
   - **Improvement Suggestions:**
     - **Specify Strength of Substituents:** Differentiate between strong and moderate electron-withdrawing groups. For example, nitro (-NO₂) and cyano (-CN) groups are strong, while halogens are moderate.
     - **Consider Steric Hindrance:** Account for bulky substituents that may interfere with metal coordination despite being electron-withdrawing.
     - **Include Positional Effects:** Recognize that substituents in positions other than para can influence coordination differently.
   - **Refined Rule 2:** *Modifiers that are benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO₂, -CN) at the para position yield high value unless steric hindrance is significant; modifiers with electron-donating groups or bulky substituents yield low value.*

2. **Adjust Rule 3:**

   - **Issue:** The rule may overestimate high yields due to an overly generous distance criterion for amino groups.
   - **Current Rule 3:** *Modifiers with amino groups located within five carbons of the carboxyl group yield high value; those with amino groups farther away or acylated yield low value.*
   - **Improvement Suggestions:**
     - **Shorten Distance Criterion:** Limit the effective distance to within three carbons of the carboxyl group to ensure stronger chelation potential.
     - **Exclude Sterically Hindered Amino Groups:** Exclude amino groups that are hindered or involved in intramolecular interactions reducing their availability.
   - **Refined Rule 3:** *Modifiers with primary amino groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group, without steric hindrance or acylation, yield high value.*

3. **Refine Rule 14:**

   - **Issue:** Rule 14 has been overly penalizing certain modifiers, contributing to underestimations.
   - **Current Rule 14:** *Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low value.*
   - **Improvement Suggestions:**
     - **Differentiate Acylation Types:** Specify whether N-acylation (on nitrogen) or O-acylation (on oxygen) affects metal coordination differently.
     - **Consider Adjacent Functional Groups:** Account for other coordinating groups nearby that might compensate for acylation.
   - **Refined Rule 14:** *Modifiers with N-acylated amino groups yield low value unless additional strong coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) are present within two carbons of the acylated amino group.*

4. **Introduce Additional Specificity in Rules:**

   - **Add Rule on Aromatic Amino Acids:**
     - **Suggestion:** Recognize that aromatic amino acids (e.g., tryptophan, tyrosine) may yield high value due to the coordination potential of their side chains.
     - **Proposed Rule:** *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield high value due to enhanced metal coordination through the aromatic ring.*
   - **Modify Rule 5 (Thiol Groups):**
     - **Issue:** The current rule may not account for the reactivity of thiols.
     - **Improvement Suggestions:** Consider the potential for thiol groups to form disulfide bonds, which may reduce their availability for coordination.
     - **Refined Rule 5:** *Modifiers containing free thiol groups on aliphatic chains yield high value unless the thiol groups are prone to disulfide formation under reaction conditions.*

5. **Consider Synergistic Effects of Functional Groups:**

   - **Identify Synergism:** Examine whether the presence of multiple coordinating groups enhances the overall coordination potential beyond the sum of individual contributions.
   - **Adjust Rules Accordingly:** Modify existing rules or create new ones to reflect the combined effects of functional groups.
   - **Proposed Addition:** *Modifiers with multiple adjacent coordinating groups (e.g., adjacent amino and hydroxyl groups) yield higher value due to synergistic coordination effects.*

6. **Evaluate the Impact of Molecular Geometry:**

   - **Suggestion:** Incorporate considerations of molecular geometry and flexibility, as these can affect the ability of functional groups to coordinate with the metal center.
   - **Proposed Rule Modification:** *Modifiers whose coordinating groups are favorably oriented for chelation (due to molecular geometry) yield high value.*

7. **Improve Rule Definitions Based on SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Utilize SHAP Insights:** Use the SHAP values to identify which rules contribute most to misclassifications and adjust them accordingly.
   - **Decrease Overemphasis of Certain Rules:** Ensure that no single rule disproportionately influences the prediction unless strongly justified by chemical knowledge.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Yes, there is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the rules to be more specific and better aligned with chemical principles, we can enhance their predictive accuracy while maintaining generalizability. Incorporating additional details regarding functional group interactions, steric effects, and molecular geometry can help create a more nuanced rule set that captures the complexities of the reaction system.

**Please Optimize Rules**

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic acids) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**Glutamic acid**), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**Aspartic acid**).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and dual carboxyl groups allows for strong chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity, which increases the yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating substituents at the para position yield high value; those with electron-donating or non-coordinating substituents yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups like amino, nitro, and bromomethyl enhance metal binding by increasing the acidity of the carboxyl group and providing additional coordination sites. Electron-donating groups like methyl reduce metal coordination, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with amino groups located within five carbons of the carboxyl group yield high value; those with amino groups farther away or acylated yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl enhances chelation with metal centers. Distant or acylated amino groups are less effective in metal coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (**Gluconic acid**), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal ions and facilitate hydrogen bonding, enhancing metal complexation and improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing thiol (sulfhydryl) groups yield high value when the thiol is on an aliphatic chain; those with sulfur attached to aromatic rings or in thioethers yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Sulfur in aromatic systems or thioethers is less accessible for coordination due to steric hindrance or delocalization.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or form inactive complexes with metal ions, deactivating the catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: The electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination and decreasing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (**Niacin**), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as strong chelating agents with metal centers, enhancing coordination and improving catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low value unless additional strong coordinating groups are present.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weak donors for metal coordination. Without additional coordinating groups, the overall metal-binding ability is insufficient to enhance catalytic performance.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (with eight or more carbons) yield high value unless they contain interfering functional groups.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may improve substrate accessibility and stabilize the catalyst. Interfering groups (like distant amino groups) can disrupt metal coordination, reducing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups near the carboxyl group yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can chelate with metal centers in a way that competes with the active site or alters the catalyst structure, leading to decreased catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high value only when additional coordinating groups are present.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density and can enhance metal interactions when coupled with other coordinating groups. Without them, the coordination is insufficient to impact the yield positively.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached via a five-carbon aliphatic chain yield high value; those with shorter chains yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl to effectively coordinate with the metal center. Shorter chains limit this interaction due to steric constraints.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of the amino group reduces its availability for metal coordination, diminishing its ability to enhance catalyst activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing amino groups directly attached to aromatic rings yield high value; those with amino groups on aliphatic chains yield high value only when the chain is short.**
  - *High Yield Example (Aromatic Amino Group)*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**.
  - *High Yield Example (Short Aliphatic Chain)**: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example**: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale**: Aromatic amino groups enhance metal coordination due to conjugation with the ring. Aliphatic amino groups are effective when close to the carboxyl group, enabling strong chelation; distant amino groups are less effective.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2 to Specify Strength and Position of Substituents**

  - **Action**: Modify Rule 2 to differentiate between strong and moderate electron-withdrawing substituents on benzoic acids, consider steric hindrance, and include positional effects.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Revise Rule 2**:
      - **New Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are benzoic acids with **strong electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro (-NO₂), cyano (-CN)) at the para position yield high value **unless steric hindrance is significant**. Modifiers with moderate electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens) or substituents in positions other than para yield moderate to low value. Modifiers with electron-donating or bulky substituents yield low value.*
    - **Justification**: This refinement accounts for the varying effects of different substituents based on their electron-withdrawing strength and position, and it recognizes the impact of steric hindrance on metal coordination.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust Rule 3 by Shortening the Effective Distance of Amino Groups**

  - **Action**: Modify Rule 3 to limit the amino group's effective distance to within three carbons of the carboxyl group and exclude sterically hindered or acylated amino groups.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Revise Rule 3**:
      - **New Rule 3**: *Modifiers with primary amino groups located within **three carbons** of the carboxyl group and without steric hindrance or acylation yield high value. Those with amino groups farther away, sterically hindered, or acylated yield low value.*
    - **Justification**: Shortening the distance criterion enhances the likelihood of effective chelation with the metal center, improving catalyst performance. Excluding hindered or acylated amino groups prevents overestimation of yield where coordination is unlikely.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rule 14 to Differentiate Acylation Types and Consider Adjacent Groups**

  - **Action**: Update Rule 14 to distinguish between N-acylation and O-acylation and to consider the presence of additional coordinating groups nearby.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Revise Rule 14**:
      - **New Rule 14**: *Modifiers with **N-acylated amino groups** yield low value **unless** there are additional strong coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) present within **two carbons** of the acylated amino group.*
    - **Justification**: Differentiating acylation types provides clarity on how acylation affects metal coordination. Including nearby coordinating groups accounts for cases where coordination might still be effective despite acylation.

- **Advice 4**: **Introduce a New Rule for Aromatic Amino Acids**

  - **Action**: Add a new rule to account for modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains enhancing metal coordination.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Add Rule 16**:
      - **Rule 16**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with **aromatic side chains** (e.g., tryptophan, tyrosine) yield high value due to enhanced metal coordination through the aromatic ring.*
    - **Justification**: Aromatic side chains can interact with metal centers, improving catalyst efficiency, and this rule captures that effect.

- **Advice 5**: **Modify Rule 5 to Account for Thiol Reactivity and Disulfide Formation**

  - **Action**: Adjust Rule 5 to consider the potential for thiol groups to form disulfide bonds, which may reduce their availability for metal coordination.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Revise Rule 5**:
      - **New Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing free thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on aliphatic chains yield high value **unless the thiol groups are prone to disulfide formation under reaction conditions**. Modifiers with sulfur attached to aromatic rings or in thioethers yield low value.*
    - **Justification**: By acknowledging the reactivity of thiol groups, the rule more accurately predicts the availability of sulfur atoms for metal coordination.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Synergistic Effects of Multiple Coordinating Groups**

  - **Action**: Introduce a new rule or modify existing ones to consider the synergistic effect of adjacent coordinating groups enhancing metal binding.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Add Rule 17**:
      - **Rule 17**: *Modifiers with multiple **adjacent strong coordinating groups** (e.g., amino and hydroxyl groups within two atoms of each other) yield high value due to synergistic coordination effects.*
    - **Justification**: Recognizing synergism between functional groups allows for a more accurate prediction of modifiers that can strongly enhance catalyst performance.

- **Advice 7**: **Consider Molecular Geometry and Flexibility in Relevant Rules**

  - **Action**: Modify rules where the molecular geometry and flexibility of the modifier influence metal coordination, such as in Rule 13.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Revise Rule 13**:
      - **New Rule 13**: *Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached via a flexible aliphatic chain of **five or more carbons** yield high value; those with shorter or rigid chains yield low value due to limited flexibility affecting coordination.*
    - **Justification**: Incorporating molecular geometry considerations ensures that only modifiers capable of effective chelation due to their structural flexibility are predicted to yield high values.

- **Advice 8**: **Utilize SHAP Analysis to Adjust Rule Influences**

  - **Action**: Analyze SHAP values to identify rules that significantly contribute to misclassifications and adjust their definitions or weighting in the predictive model.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Evaluate Rules 2, 3, and 14**: As these rules have been identified to influence misclassifications, refine them as per Advice 1, 2, and 3.
    - **Adjust Rule Weighting**: In the predictive model, decrease the influence of rules that may be overly broad or increase the specificity in their conditions.
    - **Justification**: Fine-tuning the model based on SHAP analysis helps in reducing errors and improving the overall accuracy of predictions.

- **Advice 9**: **Update the Predictive Model to Reflect Rule Changes**

  - **Action**: Incorporate the refined and new rules into the predictive model and retrain it to evaluate the impact on performance metrics.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Model Retraining**: Input the updated rules and perform cross-validation to assess improvements in accuracy, lift, and confidence.
    - **Performance Monitoring**: Compare new metrics with previous ones to ensure that refinements lead to tangible improvements without overfitting.
    - **Justification**: Updating the model ensures that the practical changes in rules translate into better predictive capabilities.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups enhances chelation with metal ions, improving catalyst stability and reactivity, which increases the yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with amino groups yield high value; those substituted with aldehyde or formyl groups yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Para-amino groups enhance metal coordination due to lone pair availability on nitrogen, boosting catalytic performance. Aldehyde groups can deactivate catalysts by forming inactive complexes with metal ions.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with short aliphatic chains (up to five carbons) containing amino groups yield high value; longer chains or acylated amino groups yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group enhances chelation with metal centers. Distant or acylated amino groups are less effective in metal coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids yield high value.**
  - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high value; thiol groups attached to aromatic rings yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Aromatic thiols are less accessible due to resonance stabilization, reducing their coordinating ability.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can form inactive complexes with metal ions or undergo side reactions, deactivating the catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids yield high value when the nitrogen atom is adjacent to the carboxyl group (positions 2 or 3); substitution at position 4 yields low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group enhance metal binding through chelation. When the nitrogen is further away (position 4), the coordination is less effective.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups yield high value; those with interfering groups yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted long chains can improve substrate accessibility and stabilize the catalyst. Additional functional groups may interfere with metal coordination or catalyst assembly.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: The high electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal coordination and decreasing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low value unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups, such as amino groups.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weak donors for metal coordination. Without additional strong coordinating groups, the overall metal-binding ability is insufficient to enhance catalytic performance.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains of five carbons yield high value; shorter chains yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. Shorter chains limit this interaction due to steric constraints.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing acylated amino groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of the amino group reduces its nucleophilicity and availability for metal coordination, diminishing its ability to enhance catalyst activity.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings fused to nitrogen-containing heterocycles yield high value.**
  - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Rationale*: The indole nitrogen can participate in metal coordination, enhancing catalyst performance through increased binding interactions.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups near the carboxyl group can chelate with metal centers in a way that competes with the active site or alters the catalyst structure, leading to decreased catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected to carbonyl-containing side chains yield high value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatic systems can stabilize metal complexes through π-interactions, enhancing catalyst activity and yield.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and precise, enabling straightforward determination of high yield when modifiers are α-amino dicarboxylic acids. The property insight is strong, explaining that the combination of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups enhances chelation with metal ions, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. The rule considers a combination of functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by data points 0 and 2 (**(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**), both yielding high value, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly distinguishes between high yield modifiers (benzoic acids substituted at the para position with amino groups) and low yield modifiers (substituted with aldehyde or formyl groups). The property insight is adequate, explaining how para-amino groups enhance metal coordination due to lone pair availability, while aldehyde groups can deactivate catalysts by forming inactive complexes. The rule combines substitution patterns on benzoic acids, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points 4 (**4-aminobenzoic acid**, high yield) and 19 (**4-formylbenzoic acid**, low yield), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in specifying that modifiers with short aliphatic chains (up to five carbons) containing amino groups yield high value, while longer chains or acylated amino groups yield low value. The property insight explains the importance of proximity between the amino and carboxyl groups for effective chelation. The rule combines chain length and functional group presence, adding to complexity. It is supported by data points 3 (**5-aminopentanoic acid**, high yield) and 31 and 34 (**7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, low yield), fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 articulates that polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids yield high value. This is clear and allows for straightforward determination. The property insight is solid, highlighting that multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. The rule combines multiple hydroxyl groups with a carboxylic acid, adding complexity. It is supported by data points 8 and 6 (**(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**), both yielding high value, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 unambiguously states that modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high value, while those with thiol groups attached to aromatic rings yield low value. The property insight explains that aliphatic thiols are flexible and effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity, whereas aromatic thiols are less accessible due to resonance stabilization. The rule considers both the functional group and the nature of the chain, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points 17 (**3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, high yield) and 9 (**4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, low yield), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value. The property insight is acceptable, explaining that aldehyde groups can form inactive complexes with metal ions or undergo side reactions, deactivating the catalyst. The rule focuses on a specific functional group, acceptable in complexity. It is supported by data points 19 and 18 (**4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**), both yielding low value, fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 specifies that pyridine carboxylic acids yield high value when the nitrogen atom is adjacent to the carboxyl group (positions 2 or 3), and that substitution at position 4 yields low value. The property insight is adequate, explaining that nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group enhance metal binding through chelation. The rule considers the position of substitution, adding complexity. It is supported by data points 21 (**pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, high yield) and 11 (**4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 states that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups yield high value, while those with interfering groups yield low value. The property insight suggests that unsubstituted long chains improve substrate accessibility and stabilize the catalyst, which is reasonable. The rule considers chain length and functional group presence, satisfying complexity. It is supported by data point 5 (**octanoic acid**, high yield) and data point 29 (**7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, low yield), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in stating that modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains yield low value. The property insight is acceptable, discussing how the high electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal coordination. The rule focuses on a specific functional group, acceptable in complexity. However, it is supported by only one data point (data point 13, **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, low yield), indicating limited coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that modifiers with ether linkages yield low value unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups, such as amino groups. The clarity is acceptable, though the exception adds slight complexity. The property insight explains that ether oxygen atoms are weak donors, and without additional strong coordinating groups, the metal-binding ability is insufficient. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, adding complexity. It is supported by data point 10 (**2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, low yield), but only one data point directly supports the rule, limiting coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 specifies that modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains of five carbons yield high value, while shorter chains yield low value. The property insight suggests that longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. The rule combines chain length with functional group presence, adding complexity. It is supported by data points 7 (**5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**, high yield) and 30 (**3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear in stating that modifiers containing acylated amino groups yield low value. The property insight explains that acylation reduces the nucleophilicity and availability of amino groups for metal coordination, diminishing catalytic activity. The rule focuses on a specific functional group modification. It is supported by data points 33 (**(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**) and 23 (**2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**), both yielding low value, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly states that modifiers with aromatic rings fused to nitrogen-containing heterocycles yield high value. The property insight mentions that the indole nitrogen can participate in metal coordination, enhancing catalyst performance through increased binding interactions. The rule combines specific structural features, adding complexity. It is supported by data point 14 (**(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**, high yield), but only one data point supports the rule, limiting coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 states that modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group yield low value. The property insight explains that such keto groups can chelate with metal centers in a way that competes with the active site or alters the catalyst structure, reducing catalytic efficiency. The rule considers specific functional group placement, adding complexity. It is supported by data point 27 (**4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, low yield), but only one data point supports the rule, indicating limited coverage.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 specifies that modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected to carbonyl-containing side chains yield high value. The property insight explains that electron-rich aromatic systems can stabilize metal complexes through π-interactions, enhancing catalyst activity and yield. The rule combines multiple structural features, adding complexity. It is supported by data points 16 (**1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**) and 25 (**4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**), both yielding high value, satisfying the coverage criterion.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high value.**
  - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups enhances chelation with metal ions, improving catalyst stability and reactivity, which increases the yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with amino groups yield high value; those substituted with aldehyde or formyl groups yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Para-amino groups enhance metal coordination due to lone pair availability on nitrogen, boosting catalytic performance. Aldehyde groups can deactivate catalysts by forming inactive complexes with metal ions.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with short aliphatic chains (up to five carbons) containing amino groups yield high value; longer chains or acylated amino groups yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group enhances chelation with metal centers. Distant or acylated amino groups are less effective in metal coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids yield high value.**
  - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high value; thiol groups attached to aromatic rings yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Aromatic thiols are less accessible due to resonance stabilization, reducing their coordinating ability.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low value.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can form inactive complexes with metal ions or undergo side reactions, deactivating the catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids yield high value when the nitrogen atom is adjacent to the carboxyl group (positions 2 or 3); substitution at position 4 yields low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group enhance metal binding through chelation. When the nitrogen is further away (position 4), the coordination is less effective.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups yield high value; those with interfering groups yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted long chains can improve substrate accessibility and stabilize the catalyst. Additional functional groups may interfere with metal coordination or catalyst assembly.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: The high electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal coordination and decreasing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low value unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups, such as amino groups.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weak donors for metal coordination. Without additional strong coordinating groups, the overall metal-binding ability is insufficient to enhance catalytic performance.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains of five carbons yield high value; shorter chains yield low value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. Shorter chains limit this interaction due to steric constraints.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing acylated amino groups yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of the amino group reduces its nucleophilicity and availability for metal coordination, diminishing its ability to enhance catalyst activity.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings fused to nitrogen-containing heterocycles yield high value.**
  - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Rationale*: The indole nitrogen can participate in metal coordination, enhancing catalyst performance through increased binding interactions.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with keto (carbonyl) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups near the carboxyl group can chelate with metal centers in a way that competes with the active site or alters the catalyst structure, leading to decreased catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected to carbonyl-containing side chains yield high value.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatic systems can stabilize metal complexes through π-interactions, enhancing catalyst activity and yield.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Relax the SMARTS patterns for Rule 1 to account for stereochemistry and variability in side chains.** The current SMARTS pattern for `alpha_amino_acid` may be too restrictive and does not account for stereochemistry or different side chains. Modify the pattern to `'[NX3][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,O-]'` to include all alpha amino acids regardless of stereochemistry or side chain variations.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Adjust SMARTS patterns to be less specific and more inclusive for Rules involving aromatic substitutions (e.g., Rule 2).** Replace specific patterns like `para_amino_benzoic_acid` with a more general pattern that captures any para-substituted amino benzoic acids. For example, use `'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)[OX1H1,O-]'` and then check for amino groups at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Incorporate stereochemistry-agnostic matching in SMARTS patterns.** For molecules where stereochemistry is present in SMILES (e.g., '@' symbols), configure the matching functions to ignore stereochemistry by setting `useChirality=False` in `HasSubstructMatch`.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Expand the patterns for aliphatic chains in Rule 3 to include variable chain lengths up to five carbons.** Modify the SMARTS pattern for `short_chain_amino` to `'[NX3H2][CH2]{1,4}[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,O-]'` to match chains of varying lengths up to five carbons.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Ensure count thresholds are correctly associated with the right SMARTS patterns.** In Rule 1 and Rule 4, make sure that the `count_threshold` keys correspond to the `GetSmarts()` of the compiled patterns, not the original SMARTS strings. Update the `count_threshold` keys to use the patterns themselves or their indices.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Check that the exclude patterns are effectively preventing matches when intended.** For rules with `exclude_patterns`, verify that the logic correctly skips the rule when exclude patterns are present. Ensure that the loop over exclude patterns breaks appropriately upon finding a match.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Use comprehensive SMARTS patterns for functional groups.** Review and possibly redefine the SMARTS patterns for functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, and ethers to ensure they match all possible variants described in the rules.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Add additional logic to account for overlapping functional groups and multifaceted rules.** Some rules require both the presence and absence of certain groups. Structure the code to handle complex logical conditions, perhaps by setting up more detailed conditional statements.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Implement unit tests for each rule with known compounds.** Create a set of test SMILES strings for which the expected rule application is known. Test the code against these to ensure that each rule correctly identifies matches and non-matches.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.** Break down complex functions into smaller, modular functions. This will make it easier to debug and update specific parts of the code related to individual rules.

**End of Suggestions**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Descriptors**
  - Reformulate the current rules to focus on quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. Replace qualitative terms like "enhances chelation" or "improves coordination" with specific, measurable features such as the count of particular atoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur), functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl), or structural motifs (e.g., aromatic rings, aliphatic chains of specific lengths).

- **Advice 2**: **Use SMARTS Patterns for Functional Group Identification**
  - Define the functional groups and substructures mentioned in the rules using SMARTS notation. This allows for the automated identification of these features in SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools. For example, specify SMARTS patterns for α-amino acids, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, thiols, and other relevant groups to create a binary feature matrix indicating their presence or absence.

- **Advice 3**: **Simplify and Generalize Chain Length Criteria**
  - Standardize the rules related to chain lengths by specifying exact ranges that can be numerically evaluated. For instance, modify rules to state "Modifiers with aliphatic chains of length 3 to 5 carbons containing an amino group yield high value," which can be directly assessed by calculating chain lengths from the SMILES.

- **Advice 4**: **Convert Structural Characteristics into Numerical Features**
  - Quantify structural features such as the number of rings, ring sizes, degree of unsaturation, and the presence of heteroatoms. Incorporate these as numerical features in the dataset, making it easier to correlate them with the yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Employ Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints**
  - Utilize molecular descriptors like molecular weight, LogP, topological polar surface area (TPSA), and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor counts. Generate molecular fingerprints (e.g., ECFP, MACCS keys) to capture structural information numerically. These can be computed directly from SMILES and used to create feature matrices.

- **Advice 6**: **Rephrase Rules to Align with Computable Properties**
  - Adjust the language of the rules to align with properties that can be calculated. For example, instead of "Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems yield high value," specify "Modifiers containing aromatic rings with electron-donating substituents (e.g., hydroxyl, amino groups) at ortho or para positions yield high value."

- **Advice 7**: **Create a Hierarchical Feature Extraction Framework**
  - Develop a tiered approach where primary features (functional groups, atom counts) feed into secondary features (coordination ability, electronic effects). This helps bridge the gap between raw computable data and the underlying chemical rationale.

- **Advice 8**: **Provide Examples with Computational Methods**
  - Include examples demonstrating how to extract each feature from SMILES using cheminformatics libraries like RDKit. For instance:
    - Counting amino groups: Use `Chem.MolFromSmiles()` to parse SMILES and `mol.GetSubstructMatches()` with the SMARTS pattern '[NX3;H2]'.
    - Determining aliphatic chain length: Analyze paths in the molecular graph consisting of sp³-hybridized carbons.

- **Advice 9**: **Integrate Electronically Relevant Descriptors**
  - Since electronic effects influence yield, incorporate descriptors like partial charges, HOMO-LUMO gaps, or electrophilicity indices if computational resources permit. Although more complex, these can provide valuable insights and are calculable from molecular structures.

- **Advice 10**: **Standardize Nomenclature and Structural Representation**
  - Ensure all modifiers are represented consistently, using canonical SMILES. This avoids discrepancies in feature calculation due to differing representations of the same molecule.

- **Advice 11**: **Validate and Update Rules with Statistical Analysis**
  - Use statistical methods (e.g., correlation analysis, decision trees) to identify which features most strongly correlate with high or low yields. Refine rules based on these findings to improve their predictive power and alignment with computable features.

- **Advice 12**: **Consider the Feasibility of Feature Extraction**
  - Prioritize features that are straightforward to extract and have minimal computational overhead. Avoid relying on complex structural motifs that are difficult to define or compute from SMILES.

  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance metal-ligand interactions by increasing electrophilicity, facilitating catalyst activity. Electron-donating groups decrease this effect.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with short aliphatic chains (up to five carbons) containing amino groups yield high value; longer chains or acylated amino groups yield low value.**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains yield low value.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: The high electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal coordination and decreasing catalytic activity.

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Structural Features for Numerical Representation**

  Modify the rules to specify exact numerical parameters for structural features. For example, instead of saying "short aliphatic chains (up to five carbons)", specify "aliphatic chains with a carbon count ≤ 5". This allows for direct calculation of features like chain length from SMILES strings.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate and Standardize Functional Group Definitions**

  Create a standardized list of functional groups with clear definitions that can be identified using SMARTS patterns. This will enable automatic detection of groups such as amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, thiol, and others from SMILES, facilitating numerical encoding.

- **Advice 3**: **Use Quantitative Descriptors for Electronic Effects**

  Replace qualitative terms like "electron-withdrawing" or "electron-donating" groups with quantifiable electronic parameters. Utilize Hammett sigma constants or Pike's inductive constants to assign numerical values to substituents, allowing for precise calculation of electronic effects.

- **Advice 4**: **Implement Molecular Descriptors Calculable from SMILES**

  Integrate widely-used molecular descriptors into the rules, such as:
  - **LogP**: Measures hydrophobicity.
  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**: Indicates hydrogen bonding capacity.
  - **Molar Refractivity**: Relates to the molecule's polarizability.
  - **Aromatic Ring Count**: Number of aromatic systems in the molecule.
  These descriptors can be computed directly from SMILES and included in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 5**: **Assign Numerical Values to Coordination Ability**

  Evaluate and assign numerical scores to the coordinating ability of functional groups based on their denticity and binding strength. For example, carboxylate groups might score higher than ether oxygens. This quantification enables better prediction of a modifier's impact on catalyst performance.

- **Advice 6**: **Create Binary Features for Presence of Key Functional Groups**

  For each modifier, generate binary features indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of specific functional groups or structural motifs identified as important in the rules. This simplifies the feature matrix and makes it suitable for machine learning models.

- **Advice 7**: **Quantify Steric Effects**

  Introduce steric parameters such as Taft steric constants or calculate the Van der Waals volume of substituents. This allows for numerical assessment of how bulky groups may influence coordination and catalyst activity.

- **Advice 8**: **Refine Rules into Conditional Statements with Measurable Criteria**

  Transform each rule into conditional if-then statements using measurable criteria. For example:
  - *If* the modifier has an amino group within three bonds of a carboxyl group, *then* it is likely to yield a high value.
  This clarity aids in programming algorithms to evaluate each modifier against the rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Multivariate Analysis of Features**

  Recognize that multiple features may interact to influence yield. Use statistical or machine learning methods to analyze how combinations of numerical features correlate with high or low yields, leading to more nuanced rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Update Rules Based on Data Trends**

  Utilize the provided dataset to statistically validate the existing rules. Identify any inconsistencies or outliers where the rules do not accurately predict the yield outcome. Update the rules accordingly to improve their predictive power.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been carefully formulated to illustrate direct combinations of substructures (functional groups) in the modifiers and their impact on the reaction yield. They consider underlying physicochemical properties such as metal coordination ability, chain length, and electronic effects. Each rule clearly predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad range of the dataset, balancing simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., Rules 1 and 2) and more complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., Rules 11 and 15). This ensures that the majority of the modifiers in the dataset are accounted for.

- **Abandoned and Revised Rules**: Some of the original rules were revised or replaced to better fit the data and underlying chemistry. For example, Rule 2 was adjusted to focus on the coordination ability of substituents rather than their electron-withdrawing or donating nature, which better explains the observed yields.

- **Combination of Functional Groups**: Several rules combine multiple substructures to predict the yield effectively. For instance, Rule 7 considers both ether linkages and the presence of additional coordinating groups like hydroxyls.

By following these rules, predictions can be made about the expected yield of the reaction for any given modifier based on its structural features.

The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 effectively differentiates between high and low yield modifiers based on the nature of substituents on para-substituted benzoic acids. The rule is clear and offers detailed property insight into how coordinating substituents enhance metal-ligand interactions. It addresses combinations of substructures, adding to its complexity. Multiple data points support the rule, providing strong coverage. The complexity is justified, achieving a good balance.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly states that short-chain aliphatic modifiers with coordinating groups yield high yield, while longer chains or distal functional groups yield low yield. The property insight is sound, explaining the role of chain length and coordinating groups in metal interaction. The rule's complexity arises from considering both chain length and functional groups. It is supported by several data points, ensuring good coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in identifying that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups yield high yield. The property insight regarding multiple coordination sites is logical. However, the rule is only supported by one data point (gluconic acid), which limits its coverage and reduces confidence in its general applicability. The simplicity of the rule is good, but the lack of data points affects its overall strength.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic thiol modifiers regarding their yield outcomes. The property insight correctly explains the accessibility and coordinating ability of aliphatic thiols over aromatic thiols. The rule combines substructures (thiol groups on different chains), adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two data points, providing good coverage. The balance between specificity and coverage is well-achieved.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and straightforward, stating that modifiers containing aldehyde groups yield low yield. The property insight is adequate, highlighting the potential formation of inactive complexes or side reactions. The rule is simple and is supported by two data points, ensuring sufficient coverage. The simplicity and coverage provide a good balance.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 addresses the generally low yield of modifiers with ether linkages unless compensated by strong coordinating groups. The rule is clear but complex due to the exceptions. The property insight is reasonable, explaining the weakness of ether oxygen as a donor. It is supported by both low yield examples and a high-yield exception, offering good coverage. The complexity is necessary to account for exceptions, and the balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly states that perfluorinated alkyl chain modifiers yield low yield. The property insight is sound, based on the electronegativity of fluorine reducing coordination ability. However, the rule is supported by only one data point, limiting its coverage and reliability. While the simplicity is advantageous, the lack of data affects the rule's strength.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 effectively differentiates yield based on the presence of coordinating heteroatoms in aromatic side chains of amino acids. The rule is clear and provides good property insight into metal binding capabilities. It combines substructures, adding complexity appropriately. Supported by data points for both high and low yield, the rule has good coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly stipulates the importance of the position of nitrogen-containing heterocycles in modifiers. The property insight is logical, explaining enhanced metal binding through chelation when adjacent to the carboxyl group. The rule has moderate complexity and is supported by multiple data points, ensuring good coverage. The balance between specificity and applicability is achieved effectively.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 lacks clarity due to vague terms like "electron-rich aromatic systems," making it difficult to apply universally. The property insight is speculative without precise definitions. With only one supporting data point, the coverage is insufficient. The rule's complexity is high but not justified due to limited applicability. Overall, the rule needs refinement for better clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear in stating that acylated amino groups lead to low yield. The property insight is logical, noting reduced nucleophilicity and coordination ability. However, the rule is supported by only one data point, limiting its coverage. While the simplicity is positive, the lack of sufficient data points affects the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly differentiates yield outcomes based on the chain length of aliphatic chains with phenolic hydroxyl groups. The property insight is plausible, explaining how chain length affects flexibility and coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures, adding necessary complexity.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Generalize the Rules into Quantifiable Molecular Descriptors**

  The current rules are specific and cover various substructures, making it challenging to generate a numeric feature matrix. Simplify the rules by identifying common molecular descriptors that can be quantitatively calculated from SMILES representations. Focus on properties like:

  - **Number of Coordination Sites**: Count the total number of potential metal-coordinating atoms (e.g., O, N, S) in the molecule.
  - **Chain Length**: Use the length of aliphatic chains as a numerical value.
  - **Aromatic vs. Aliphatic Content**: Quantify the proportion of aromatic rings versus aliphatic chains.
  - **Presence of Functional Groups**: Create binary features for the presence of functional groups like amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, thiol, aldehyde, nitro groups, etc.
  - **Electron Donating/Withdrawing Properties**: Use Hammett sigma constants or calculate electrostatic properties to quantify electronic effects.

- **Advice 2**: **Create a Feature Matrix Using Computational Molecular Descriptors**

  Utilize cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit) to compute molecular descriptors that capture the properties influencing the yield. Features to consider include:

  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**: Indicates the molecule's ability to participate in hydrogen bonding.
  - **Molecular Weight**: May correlate with steric effects.
  - **LogP (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient)**: Provides insight into hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity.
  - **Lipinski's Rule of Five Parameters**: Total hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.
  - **Partial Charges**: Average and maximum partial charges on coordinating atoms.

- **Advice 3**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules into Unified Guidelines**

  Combine rules that have similar underlying principles to reduce redundancy and complexity. For example:

  - **Metal Coordination Ability**: Merge rules concerning the presence of coordinating groups (e.g., rules about amino acids, thiols, polyhydroxylated acids) into a single rule focusing on the overall coordination potential of the modifier.
  - **Chain Length Effects**: Consolidate rules around chain length, emphasizing that there is an optimal range for chain lengths that balance flexibility and steric hindrance.

- **Advice 4**: **Reframe Rules Based on Measurable Properties**

  Instead of categorical rules, rephrase them to depend on measurable physicochemical properties:

  - **Rule Example**: "Modifiers with a polar surface area between X and Y Å² tend to yield high yields."
  - This approach allows for numerical thresholds that can be directly applied in data analysis.

- **Advice 5**: **Employ Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Models**

  Use statistical or machine learning models to correlate the calculated molecular descriptors with the reaction yield. This approach can handle complex interactions between features and provide predictive insights.

- **Advice 6**: **Use Hierarchical Classification of Functional Groups**

  Establish a hierarchy of functional groups based on their coordinating strength with the metal center:

  - **Strong Coordinators**: Amino, carboxylate, hydroxyl groups.
  - **Moderate Coordinators**: Thiol, nitro groups.
  - **Weak Coordinators or Deactivators**: Aldehydes, ethers, perfluorinated chains.

  Assign numerical values or rankings to these groups to include in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Electronic Effects Numerically**

  Calculate parameters that reflect electron-donating or -withdrawing effects:

  - **Hammett Sigma Constants**: For substituents on aromatic rings, use sigma constants to quantify electronic effects.
  - **Computational Chemistry Methods**: Use software to calculate molecular orbital energies or electron density distributions.

- **Advice 8**: **Automate Feature Extraction from SMILES**

  Develop or use existing tools to automatically parse SMILES strings and extract relevant features:

  - **Substructure Counts**: Number of specific functional groups or rings.
  - **Molecular Framework Analysis**: Identify and quantify scaffolds and linkers.

- **Advice 9**: **Provide Clear Definitions and Thresholds for Features**

  Set clear numerical thresholds for features where applicable:

  - **Chain Length Threshold**: Specify the exact number of carbons that define 'short' versus 'long' chains.
  - **Coordination Number Cut-off**: Determine the minimum number of coordinating atoms required for a high yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Rules with Statistical Analysis**

  Use the dataset to statistically validate the new, simplified rules:

  - Perform correlation analysis between features and yield.
  - Use cross-validation to assess the predictive power of the features.

**End of Advice**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows for effective chelation with metal ions (such as Fe³⁺), enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. This strong coordination increases the catalyst's efficiency, leading to a higher yield of the reaction.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with substituents capable of strong metal coordination (e.g., amino, nitro groups) yield high yield; those with non-coordinating or electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., methyl, formyl, thiol groups) yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Substituents like amino and nitro groups can donate electron density or coordinate directly with metal centers, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and improving catalytic activity. In contrast, substituents like methyl or formyl groups are non-coordinating and may withdraw electron density from the ring, reducing the ability of the modifier to stabilize the metal catalyst, resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with short aliphatic chains (up to eight carbons) yield high yield if they contain coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups) near the carboxyl end; chains longer than eight carbons or with distal functional groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **octanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Short-chain modifiers with coordinating groups near the carboxyl group can effectively interact with metal centers due to proximity, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity. Simple fatty acids like octanoic acid may increase the hydrophobic environment around the catalyst, improving its performance. Longer chains with functional groups far from the carboxyl group have reduced coordination ability due to steric hindrance and decreased interaction with the metal center, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, especially polyhydroxylated acids, yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination.**
  - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal ions, significantly enhancing metal-ligand interactions. This strong chelation stabilizes the metal catalyst, improving its reactivity and leading to higher yields in the reaction.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yield; thiol groups attached to aromatic rings yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and can effectively coordinate with metal centers through the sulfur atom, forming strong metal-thiol bonds that enhance catalyst performance. In contrast, thiol groups attached to aromatic rings are less available for coordination due to the rigidity of the ring and possible resonance delocalization of the sulfur's lone pair, reducing their coordinating ability and resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential deactivation of the catalyst.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with metal ions or amino groups in the catalyst system, forming Schiff bases or other inactive complexes. This side reaction depletes the active catalyst species and deactivates the catalyst, leading to lower yields in the target reaction.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low yield unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups like multiple hydroxyl or amino groups.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *High Yield Exception*: **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are relatively weak ligands for metal coordination due to their lone pairs being delocalized over adjacent atoms. Modifiers with ether linkages generally do not enhance catalyst performance unless they include additional strong coordinating groups (e.g., multiple hydroxyl groups) that can compensate by providing effective metal-binding sites.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing highly electronegative or electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains) yield low yield.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electron density to the metal center. This results in poor metal-ligand interactions, decreasing catalytic activity and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield low yield unless the aromatic ring contains an additional heteroatom capable of coordination.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms (like in phenylalanine) do not provide additional coordination sites for metal ions and thus do not enhance the catalyst's performance. In contrast, heteroaromatic rings (like the indole ring in tryptophan) contain nitrogen atoms that can coordinate with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high yield; if the nitrogen-containing ring is not directly attached, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: When nitrogen-containing heterocycles are adjacent to the carboxyl group, they can form chelating bidentate ligands with metal ions, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity. If the heterocycle is separated by additional rings or linkers, this chelation is hindered, reducing the modifier's ability to stabilize the metal catalyst and decreasing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing acylated amino groups (e.g., amide linkages) yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation converts amino groups into amides, which are poor ligands for metal coordination due to resonance delocalization of the lone pair on nitrogen. This decreases the modifier's ability to interact with and stabilize the metal catalyst, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains of five carbons yield high yield; shorter chains with phenolic groups yield low yield due to steric constraints.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. Shorter chains limit the mobility of the phenolic group, hindering effective coordination due to steric constraints and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected to carbonyl-containing side chains yield high yield due to enhanced metal interactions.**
  - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatic systems can engage in π-backbonding and coordinate with metal centers through their delocalized π-electron systems. When connected to carbonyl-containing side chains, these modifiers can stabilize the metal catalyst through multiple coordination modes, improving its reactivity and leading to higher yields.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been formulated to accurately describe the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yield. They consider combinations of functional groups and structural motifs, such as the presence of coordinating atoms (nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur), the position and type of substituents on aromatic rings, chain length, and electron-donating or -withdrawing effects. By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on its structure.

The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity. They combine multiple substructures when necessary to reflect the underlying physicochemical properties that influence catalyst performance, such as metal coordination ability, steric factors, and electronic effects. This approach ensures that the rules are comprehensive and can be effectively applied to a wide range of modifiers within the dataset.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in specifying that amino acids with aromatic side chains yield low yield unless the aromatic ring contains an additional coordinating heteroatom. The physical-chemical insight is sound, explaining the impact of heteroatoms on coordination. The rule combines amino acid structure and side-chain functionality, adding complexity. Coverage is present but limited to one low yield example (phenylalanine) and one high yield example (tryptophan), which may not be sufficient for robust support.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly differentiates modifiers based on the attachment of nitrogen-containing heterocycles to the carboxyl group. The rationale provides solid physical-chemical insight into chelation effects. The rule considers both structural positioning and functional groups, adding appropriate complexity.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear in stating that modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low yield. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, discussing the reduced coordination ability due to amide formation. The rule is straightforward with low complexity. Coverage is minimal, supported by a single data point ((2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), which weakens its overall support.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 specifies that modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on five-carbon aliphatic chains yield high yield, while shorter chains yield low yield due to steric constraints. Clarity is moderate, as the specific chain length requirement may cause confusion. The physical-chemical rationale is acceptable. The rule combines chain length with functional group positioning, adding complexity. Coverage is limited to one high yield example and one low yield example, which may not sufficiently support the rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected to carbonyl-containing side chains yield high yield. The clarity is moderate; the rule may be somewhat general without specific structural guidance. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable, focusing on enhanced metal interactions.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows for effective chelation with metal ions (such as Fe³⁺), enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. This strong coordination increases the catalyst's efficiency, leading to a higher yield of the reaction.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with substituents capable of strong metal coordination (e.g., amino, nitro groups) yield high yield; those with non-coordinating or electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., methyl, formyl, thiol groups) yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Substituents like amino and nitro groups can donate electron density or coordinate directly with metal centers, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and improving catalytic activity. In contrast, substituents like methyl or formyl groups are non-coordinating and may withdraw electron density from the ring, reducing the ability of the modifier to stabilize the metal catalyst, resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with short aliphatic chains (up to eight carbons) yield high yield if they contain coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups) near the carboxyl end; chains longer than eight carbons or with distal functional groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **octanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Short-chain modifiers with coordinating groups near the carboxyl group can effectively interact with metal centers due to proximity, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity. Simple fatty acids like octanoic acid may increase the hydrophobic environment around the catalyst, improving its performance. Longer chains with functional groups far from the carboxyl group have reduced coordination ability due to steric hindrance and decreased interaction with the metal center, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, especially polyhydroxylated acids, yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination.**
  - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal ions, significantly enhancing metal-ligand interactions. This strong chelation stabilizes the metal catalyst, improving its reactivity and leading to higher yields in the reaction.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yield; thiol groups attached to aromatic rings yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and can effectively coordinate with metal centers through the sulfur atom, forming strong metal-thiol bonds that enhance catalyst performance. In contrast, thiol groups attached to aromatic rings are less available for coordination due to the rigidity of the ring and possible resonance delocalization of the sulfur's lone pair, reducing their coordinating ability and resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential deactivation of the catalyst.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with metal ions or amino groups in the catalyst system, forming Schiff bases or other inactive complexes. This side reaction depletes the active catalyst species and deactivates the catalyst, leading to lower yields in the target reaction.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low yield unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups like multiple hydroxyl or amino groups.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *High Yield Exception*: **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are relatively weak ligands for metal coordination due to their lone pairs being delocalized over adjacent atoms. Modifiers with ether linkages generally do not enhance catalyst performance unless they include additional strong coordinating groups (e.g., multiple hydroxyl groups) that can compensate by providing effective metal-binding sites.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing highly electronegative or electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains) yield low yield.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electron density to the metal center. This results in poor metal-ligand interactions, decreasing catalytic activity and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield low yield unless the aromatic ring contains an additional heteroatom capable of coordination.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms (like in phenylalanine) do not provide additional coordination sites for metal ions and thus do not enhance the catalyst's performance. In contrast, heteroaromatic rings (like the indole ring in tryptophan) contain nitrogen atoms that can coordinate with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high yield; if the nitrogen-containing ring is not directly attached, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: When nitrogen-containing heterocycles are adjacent to the carboxyl group, they can form chelating bidentate ligands with metal ions, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity. If the heterocycle is separated by additional rings or linkers, this chelation is hindered, reducing the modifier's ability to stabilize the metal catalyst and decreasing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing acylated amino groups (e.g., amide linkages) yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation converts amino groups into amides, which are poor ligands for metal coordination due to resonance delocalization of the lone pair on nitrogen. This decreases the modifier's ability to interact with and stabilize the metal catalyst, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains of five carbons yield high yield; shorter chains with phenolic groups yield low yield due to steric constraints.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. Shorter chains limit the mobility of the phenolic group, hindering effective coordination due to steric constraints and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected to carbonyl-containing side chains yield high yield due to enhanced metal interactions.**
  - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatic systems can engage in π-backbonding and coordinate with metal centers through their delocalized π-electron systems. When connected to carbonyl-containing side chains, these modifiers can stabilize the metal catalyst through multiple coordination modes, improving its reactivity and leading to higher yields.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been formulated to accurately describe the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yield. They consider combinations of functional groups and structural motifs, such as the presence of coordinating atoms (nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur), the position and type of substituents on aromatic rings, chain length, and electron-donating or -withdrawing effects. By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on its structure.

The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity. They combine multiple substructures when necessary to reflect the underlying physicochemical properties that influence catalyst performance, such as metal coordination ability, steric factors, and electronic effects. This approach ensures that the rules are comprehensive and can be effectively applied to a wide range of modifiers within the dataset.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Revise the SMARTS pattern for α-amino acids in **Rule 1** to correctly match α-amino dicarboxylic acids. The current pattern `'[NX3;H2]-[CX4H]-[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` may not capture all α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups (e.g., glutamic acid and aspartic acid). Consider updating the pattern to account for side chains and additional carboxylic acid groups. A more accurate pattern could be `'[NX3;H2]-[CX4H](-[CX3](=O)[OX1H1])-[#6]'` combined with an extra condition to check for at least two carboxylic acid groups in the molecule.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Adjust the **Rule 4** implementation to correctly identify polyhydroxylated acids. Ensure that the counting of hydroxyl groups excludes the hydroxyl oxygen in carboxylic acid functionalities, as these are part of the carboxyl group, not separate hydroxyl groups. Modify the code to count only free hydroxyl groups (`'[OX2H]'`) not directly attached to a carbonyl carbon.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Update the code for **Rule 9** to accurately detect amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms. The current implementation may not identify compounds like phenylalanine. Modify the conditions to ensure the molecule matches both an α-amino acid pattern and contains an aromatic ring without nitrogen or other coordinating heteroatoms. Adjust the exclude patterns to comprehensively cover aromatic rings with potential coordinating atoms.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For all rules, review and refine the SMARTS patterns to ensure they accurately reflect the structural descriptions in the natural language rules. Verify that each pattern matches the intended substructures and functional groups. Add comments or documentation to clarify the purpose of each pattern, facilitating future maintenance and updates.

---

**Performance Evaluation**

The increase in **confidence** and **lift** values suggests that the current rules are more effective at predicting high yields when their conditions are met. However, the decrease in **support** indicates that these rules apply to fewer cases.

- **Strengths:**
  - **High Confidence:** Indicates that when the rule conditions are satisfied, there is a high probability of achieving a high yield.
  - **High Lift:** Demonstrates a strong association between the rule conditions and high yields, exceeding random chance.

- **Weaknesses:**
  - **Low Support:** The rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset, which may limit their utility in practical applications.
  - **Rule 2 Analysis:** With a confidence of **0.5000** and a lift of **1.0000**, **Rule 2** does not provide predictive value beyond random chance.

---

**Determining if a Local Minimum Has Been Reached**

The progression of metrics indicates improvements in **confidence** and **lift**, while **support** has decreased. This suggests that the rules have become more precise but less general.

- **Local Minimum Assessment:**
  - The current set of rules may not represent a local minimum because there is an imbalance between confidence/lift and support.
  - The low support values imply that potential improvements could be made to increase the applicability of the rules without significantly compromising confidence and lift.

- **Iteration Adequacy:**
  - Given the observed trends, further iterations are warranted to enhance the rules' coverage while maintaining or improving their predictive strength.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Enhance Rule Support**

   - **Objective:** Increase the proportion of the dataset that the rules apply to.
   - **Strategies:**
     - **Generalize Conditions:** Broaden the rule conditions to include more modifiers without sacrificing significant confidence.
     - **Combine Similar Rules:** Identify common patterns among high-yield modifiers to create more inclusive rules.

2. **Refine Underperforming Rules**

   - **Rule 2 Improvement:**
     - Since **Rule 2** has a lift of **1.0000**, it does not improve predictive capability.
     - **Action Plan:**
       - Re-evaluate the structural features included in Rule 2.
       - Consider splitting the rule into separate rules for high yield and low yield modifiers to increase specificity.
       - Investigate additional functional groups or substituents that may influence yield.

3. **Balance Specificity and Generality**

   - **Maintain High Confidence:**
     - While increasing support, ensure that confidence remains high to retain predictive reliability.
   - **Avoid Overfitting:**
     - Be cautious of making rules too specific to the training data, which may reduce their effectiveness on new data.

4. **Incorporate Additional Data Analysis**

   - **Explore Correlations:**
     - Perform statistical analyses to identify other molecular descriptors correlated with high yield.
   - **Use Machine Learning Techniques:**
     - Employ methods like decision trees or random forests to uncover complex patterns not captured by current rules.

5. **Validate with Test Data**

   - **Assess Generalizability:**
     - Apply the rules to a test dataset to evaluate their performance on unseen data.
     - **Metrics to Monitor:**
       - Test confidence and lift should be evaluated to ensure the rules maintain their predictive power.

6. **Iterative Refinement**

   - **Continuous Improvement:**
     - Use insights from each iteration to refine the rules incrementally.
     - **Monitoring Metrics:**
       - Track changes in all metrics to assess the impact of modifications.

---

**Specific Suggestions for Rule Refinement**

- **Rule 1 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids):**

  - **Observation:** High confidence and lift, but low support.
  - **Improvement:**
    - Investigate the inclusion of similar amino acids or derivatives to increase support.
    - Explore adjacent functional groups that may also contribute to high yields.

- **Rule 3 (Short Aliphatic Chains with Coordinating Groups):**

  - **Observation:** Moderate support with high confidence and lift.
  - **Improvement:**
    - Consider extending the chain length criteria slightly to capture more modifiers.
    - Analyze whether modifiers with medium-length chains also exhibit high yields when certain conditions are met.

- **Rule 4 (Multiple Hydroxyl Groups):**

  - **Observation:** Highest support among current rules with strong performance.
  - **Improvement:**
    - Examine if this rule can be expanded to include modifiers with similar polyfunctional groups (e.g., polyamines).
    - Validate whether dihydroxyl or trihydroxylated acids also result in high yields.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules exhibit improved **confidence** and **lift**, indicating stronger predictive capability for high-yield outcomes when the rule conditions are met. However, the decreased **support** highlights a limitation in the applicability of these rules across the entire dataset.

To enhance the performance of the rules:

- **Increase Support:** Broaden the rules to cover more modifiers while maintaining high confidence.
- **Refine Rules with Low Predictive Value:** Reassess rules like **Rule 2** to enhance their usefulness.
- **Balance Specificity and Generality:** Ensure rules are neither too narrow nor too broad.
- **Continue Iterations:** Further iterations and refinements are necessary to achieve an optimal balance.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be improved to provide reliable predictions across a wider range of modifiers, enhancing their practical utility in catalyst design and optimization.

---

**Next Steps**

- **Data Analysis:**
  - Perform a quantitative analysis of modifiers not covered by current rules to identify potential patterns.
- **Collaboration:**
  - Engage with other researchers to gain insights and validate proposed changes.
- **Documentation:**
  - Keep detailed records of changes and their impacts on metrics to inform future iterations.

**Final Remark**

The goal is to develop a robust set of rules that not only predict high yields with high confidence but also apply to a substantial portion of the dataset. Continued iterative refinement, guided by thorough analysis of performance metrics, will lead to more effective and comprehensive predictive models.

**Analysis of Current Model Performance and Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Evaluation of Effectiveness**

The current iteration of our classification model achieved a **5-fold validation accuracy of 65.71%**, which is an improvement over some previous iterations but not the highest we've observed. Comparing the accuracies:

- **Previous Accuracies for Reference:**
  - 76%, 76%, 76%, 76%, 76%, 76%; Test Accuracy: 75%
  - 76%, 68%, 72%, 76%, 76%, 76%; Test Accuracy: 75%
  - 76%, 76%, 76%, 76%, 76%, 76%; Test Accuracy: 62.5%
  - 76%, 76%, 76%, 76%, 76%, 76%; Test Accuracy: 62.5%

- **Accuracy During Iterations:**
  - 57.14%
  - 51.43%
  - 60%
  - 80%
  - **Current Accuracy: 65.71%**

The current accuracy indicates moderate effectiveness of the rules in predicting the modifier's effect on catalyst loading. However, the fact that a previous iteration achieved an accuracy of 80% suggests that the current rules may not be the most optimal, and there is room for improvement.

**2. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Overfitting:** The model does not consistently show high accuracy across different datasets. The fluctuations in accuracy suggest that the model may not be overfitting significantly, as overfitting generally results in high training accuracy but poor validation accuracy.

- **Underfitting:** The moderate accuracy indicates that the model might be underfitting, meaning it does not capture all the underlying patterns in the data due to overly simplistic rules or insufficient feature representation.

Given the inconsistencies and moderate accuracy, it appears that the current rules may be underfitting the data, and further refinement could help capture more nuanced patterns.

**3. Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values help identify which rules contribute most significantly to the model's predictions, especially in cases where predictions do not match experimental values.

**Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

For molecules where the predicted loading is **high** but the experimental value is **low**, the rules with the most **positive SHAP values** are likely causing the overestimation.

- **Molecule:** C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
  - **Rules with Positive SHAP Values:**
    - **Rule 4:** SHAP value = 0.0223
    - **Rule 5:** SHAP value = 0.0441
    - **Rule 8:** SHAP value = 0.0884

- **Molecule:** C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O
  - **Same rules contributing to overestimation.**

**Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

For molecules where the predicted loading is **low** but the experimental value is **high**, the rules with the most **negative SHAP values** are likely causing the underestimation.

- **Molecule:** C1=CC2=C(C=C1C(=O)O)C(=O)OC2=O
  - **Rules with Negative SHAP Values:**
    - **Rule 5:** SHAP value = 0.0201 (positive but low compared to others)
    - **Rule 8:** SHAP value = 0.0605

In this case, the SHAP values are positive, indicating that perhaps no specific rule is contributing significantly to the underestimation, or the lack of certain rules (absence of positive contributions) might be causing it.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

The model's accuracy has not consistently increased across iterations, and the current accuracy of 65.71% is lower than the 80% achieved previously. This suggests that while some rules may have improved the model's performance, others may have reduced it. The lack of a clear upward trend indicates that we may have reached a plateau, and further iterations using the current approach may not yield significant improvements without refining the rules.

**5. Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule 4 (Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups):**
  - Consistently contributing positive SHAP values.
  - May be overgeneralizing, leading to overestimations in some cases.

- **Rule 5 (Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains):**
  - Positive SHAP values in overestimations and sometimes in underestimations.
  - May need refinement to better distinguish between modifiers.

- **Rule 8 (Modifiers containing highly electronegative or electron-withdrawing substituents):**
  - Positive SHAP values contributing to overestimations.
  - The rule is supposed to assign low yield to such modifiers, but SHAP values suggest it may not be effectively discriminating.

**6. Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis, we suggest the following improvements:

**Refine Rules Associated with Overestimated Loadings:**

- **Rule 4 Refinement:**
  - **Current Rule:** Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups yield high yield.
  - **Issue:** Overestimation in molecules where multiple hydroxyl groups do not enhance metal coordination effectively due to steric hindrance or absence of other coordinating groups.
  - **Suggested Improvement:**
    - Specify the position and context of hydroxyl groups.
    - Consider only modifiers where hydroxyl groups are positioned to facilitate chelation with the metal center.
    - Exclude modifiers where hydroxyl groups are hindered or part of bulky structures that prevent effective coordination.

- **Rule 5 Refinement:**
  - **Current Rule:** Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yield.
  - **Issue:** Thiol groups may not always enhance yield, especially if other functional groups interfere or if the thiol is sterically hindered.
  - **Suggested Improvement:**
    - Add conditions for the proximity of thiol groups to the carboxyl group.
    - Exclude modifiers where the thiol group is attached to secondary or tertiary carbons that may hinder coordination.
    - Consider the presence of other electron-withdrawing groups that may reduce thiol effectiveness.

**Adjust Rules Associated with Underestimated Loadings:**

- **Rule 8 Refinement:**
  - **Current Rule:** Modifiers with highly electronegative or electron-withdrawing substituents yield low yield.
  - **Issue:** Some modifiers with such substituents still yield high experimental loading, indicating the rule may be too broad.
  - **Suggested Improvement:**
    - Narrow down the types of electron-withdrawing groups that truly lead to low yield.
    - Consider exceptions where electron-withdrawing groups are balanced by strong coordinating sites elsewhere in the molecule.
    - Introduce sub-rules to differentiate between different types of electron-withdrawing substituents.

**Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting:**

- **Enhance Rule Specificity:**
  - Incorporate additional structural factors into the rules, such as ring size, stereochemistry, and electronic effects.
  - Use more specific molecular descriptors to capture subtle differences between modifiers.

- **Incorporate Negative Rules:**
  - Include rules that specifically identify modifiers that yield low yield despite meeting criteria in other rules.
  - This can help prevent overestimations by adding counterbalance.

**Use Insights from SHAP Analysis to Iteratively Refine Rules:**

- Analyze the SHAP values for each rule across all molecules to identify patterns.
- For rules contributing to misclassifications, consider whether they should be split into multiple rules with more precise conditions.
- Continuously validate the impact of each rule on model performance after adjustments.

**Example of Rule Refinement Based on SHAP Insights:**

- **Rule 4 Revised:**
  - **New Rule 4A:** Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high yield.
  - **New Rule 4B:** Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups located on bulky aliphatic chains or distant from the carboxyl group yield low yield.
  - **Rationale:** Positioning of hydroxyl groups affects their ability to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 5 Revised:**
  - **New Rule 5A:** Modifiers with primary thiol groups near the carboxyl group yield high yield.
  - **New Rule 5B:** Modifiers with thiol groups attached to secondary or tertiary carbons, or distant from the carboxyl group, yield low yield.
  - **Rationale:** The accessibility and positioning of the thiol group impact coordination effectiveness.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules provides a foundational understanding of how molecular modifiers influence catalyst loading. However, to improve the model's predictive accuracy, we need to refine these rules to capture more specific structural nuances.

By analyzing the SHAP values and focusing on rules contributing to misclassifications, we can make targeted adjustments that enhance the model's performance. Refining rules to be more specific and splitting overly broad rules into sub-rules allows for better discrimination between modifiers with similar features but different experimental outcomes.

**Next Steps**

- **Implement the refined rules** and re-evaluate the model's performance.
- **Monitor changes in validation accuracy** to assess the impact of the adjustments.
- **Iteratively refine** the rules based on further SHAP analyses and performance metrics.
- **Expand the dataset**, if possible, to include more diverse modifiers that can help train a more robust model.

By following these recommendations, we aim to improve the model's accuracy and generalization, leading to better predictions of catalyst loading based on molecular modifier structures.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

The recent evaluation of the rules designed to predict the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has highlighted both strengths and areas for improvement.

**1. Performance Metrics and Model Analysis**

- **Confidence and Lift:**
  - The current rules exhibit increased **confidence** and **lift** compared to previous iterations. This indicates that when the rules apply, they are more likely to correctly predict high yields.
  - For example, **Rule 1** improved in confidence from 63.52% to 73.33% and in lift from 1.2048 to 1.4656.

- **Support:**
  - There is a notable decrease in **support**, meaning the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.
  - Low support suggests that while the rules are accurate for certain cases, they are not general enough to cover a wider range of modifiers.

- **Accuracy and SHAP Analysis:**
  - The model's 5-fold validation accuracy is **65.71%**, which is moderate but lower than some previous iterations that achieved up to 80% accuracy.
  - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis reveals that some rules contribute to misclassifications:
    - **Overestimations:** Certain rules assign high yield predictions to modifiers that experimentally result in low yields.
    - **Underestimations:** Some modifiers with high experimental yields are predicted to have low yields due to the influence of specific rules.

**2. Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

To enhance the predictive power and applicability of the rules, the following recommendations are proposed:

**a. Revise and Refine Existing Rules**

- **Rule 1 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids):**
  - **Issue:** The SMARTS pattern may not capture all relevant compounds.
  - **Suggestion:** Revise the SMARTS pattern to accurately identify α-amino dicarboxylic acids, ensuring it accounts for side chains and additional carboxyl groups.

- **Rule 2 (Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids):**
  - **Issue:** With a confidence of 50% and a lift of 1.0, Rule 2 does not improve predictive capability.
  - **Suggestion:**
    - Reevaluate the structural features included in this rule.
    - Split the rule into separate sub-rules for high yield and low yield modifiers to increase specificity.
    - Investigate additional functional groups or substituents that may influence yield.

- **Rule 4 (Polyhydroxylated Acids):**
  - **Issue:** Potential misclassification due to incorrect counting of hydroxyl groups.
  - **Suggestion:** Adjust the rule to ensure that only free hydroxyl groups are counted (excluding those in carboxylic acid functionalities), and specify the position of hydroxyl groups to improve accuracy.

- **Rule 5 (Thiol Groups):**
  - **Issue:** Overestimations occur when thiol groups are present but do not enhance yield due to steric hindrance or other factors.
  - **Suggestion:** Refine the rule to consider the proximity of thiol groups to the carboxyl group and the carbon type (primary vs. secondary/tertiary) they are attached to.

- **Rule 8 (Electron-Withdrawing Substituents):**
  - **Issue:** Some modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups still exhibit high yields, indicating overgeneralization.
  - **Suggestion:** Narrow the scope of the rule by specifying which electron-withdrawing groups significantly impact yield and considering the presence of other coordinating groups that may offset the effect.

**b. Enhance Rule Support**

- Broaden the conditions of existing rules to include more modifiers without significantly reducing confidence.
- Combine similar rules or identify overarching patterns to create more inclusive rules that cover a larger portion of the dataset.

**c. Balance Specificity and Generality**

- Ensure that rules are neither too narrow (causing low support) nor too broad (reducing confidence and lift).
- Avoid overfitting by generalizing rules based on underlying chemical principles rather than specific examples in the dataset.

**d. Incorporate Additional Data Analysis**

- **Statistical Analysis:** Examine the dataset for other molecular descriptors (e.g., electronic properties, steric factors) that correlate with yield.
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** Utilize algorithms like decision trees or random forests to uncover complex patterns not captured by the current rules.

**e. Iterative Refinement and Validation**

- Continuously refine the rules based on performance metrics, ensuring that each iteration brings improvements.
- Validate rule changes using cross-validation and test datasets to assess their impact on predictive accuracy.

**3. Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is clear potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Increasing Support:** By carefully broadening the rules, we can increase their applicability to more modifiers while maintaining high confidence levels.
- **Refining Underperforming Rules:** Addressing issues with specific rules (e.g., Rule 2, Rule 4, Rule 5) can enhance their predictive value and reduce misclassifications.
- **Preventing Overfitting:** By grounding rule refinements in fundamental chemical knowledge and validating changes across different datasets, we can improve the model without tailoring it too closely to the training data.

**Conclusion**

Further optimization of the current rules is both possible and advisable to enhance the model's accuracy and applicability.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows for effective chelation with metal ions (such as Fe³⁺), enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. This strong coordination increases the catalyst's efficiency, leading to a higher yield of the reaction.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with substituents capable of strong metal coordination (e.g., amino, nitro groups) yield high yield; those with non-coordinating or electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., methyl, formyl, thiol groups) yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Substituents like amino and nitro groups can donate electron density or coordinate directly with metal centers, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and improving catalytic activity. In contrast, substituents like methyl or formyl groups are non-coordinating and may withdraw electron density from the ring, reducing the ability of the modifier to stabilize the metal catalyst, resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with short aliphatic chains (up to eight carbons) yield high yield if they contain coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups) near the carboxyl end; chains longer than eight carbons or with distal functional groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **octanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Short-chain modifiers with coordinating groups near the carboxyl group can effectively interact with metal centers due to proximity, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity. Simple fatty acids like octanoic acid may increase the hydrophobic environment around the catalyst, improving its performance. Longer chains with functional groups far from the carboxyl group have reduced coordination ability due to steric hindrance and decreased interaction with the metal center, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, especially polyhydroxylated acids, yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination.**
  - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal ions, significantly enhancing metal-ligand interactions. This strong chelation stabilizes the metal catalyst, improving its reactivity and leading to higher yields in the reaction.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yield; thiol groups attached to aromatic rings yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and can effectively coordinate with metal centers through the sulfur atom, forming strong metal-thiol bonds that enhance catalyst performance. In contrast, thiol groups attached to aromatic rings are less available for coordination due to the rigidity of the ring and possible resonance delocalization of the sulfur's lone pair, reducing their coordinating ability and resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential deactivation of the catalyst.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with metal ions or amino groups in the catalyst system, forming Schiff bases or other inactive complexes. This side reaction depletes the active catalyst species and deactivates the catalyst, leading to lower yields in the target reaction.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low yield unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups like multiple hydroxyl or amino groups.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *High Yield Exception*: **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are relatively weak ligands for metal coordination due to their lone pairs being delocalized over adjacent atoms. Modifiers with ether linkages generally do not enhance catalyst performance unless they include additional strong coordinating groups (e.g., multiple hydroxyl groups) that can compensate by providing effective metal-binding sites.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing highly electronegative or electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains) yield low yield.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electron density to the metal center. This results in poor metal-ligand interactions, decreasing catalytic activity and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield low yield unless the aromatic ring contains an additional heteroatom capable of coordination.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms (like in phenylalanine) do not provide additional coordination sites for metal ions and thus do not enhance the catalyst's performance. In contrast, heteroaromatic rings (like the indole ring in tryptophan) contain nitrogen atoms that can coordinate with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high yield; if the nitrogen-containing ring is not directly attached, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: When nitrogen-containing heterocycles are adjacent to the carboxyl group, they can form chelating bidentate ligands with metal ions, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity. If the heterocycle is separated by additional rings or linkers, this chelation is hindered, reducing the modifier's ability to stabilize the metal catalyst and decreasing yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing acylated amino groups (e.g., amide linkages) yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation converts amino groups into amides, which are poor ligands for metal coordination due to resonance delocalization of the lone pair on nitrogen. This decreases the modifier's ability to interact with and stabilize the metal catalyst, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains of five carbons yield high yield; shorter chains with phenolic groups yield low yield due to steric constraints.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. Shorter chains limit the mobility of the phenolic group, hindering effective coordination due to steric constraints and leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected to carbonyl-containing side chains yield high yield due to enhanced metal interactions.**
  - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatic systems can engage in π-backbonding and coordinate with metal centers through their delocalized π-electron systems. When connected to carbonyl-containing side chains, these modifiers can stabilize the metal catalyst through multiple coordination modes, improving its reactivity and leading to higher yields.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been formulated to accurately describe the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yield. They consider combinations of functional groups and structural motifs, such as the presence of coordinating atoms (nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur), the position and type of substituents on aromatic rings, chain length, and electron-donating or -withdrawing effects. By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on its structure.

The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity. They combine multiple substructures when necessary to reflect the underlying physicochemical properties that influence catalyst performance, such as metal coordination ability, steric factors, and electronic effects. This approach ensures that the rules are comprehensive and can be effectively applied to a wide range of modifiers within the dataset.---------------------------------------------------------------

**End of Advice**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions like Fe³⁺. This enhances the stability and reactivity of the catalyst by effectively bridging the metal centers, leading to higher yields in the reaction.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield if the substituent is an amino or nitro group; substituents like methyl, formyl, or thiol groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Amino and nitro groups can coordinate with metal centers or influence electron density favorably, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Methyl and formyl groups are non-coordinating and may withdraw electron density, reducing the modifier's ability to stabilize the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons yield high yield if they contain coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol) near the carboxyl end; longer chains without proximal coordinating groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **octanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Short to medium-chain fatty acids with coordinating groups near the carboxylate can effectively bind metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Longer chains or distal functional groups reduce coordination efficiency due to increased steric hindrance and decreased proximity to the metal site.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination through multiple binding sites.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination points, enabling strong chelation with metal ions. This increases catalyst stability and reactivity, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yield; thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and can form strong bonds with metal centers through the sulfur atom. Aromatic thiols are less effective due to the rigidity of the aromatic system and potential delocalization of the sulfur's lone pair electrons, reducing their coordinating ability.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential deactivation of the catalyst through side reactions.**
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with amino groups or metal ions in the catalyst system, forming inactive complexes such as Schiff bases. This depletes active catalyst species and reduces reaction yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low yield unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups like multiple hydroxyl or amino groups.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *High Yield Exception*: **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (due to multiple hydroxyl groups).
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weakly coordinating due to their electron lone pairs being delocalized. Additional strong coordinating groups are necessary to enhance metal-ligand interactions and improve catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing highly electronegative or electron-withdrawing substituents, such as perfluoroalkyl groups, yield low yield.**
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electrons to metal centers. This leads to poor coordination and reduced catalytic performance.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield low yield unless the aromatic ring contains an additional heteroatom capable of coordination (e.g., nitrogen in indole).**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms do not provide additional coordination sites. Heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers through their heteroatoms, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high yield; if the nitrogen-containing ring is separated by additional rings or linkers, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows for effective chelation through bidentate coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Separation by additional structures hinders this interaction, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing acylated amino groups (amide linkages) yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability of the nitrogen atom.**
  - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: In amide groups, the lone pair on nitrogen is delocalized with the carbonyl group, making it less available for metal coordination. This weakens the interaction with the catalyst and decreases yield.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains of five carbons yield high yield; shorter chains with phenolic groups yield low yield due to steric constraints and reduced flexibility.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. Shorter chains limit mobility and hinder coordination, reducing catalytic performance.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected to carbonyl-containing side chains yield high yield due to enhanced interactions with metal centers.**
  - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatics can participate in π-interactions with metal centers, and adjacent carbonyl groups can further coordinate metals, enhancing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing acyl or trifluoroacetyl groups adjacent to potential coordinating atoms yield low yield.**
  - *Examples*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on potential coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to bind metal ions and decreasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with multiple methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yield due to increased electron density and enhanced metal coordination ability.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are electron-donating, increasing the electron density of the aromatic ring and enhancing its ability to interact with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

**End of Rules**

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Rule 4 by increasing data support and possibly combining with similar modifiers.**
  - **Action**: Search for additional modifiers in the dataset or literature that have multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone. Examples could include sugar acids or polyols with carboxylic acid functionality.
  - **Reasoning**: Currently, Rule 4 is supported by only one data point, limiting its robustness. Increasing the number of examples will strengthen the rule's validity and applicability.

- **Advice 2**: **Augment Rule 5 with more examples to improve coverage and reliability.**
  - **Action**: Identify additional modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains that yield high yields and those with thiol groups on aromatic rings that yield low yields.
  - **Reasoning**: With minimal data support, the rule's predictive power is limited. Expanding the dataset will enhance confidence in the rule and its practical utility.

- **Advice 3**: **Expand Rule 8 by incorporating more data points or merging it with a broader rule on electron-withdrawing groups.**
  - **Action**: Look for other modifiers containing highly electronegative or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, cyano, halogens) and assess their impact on yield. Consider combining Rule 8 with Rule 14, which also addresses electron-withdrawing substituents.
  - **Reasoning**: A single data point undermines the rule's robustness. Merging similar rules can create a more comprehensive rule with better coverage.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rule 9 by gathering additional examples and specifying the role of heteroatoms in aromatic side chains.**
  - **Action**: Investigate other amino acids or modifiers with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., histidine) and determine their effect on yield. Clarify the types of heteroatoms and their positions that are beneficial for coordination.
  - **Reasoning**: Limited examples reduce the rule's applicability. More data and clearer definitions will improve the rule's clarity and usefulness.

- **Advice 5**: **Reevaluate Rule 10 to account for exceptions and improve clarity regarding "direct attachment."**
  - **Action**: Analyze modifiers like **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** that don't fit the current rule but yield high yield. Adjust the rule to encompass such cases or provide additional criteria that influence the yield.
  - **Reasoning**: Exceptions indicate that the rule may be oversimplified or missing critical factors. Refining the rule will enhance its predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 6**: **Strengthen Rule 11 by seeking more supporting data or integrating it into a broader rule about coordination ability.**
  - **Action**: Find additional modifiers with acylated amino groups and evaluate their yields. If data remain limited, consider merging this rule with others that address reduced coordination due to functional group modifications.
  - **Reasoning**: With only one example, the rule lacks robustness. Merging can provide better coverage and a more holistic understanding.

- **Advice 7**: **Clarify Rule 13 by defining "electron-rich aromatic systems" and increasing data support.**
  - **Action**: Specify what constitutes an electron-rich system (e.g., presence of electron-donating groups like methoxy). Identify additional modifiers with such features and assess their yields.
  - **Reasoning**: Vague terms hinder the rule's applicability. Clear definitions and more examples will improve both clarity and coverage.

- **Advice 8**: **Consider combining Rules 14 and 8 to create a unified rule on electron-withdrawing groups reducing yield.**
  - **Action**: Develop a comprehensive rule that encompasses various electron-withdrawing substituents impacting yield negatively, supported by multiple examples.
  - **Reasoning**: Combining similar rules enhances coverage and simplifies the rule set, making it more user-friendly.

- **Advice 9**: **Increase data support for Rule 12 or adjust the chain length criteria based on additional data.**
  - **Action**: Collect more examples of modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains of varying lengths. Determine if the chain length threshold should be modified.
  - **Reasoning**: More data will help validate the chain length effect and refine the rule for better accuracy.

- **Advice 10**: **Reassess Rule 15 due to limited coverage and consider merging it with Rule 13 if appropriate.**
  - **Action**: Increase the number of examples with multiple methoxy groups and assess their yields. If they also fit the criteria of electron-rich aromatic systems, consider combining the rules.
  - **Reasoning**: Limited data weakens the rule. Merging can enhance coverage and reduce redundancy.

- **Advice 11**: **Simplify complex rules where possible and ensure clarity in definitions.**
  - **Action**: Review all rules for overly complex language or convoluted criteria. Simplify wording and ensure all terms are well-defined.
  - **Reasoning**: Clarity enhances usability. Simplifying rules without sacrificing essential details makes them more accessible to users.

- **Advice 12**: **Cross-validate rules with additional datasets or experimental results to ensure robustness.**
  - **Action**: Test the rules against new modifiers not included in the original dataset. Perform experimental reactions if resources allow.
  - **Reasoning**: Validation strengthens confidence in the rules and identifies any gaps or necessary adjustments.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions like Fe³⁺. This enhances catalyst stability and reactivity by effectively bridging metal centers, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield if the substituent is an amino or nitro group; substituents like methyl, formyl, or thiol groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Amino and nitro groups can coordinate with metal centers or influence electron density favorably, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Methyl and formyl groups are non-coordinating and may reduce electron density, weakening the modifier's ability to stabilize the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons yield high yield if they contain coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) near the carboxyl end; longer chains without proximal coordinating groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **octanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Short to medium-chain fatty acids with coordinating groups near the carboxylate can effectively bind metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Longer chains or distal functional groups reduce coordination efficiency due to increased steric hindrance.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination through multiple binding sites.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination points, enabling strong chelation with metal ions. This increases catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with amino groups or metal ions in the catalyst system, forming inactive complexes. This depletes active catalyst species and reduces reaction yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yield; thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and can form strong bonds with metal centers through the sulfur atom. Aromatic thiols are less effective due to the rigidity of the aromatic system and delocalization of the sulfur's lone pair electrons, reducing their coordinating ability.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high yield; if the nitrogen-containing ring is separated by additional rings or linkers, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows for effective chelation through bidentate coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Separation by additional structures hinders this interaction, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains yield low yield.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electrons to metal centers and leading to poor coordination.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low yield unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups like multiple hydroxyl or amino groups.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *High Yield Exception*: **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (due to multiple hydroxyl groups).
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weakly coordinating. Additional strong coordinating groups are necessary to enhance metal-ligand interactions and improve catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield high yield if the aromatic ring contains an additional heteroatom capable of coordination (e.g., nitrogen in indole); otherwise, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. Without heteroatoms, the side chains do not provide additional coordination sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing multiple methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yield due to increased electron density and enhanced metal coordination ability.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are electron-donating, increasing the electron density of the aromatic ring and enhancing its ability to interact with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated (forming amide linkages) yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability of the nitrogen atom.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: In amide groups, the lone pair on nitrogen is delocalized with the carbonyl group, making it less available for metal coordination. This weakens interaction with the catalyst and decreases yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with side chains containing trifluoroacetyl groups yield low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Trifluoroacetyl groups withdraw electron density from coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to bind metal ions and decreasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on longer aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) yield high yield; with shorter chains, yield is low due to reduced flexibility.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. Shorter chains limit mobility and hinder coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yield low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can engage in side reactions with catalyst components or reduce the availability of coordinating sites, leading to decreased catalyst effectiveness.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions like Fe³⁺. This enhances catalyst stability and reactivity by effectively bridging metal centers, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield if the substituent is an amino or nitro group; substituents like methyl, formyl, or thiol groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination points, enabling strong chelation with metal ions. This increases catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with amino groups or metal ions in the catalyst system, forming inactive complexes. This depletes active catalyst species and reduces reaction yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yield; thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and can form strong bonds with metal centers through the sulfur atom. Aromatic thiols are less effective due to the rigidity of the aromatic system and delocalization of the sulfur's lone pair electrons, reducing their coordinating ability.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high yield; if the nitrogen-containing ring is separated by additional rings or linkers, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows for effective chelation through bidentate coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Separation by additional structures hinders this interaction, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains yield low yield.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electrons to metal centers and leading to poor coordination.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low yield unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups like multiple hydroxyl or amino groups.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *High Yield Exception*: **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (due to multiple hydroxyl groups).
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weakly coordinating. Additional strong coordinating groups are necessary to enhance metal-ligand interactions and improve catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield high yield if the aromatic ring contains an additional heteroatom capable of coordination (e.g., nitrogen in indole); otherwise, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. Without heteroatoms, the side chains do not provide additional coordination sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing multiple methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yield due to increased electron density and enhanced metal coordination ability.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are electron-donating, increasing the electron density of the aromatic ring and enhancing its ability to interact with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated (forming amide linkages) yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability of the nitrogen atom.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: In amide groups, the lone pair on nitrogen is delocalized with the carbonyl group, making it less available for metal coordination. This weakens interaction with the catalyst and decreases yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with side chains containing trifluoroacetyl groups yield low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Trifluoroacetyl groups withdraw electron density from coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to bind metal ions and decreasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on longer aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) yield high yield; with shorter chains, yield is low due to reduced flexibility.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. Shorter chains limit mobility and hinder coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yield low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can engage in side reactions with catalyst components or reduce the availability of coordinating sites, leading to decreased catalyst effectiveness.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Generalize SMARTS patterns for Rule 2 to match any para-substituted benzoic acids with the specified substituents.**

  The current SMARTS patterns for Rule 2 in the code are too specific and only match exact molecules like para-aminobenzoic acid or para-nitrobenzoic acid. To accurately represent the rule, the SMARTS patterns should be generalized to match any benzoic acid with a substituent in the para position that is either an amino group or a nitro group.

  - **High Yield Substituents** (Amino or Nitro groups):

    Replace the specific SMARTS patterns with a generalized one:
    ```python
    # Generalized para-substituted benzoic acid with amino or nitro group
    para_benzoic_acid_high = 'c1cc([*:1])ccc1C(=O)[OH]'
    ```
    Then, check if the substituent at the para position (*:1) is an amino or nitro group:
    ```python
    amino_nitro_substituents = ['[NX3;H2,H1,H0]', '[N+](=O)[O-]']
    ```
    Use substructure matching to confirm that the substituent is either an amino or nitro group.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Generalize SMARTS patterns for Rule 2.1 to match any para-substituted benzoic acids with methyl, formyl, or thiol groups.**

  For low-yield substituents, the patterns should similarly be generalized:

  - **Low Yield Substituents** (Methyl, Formyl, or Thiol groups):

    ```python
    # Generalized para-substituted benzoic acid with methyl, formyl, or thiol group
    para_benzoic_acid_low = 'c1cc([*:1])ccc1C(=O)[OH]'
    ```
    Then, check if the substituent at the para position (*:1) is a methyl, formyl, or thiol group:
    ```python
    low_yield_substituents = ['C', 'C=O', 'S[H]']
    ```
    Use substructure matching to confirm that the substituent is one of the low-yield groups.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Improve the SMARTS patterns for Rule 6 to match thiol groups on any short aliphatic chain, not just specific ones.**

  The current pattern `[CX4][CX4][SX2H]` only matches thiol groups on exactly two-carbon chains. To generalize for short aliphatic chains (up to 4 carbons), modify the pattern:

  - **High Yield Aliphatic Thiols**:

    ```python
    aliphatic_thiol = '[CX4]([CX4]){0,3}[SX2H]'
    ```
    This pattern matches an aliphatic chain of 1 to 4 carbons ending with a thiol group.

  - **Low Yield Aromatic Thiols**:

    Ensure that any thiol directly attached to an aromatic ring is matched:
    ```python
    aromatic_thiol = '[c][SX2H]'
    ```

- **Suggestion 4**: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 to capture all α-amino dicarboxylic acids, including those with substituents.**

  The current pattern may miss α-amino acids with substituents on the alpha carbon. A more general pattern is:

  ```python
  alpha_amino_acid_general = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```
  This allows for possible substitution on the nitrogen and ensures the correct connectivity.

  Additionally, ensure that there are at least two carboxylic acid groups:

  ```python
  carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```
  Use `GetSubstructMatches` to count occurrences properly, accounting for overlapping matches.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Implement functions to identify functional groups and structural motifs described in the rules rather than matching exact molecules.**

  Create helper functions, for example:

  ```python
  def is_para_substituted_benzoic_acid(mol, substituent_smarts):
      # Pattern for benzoic acid core
      benzoic_acid_core = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)[OH]')
      if not mol.HasSubstructMatch(benzoic_acid_core):
          return False
      # Find substitution patterns in para position
      # Implement logic to determine if the substituent is at the para position
      # and matches the desired substituent patterns
      # ...
  ```
  This approach allows for more flexible and accurate matching according to the chemical rules.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Use recursive SMARTS or enhanced substructure searches for more accurate functional group identification.**

  Some functional groups may require recursive SMARTS patterns to capture complex substitutions or ring systems. For instance:

  ```python
  # Recursive pattern to match alpha-amino acid regardless of substituents
  alpha_amino_acid_recursive = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4;$([CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1])]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 7**: **Ensure overlapping matches are handled correctly when counting functional groups like carboxylic acids.**

  Overlapping substructure matches can cause undercounting or overcounting. Use the following to get unique matches:

  ```python
  carboxylic_acid_matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts(carboxylic_acid), uniquify=True)
  num_carboxylic_acids = len(carboxylic_acid_matches)
  ```

- **Suggestion 8**: **Leverage RDKit's built-in functionalities for pharmacophore mapping or functional group enumeration to enhance rule implementation.**

  RDKit offers advanced features that can help identify functional groups more reliably:

  ```python
  from rdkit.Chem.Fragments import fr_carboxylicacid

  num_carboxylic_acids = fr_carboxylicacid(mol)
  ```

- **Suggestion 9**: **Test and validate each rule implementation individually with known molecules to ensure accuracy before applying to the entire dataset.**

  Create a test suite with examples that should and should not match each rule to verify that the code performs as expected.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions like Fe³⁺. This enhances catalyst stability and reactivity by effectively bridging metal centers, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield if the substituent is an amino or nitro group; substituents like methyl, formyl, or thiol groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Amino and nitro groups can coordinate with metal centers or influence electron density favorably, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Methyl and formyl groups are non-coordinating and may reduce electron density, weakening the modifier's ability to stabilize the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons yield high yield if they contain coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) near the carboxyl end; longer chains without proximal coordinating groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **octanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Short to medium-chain fatty acids with coordinating groups near the carboxylate can effectively bind metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Longer chains or distal functional groups reduce coordination efficiency due to increased steric hindrance.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination through multiple binding sites.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination points, enabling strong chelation with metal ions. This increases catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with amino groups or metal ions in the catalyst system, forming inactive complexes. This depletes active catalyst species and reduces reaction yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yield; thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and can form strong bonds with metal centers through the sulfur atom. Aromatic thiols are less effective due to the rigidity of the aromatic system and delocalization of the sulfur's lone pair electrons, reducing their coordinating ability.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high yield; if the nitrogen-containing ring is separated by additional rings or linkers, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows for effective chelation through bidentate coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Separation by additional structures hinders this interaction, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains yield low yield.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electrons to metal centers and leading to poor coordination.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low yield unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups like multiple hydroxyl or amino groups.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *High Yield Exception*: **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (due to multiple hydroxyl groups).
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weakly coordinating. Additional strong coordinating groups are necessary to enhance metal-ligand interactions and improve catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield high yield if the aromatic ring contains an additional heteroatom capable of coordination (e.g., nitrogen in indole); otherwise, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. Without heteroatoms, the side chains do not provide additional coordination sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing multiple methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yield due to increased electron density and enhanced metal coordination ability.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are electron-donating, increasing the electron density of the aromatic ring and enhancing its ability to interact with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated (forming amide linkages) yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability of the nitrogen atom.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: In amide groups, the lone pair on nitrogen is delocalized with the carbonyl group, making it less available for metal coordination. This weakens interaction with the catalyst and decreases yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with side chains containing trifluoroacetyl groups yield low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Trifluoroacetyl groups withdraw electron density from coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to bind metal ions and decreasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on longer aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) yield high yield; with shorter chains, yield is low due to reduced flexibility.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. Shorter chains limit mobility and hinder coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yield low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can engage in side reactions with catalyst components or reduce the availability of coordinating sites, leading to decreased catalyst effectiveness.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Include the `carboxylic_acid_count` pattern in the `patterns` list for Rule 1 to ensure that the code counts the number of carboxylic acid groups correctly.** Currently, the `count_threshold` refers to a pattern (`carboxylic_acid_count`) that isn't included in the `patterns` list. By adding this pattern to the list, the code can properly match and count the carboxylic acid groups as intended.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Modify the SMARTS patterns for para-substituted benzoic acids in Rules 2 and 3 to accurately represent para substitution relative to the carboxylic acid group.** The current SMARTS patterns may not match molecules where the substituent positions vary. Use a more general pattern such as `c1cc(ccc1[X])C(=O)[O-,OH]` where `[X]` represents the substituent group (amino, nitro, methyl, formyl, thiol). This approach ensures that the para relationship between the substituent and the carboxylic acid is correctly identified.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Review and correct the SMARTS patterns for functional groups and structural features to ensure they accurately reflect the natural language rules.** For example, the `alpha_amino_acid` pattern in Rule 1 should be verified to match α-amino acids correctly. Adjustments may be needed to capture the specific bonding and stereochemistry associated with α-amino dicarboxylic acids.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Ensure that the code's logic accounts for multiple patterns when using `count_threshold` and that thresholds are applied to the correct patterns.** In cases where counts of specific functional groups are critical (e.g., multiple hydroxyl groups in Rule 4), the patterns for these groups must be included in the `patterns` list, and the code should accurately count their occurrences.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Update the code to handle substituent positions flexibly, especially for aromatic rings.** Use recursive SMARTS or position-independent patterns to match substituents on aromatic systems, ensuring that variations in SMILES notation do not prevent correct matching.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Simplify complex SMARTS patterns by breaking them into smaller, more general sub-patterns that can be combined logically in the code.** This can enhance matching accuracy across diverse molecules and reduce the likelihood of missing valid matches due to overly specific patterns.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Incorporate additional logging or debugging outputs in the code to identify when and why certain molecules do not match the expected patterns.** This transparency can help diagnose issues in pattern matching and improve the overall effectiveness of the transformation process.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **For rules with `exclude_patterns`, verify that the exclusion logic correctly prevents matches when appropriate.** Ensure that the code checks `exclude_patterns` before adding a prediction for a rule, and that it correctly handles cases where multiple exclusions might apply.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Test the updated code with known positive and negative examples for each rule to validate that pattern matching works as intended.** This practical verification can help ensure that the transformation aligns with the natural language descriptions and that the feature matrix accurately reflects the rules.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Consider using cheminformatics toolkits or libraries that support advanced SMARTS matching and can handle stereochemistry, tautomers, and resonance structures effectively.** This can improve the robustness of pattern matching and ensure accurate identification of functional groups and structural motifs.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions like Fe³⁺. This enhances catalyst stability and reactivity by effectively bridging metal centers, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield if the substituent is an amino or nitro group; substituents like methyl, formyl, or thiol groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Amino and nitro groups can coordinate with metal centers or influence electron density favorably, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Methyl and formyl groups are non-coordinating and may reduce electron density, weakening the modifier's ability to stabilize the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons yield high yield if they contain coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) near the carboxyl end; longer chains without proximal coordinating groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **octanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Short to medium-chain fatty acids with coordinating groups near the carboxylate can effectively bind metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Longer chains or distal functional groups reduce coordination efficiency due to increased steric hindrance.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination through multiple binding sites.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination points, enabling strong chelation with metal ions. This increases catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with amino groups or metal ions in the catalyst system, forming inactive complexes. This depletes active catalyst species and reduces reaction yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yield; thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and can form strong bonds with metal centers through the sulfur atom. Aromatic thiols are less effective due to the rigidity of the aromatic system and delocalization of the sulfur's lone pair electrons, reducing their coordinating ability.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high yield; if the nitrogen-containing ring is separated by additional rings or linkers, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows for effective chelation through bidentate coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Separation by additional structures hinders this interaction, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains yield low yield.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electrons to metal centers and leading to poor coordination.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low yield unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups like multiple hydroxyl or amino groups.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *High Yield Exception*: **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (due to multiple hydroxyl groups).
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weakly coordinating. Additional strong coordinating groups are necessary to enhance metal-ligand interactions and improve catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield high yield if the aromatic ring contains an additional heteroatom capable of coordination (e.g., nitrogen in indole); otherwise, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. Without heteroatoms, the side chains do not provide additional coordination sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing multiple methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yield due to increased electron density and enhanced metal coordination ability.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are electron-donating, increasing the electron density of the aromatic ring and enhancing its ability to interact with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated (forming amide linkages) yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability of the nitrogen atom.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: In amide groups, the lone pair on nitrogen is delocalized with the carbonyl group, making it less available for metal coordination. This weakens interaction with the catalyst and decreases yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with side chains containing trifluoroacetyl groups yield low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Trifluoroacetyl groups withdraw electron density from coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to bind metal ions and decreasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on longer aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) yield high yield; with shorter chains, yield is low due to reduced flexibility.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. Shorter chains limit mobility and hinder coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yield low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can engage in side reactions with catalyst components or reduce the availability of coordinating sites, leading to decreased catalyst effectiveness.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct the Substituent Representations in Rules 2 and 3**

  The substituents used in the `para_substituted_benzoic_acid_template` for Rules 2 and 3 are not accurately represented in SMARTS syntax. Specifically:
  
  - For the amino group, instead of `'N'`, use `'[NH2]'` to represent the primary amino group attached to the ring.
  - For the nitro group, `'[N+](=O)[O-]'` is correct.
  - For the methyl group, `'C'` is insufficient because it represents any carbon atom. Use `'[CH3]'` to specify a methyl group.
  - For the formyl group, `'C=O'` is not valid SMARTS syntax. Use `'[CX3H](=O)'` to represent an aldehyde group attached to the ring.
  - For the thiol group, `'S'` represents any sulfur atom. Use `'[SH]'` to specify a thiol group.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Revise the Template for Para-Substitution**

  The current `para_substituted_benzoic_acid_template` may not correctly position the substituents in the para position. Modify the template to ensure accurate placement:
  
  ```python
  para_substituted_benzoic_acid_template = 'c1cc([*:1])ccc1C(=O)[O-,OH]'
  ```
  
  This ensures that the substituent `[*:1]` is attached to the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Adjust Substituent Replacement Logic**

  Instead of simple string replacement, construct the SMARTS patterns by combining the template with substituents more carefully. For example:
  
  ```python
  amino_pattern = 'c1cc([H])ccc1C(=O)[O-,OH]'  # Assign hydrogen to the para position
  amino_substituted = amino_pattern.replace('[H]', '[NH2]')
  ```
  
  Repeat this for each substituent, ensuring correct syntax and attachment.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Validate SMARTS Patterns Against Examples**

  Before applying the patterns to the full dataset, test them against known examples to ensure they match correctly. Use RDKit's `MolFromSmarts` and `HasSubstructMatch` functions for validation.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Enhance Specificity in Patterns for Rules Involving Functional Groups**

  For rules that involve specific functional groups, ensure the SMARTS patterns accurately reflect the required structures. For example:
  
  - **Rule 5 (Aldehyde Group)**: The pattern `'[CX3H](=O)'` may match aldehydes not adjacent to carboxylic acids. Refine the pattern to `'[CX3H](=O)[#6][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to match aldehydes adjacent to a carboxylic acid.
  
  - **Rule 15 (Keto Adjacent to Carboxylic Acid)**: The pattern `'[CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` should be verified for accuracy, ensuring it matches the intended structure.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Account for Aromaticity and Ring Structures Correctly**

  In rules involving aromatic systems (e.g., Rules 2, 3, 9, 10), ensure that the SMARTS patterns correctly specify aromatic atoms and bonds using lower-case symbols. For example:
  
  - Use `'c'` for aromatic carbon atoms.
  - Ensure that substituents are attached to aromatic carbons appropriately.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Refine Patterns for Chain Lengths and Positions**

  For rules that depend on chain lengths or positions of functional groups (e.g., Rules 3, 14), adjust the patterns to accurately reflect these requirements. For example:
  
  - **Rule 14**: For phenolic hydroxyl groups on longer aliphatic chains, ensure the chain length is correctly specified in the pattern, such as `'c[OH][CH2]{4}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Implement Counting Mechanisms Correctly**

  When rules require counting specific functional groups (e.g., multiple hydroxyls in Rule 4), ensure that the code correctly counts occurrences. Use RDKit's `GetSubstructMatches` and verify counts meet the thresholds.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Handle Exclusions More Effectively**

  For rules with exclusion criteria, ensure that the code correctly applies these exclusions. For example, in Rule 5, modifiers should be excluded if they contain amino or hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl end even if they have long chains.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Improve Error Handling and Molecule Parsing**

  Add checks to handle cases where SMILES strings cannot be parsed, and provide informative messages or skip those entries gracefully.

**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Performance Metrics**

**1. Introduction**

The current set of rules aims to predict catalytic performance (high or low yield) based on the structural features of modifiers used in the catalytic process. The effectiveness of these rules can be evaluated using various metrics, particularly **confidence** and **lift**, which provide insights into the reliability and significance of the rules. Comparing these metrics to previous iterations allows us to assess progress and determine if further refinements are necessary.

---

**2. Comparison of Metrics**

**a. Confidence**

- **Previous Metrics (Train Confidence):**
  - Rule 1: 63.52%
  - Rule 2: 53.96%
- **Current Metrics (Train Confidence):**
  - Rule 1: 73.33%
  - Rule 2: 50%
  - Rule 3: 70.48%
  - Rule 4: 70.23%
  - Rule 5: 75%
  - **Overall Current Train Confidence:** 64.67%

**Observation:** The average confidence of the current rules (64.67%) is slightly higher than the average of the previous rules (58.74%). This indicates that the current rules are generally more reliable in predicting the outcomes.

**b. Lift**

- **Previous Metrics (Train Lift):**
  - Rule 1: 1.2048
  - Rule 2: 1.0559
- **Current Metrics (Train Lift):**
  - Rule 1: 1.4656
  - Rule 2: 1.0
  - Rule 3: 1.4161
  - Rule 4: 1.4018
  - Rule 5: 1.4902
  - **Overall Current Train Lift:** 1.2832

**Observation:** The current rules exhibit higher lift values compared to previous rules, indicating a stronger association between the rule conditions and the predictions. A lift greater than 1 suggests that the rule is significant and provides valuable information beyond random chance.

**c. Support**

- **Previous Metrics (Train Support):**
  - Rule 1: 16.67%
  - Rule 2: 18.45%
- **Current Metrics (Train Support):**
  - Rule 1: 2.29%
  - Rule 2: 0%
  - Rule 3: 7.05%
  - Rule 4: 13.71%
  - Rule 5: 4.64%
  - **Overall Current Train Support:** 2.14%

**Observation:** The support for the current rules is significantly lower than in previous iterations. Lower support implies that the rules apply to a smaller subset of the data, which may limit their generalizability.

---

**3. Interpretation and Insights**

**Strengths of Current Rules:**

- **Higher Confidence:** The increased confidence levels suggest the rules are more accurate in predicting high or low yields when the conditions are met.
- **Higher Lift Values:** Elevated lift indicates a stronger correlation between the conditions and the outcomes, enhancing the rules' usefulness in identifying significant patterns.

**Weaknesses of Current Rules:**

- **Low Support:** The reduced support means the rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset. This could be due to overly specific conditions that do not apply broadly.
- **Zero Support in Rule 2:** Rule 2 shows a train support of 0%, meaning it does not apply to any cases in the training dataset, rendering it ineffective.

---

**4. Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

Given the patterns in the metrics, it appears that:

- **Improvements Achieved:** Enhancements in confidence and lift suggest that the rules have become more precise.
- **Local Minimum Possibly Reached:** The increase in confidence and lift, coupled with a decrease in support, may indicate overfitting to specific instances. This pattern is characteristic of reaching a local minimum where further iterations might not yield significant improvements without addressing underlying issues.
- **Need for Further Iterations:** The low support values, especially the zero support in Rule 2, suggest that additional iterations are necessary to refine the rules for better applicability across the dataset.

---

**5. Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

**a. Increase Rule Support**

- **Broaden Rule Conditions:** Adjust the rules to be less restrictive, increasing the number of instances to which they apply.
- **Combine Similar Rules:** Merge rules with overlapping conditions to create more general rules with higher support.

**b. Address Overfitting**

- **Simplify Rules:** Remove overly specific criteria that may not generalize well to unseen data.
- **Validate with Test Data:** Assess the rules using a separate test set to ensure they perform well beyond the training data.

**c. Re-evaluate Ineffective Rules**

- **Rule 2 (Zero Support):** Reconsider the conditions of Rule 2 since it does not apply to any instances in the training data. It's essential to ensure that all rules have practical applicability.
- **Adjust Conditions for Balance:** Strive for a balance between confidence, lift, and support to develop robust rules.

**d. Incorporate Additional Data**

- **Gather More Samples:** Increasing the dataset size can provide more instances that fit the rule conditions, enhancing support.
- **Include Diverse Examples:** Expand the diversity of modifiers in the dataset to test the rules against a broader range of cases.

**e. Refine Rule Conditions Based on Chemical Insights**

- **Leverage Domain Knowledge:** Utilize chemical principles to adjust rules—for example, considering steric effects, electronic properties, and coordination chemistry.
- **Test Hypotheses Experimentally:** Where possible, validate rule predictions with experimental data to confirm their validity.

---

**6. Conclusion**

The current set of rules shows promise with higher confidence and lift values, indicating more reliable and significant predictions. However, the low support suggests the rules may be too narrow in scope, limiting their usefulness. To enhance performance, it's recommended to adjust the rules to be more general, ensuring they cover a larger portion of the dataset while maintaining high confidence and lift. Further iterations, guided by both statistical metrics and chemical intuition, are necessary to refine the rules and avoid potential overfitting.

---

**Summary of Next Steps:**

- **Review and Modify Rules with Low Support:** Focus on rules with minimal or zero support to enhance their applicability.
- **Balance Specificity and Generalizability:** Aim for rules that are specific enough to be meaningful but general enough to apply broadly.
- **Monitor Metrics Across Iterations:** Continue to track confidence, lift, and support to gauge improvements.
- **Collaborate with Domain Experts:** Engage with chemists to align rule conditions with known chemical behaviors and mechanisms.
- **Perform Cross-validation:** Use techniques like cross-validation to assess the robustness of the rules.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can become more effective tools for predicting catalytic performance and guiding experimental efforts in the research program.

The latest validation accuracy achieved using the classification model is **68.57%**. This is compared to previous reference accuracies, which were consistently around **76%** for validation and **75%** for test sets:

- Previous Accuracies for Reference:
  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625

The slight drop in accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be capturing all the necessary features to predict the modifier loading accurately.

**2. Assessment of Model Effectiveness**

- **Effectiveness of Current Rules**: The current rules achieve moderate accuracy but do not match the performance of previous iterations. This indicates that while the rules are capturing some patterns, there is room for improvement to enhance predictive capabilities.

- **Overfitting/Underfitting Analysis**: The moderate validation accuracy without significant variance suggests potential underfitting. The model may not be complex enough or might be missing critical features necessary to capture the underlying patterns in the data.

**3. Discrepancy Analysis Using SHAP Values**

We analyzed the SHAP values for molecules where the predicted modifier loading does not align with the experimental values to identify which rules may be contributing to mispredictions.

**Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

1. **Molecule**: C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
   - **Predicted Loading**: High
   - **Experimental Value**: Low
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - Rule7: **0.04699**
     - Rule9: **0.02551**
     - Rule11: **0.03122**
     - Rule16: **0.08199** (Highest SHAP value)
   - **Analysis**: Rule16 contributes the most to the overestimation, suggesting it may be overly general or misapplied to this molecule.

2. **Similar Cases**:
   - **Molecule**: C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O
     - **Predicted Loading**: High
     - **Experimental Value**: Low
     - **Highest SHAP Value**: Rule16
   - **Molecule**: C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN
     - **Predicted Loading**: High
     - **Experimental Value**: Low
     - **Highest SHAP Value**: Rule16
   - **Molecule**: C(CCCN)CCC(=O)O
     - **Predicted Loading**: High
     - **Experimental Value**: Low
     - **Highest SHAP Value**: Rule16
   - **Molecule**: COCCOCCOCC(=O)O
     - **Predicted Loading**: High
     - **Experimental Value**: Low
     - **Highest SHAP Value**: Rule16
   - **Molecule**: C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=NC=C2)C(=O)O
     - **Predicted Loading**: High
     - **Experimental Value**: Low
     - **Highest SHAP Value**: Rule16
   
   - **Observation**: In all these cases, Rule16 has the highest positive SHAP value, indicating it heavily influences the incorrect high predictions.

**Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

- **No instances** were identified in the latest SHAP analysis where the predicted loading was low, but the experimental value was high. This suggests fewer issues with underestimations in the current model.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

The decrease in validation accuracy compared to the previous benchmarks implies that the current rules may have introduced errors or failed to account for some critical features influencing the modifier loading. The consistent overestimations point toward specific rules contributing disproportionately to high loading predictions.

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule16**:
  - **Significance**: Consistently exhibits the highest positive SHAP values in cases of overestimated loading.
  - **Implication**: Rule16 may be too broadly defined or not accurately capturing the conditions that lead to high modifier loading.

- **Rule7, Rule9, Rule11**:
  - **Contribution**: These rules also have positive SHAP values but are less significant compared to Rule16.
  - **Implication**: While they contribute to the predictions, their impact is less critical, but they may still need refinement.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rule16**

- **Issue**: Rule16 is the primary contributor to the overestimation of modifier loading.
- **Action Steps**:
  - **Reevaluate the Definition**: Review the criteria of Rule16 to ensure it accurately reflects the structural features associated with high yield modifiers.
  - **Increase Specificity**: Introduce additional parameters or restrictions to the rule to prevent misclassification. For instance, consider adding exceptions for functional groups or molecular structures present in the overestimated molecules.
  - **Analyze Misclassified Molecules**: Examine the common features among the misclassified molecules to identify patterns that can be used to adjust Rule16.

**2. Review and Adjust Rule7, Rule9, and Rule11**

- **Issue**: These rules contribute to high predictions but to a lesser extent.
- **Action Steps**:
  - **Fine-tune Rule Definitions**: Ensure these rules are not too general and are appropriately weighted in the model.
  - **Cross-check with Correct Predictions**: Confirm that these rules are contributing positively in cases where the predictions match the experimental values to avoid diminishing their beneficial impact.

**3. Enhance Model Generalization**

- **Issue**: The model may be underfitting due to insufficient feature capture.
- **Action Steps**:
  - **Incorporate Additional Features**: Identify and include new relevant rules or descriptors that account for aspects not currently considered.
  - **Increase Data Diversity**: If possible, expand the dataset with more diverse examples to improve the model's learning and generalization capabilities.

**4. Utilize SHAP Analysis for Iterative Refinement**

- **Use SHAP Values to Guide Adjustments**:
  - **Target Problematic Rules**: Focus on rules with high SHAP values in misclassified instances for refinement.
  - **Monitor Changes**: After adjustments, use SHAP analysis to assess the impact on the predictions and further refine as necessary.

**5. Validate Adjusted Rules**

- **Evaluation Methods**:
  - **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of the model with the adjusted rules.
  - **Comparative Analysis**: Compare new validation accuracies with previous results to ensure that changes lead to genuine improvements.
  - **Iterative Testing**: Continually refine and test the rules in small increments to steadily enhance model performance without introducing overfitting.

**6. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**

- **Maintain Detailed Records**: Document the changes made to the rules and the rationale behind them to facilitate collaborative improvement and future reference.
- **Collaborate with Peers**: Engage with other researchers in the program to gain insights and validate the adjusted rules.

**Conclusion**

By concentrating on refining Rule16 and carefully adjusting other contributing rules, we can address the overestimation issues observed in the model. Utilizing SHAP analysis provides a data-driven approach to pinpoint and correct the specific areas where the model's predictions diverge from experimental observations. Through iterative refinement and validation, we aim to enhance the model's accuracy and reliability in predicting catalyst modifier loading.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

---

**1. Summary of Discussions:**

The current set of rules aims to predict the yield (high or low) of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on the structural features of molecular modifiers. Recent analyses have highlighted both strengths and weaknesses in these rules:

- **Strengths:**
  - **Higher Confidence and Lift Values:** The current rules exhibit increased confidence and lift compared to previous iterations, indicating stronger associations between the rule conditions and high yields.
  - **Chemical Rationales:** The rules are grounded in chemical principles, considering factors like coordination ability, electron density, and steric effects.

- **Weaknesses:**
  - **Low Support:** The support (i.e., the proportion of data the rules apply to) is significantly lower than in previous rules. Some rules have zero support, meaning they do not apply to any instances in the dataset.
  - **Overfitting Concerns:** High confidence and lift with low support may indicate that the rules are too specific, capturing noise rather than underlying trends.
  - **Misclassifications Identified via SHAP Analysis:**
    - Certain rules (e.g., **Rule16**) contribute disproportionately to incorrect high yield predictions.
    - Overestimations occur where the model predicts high yield but experimental results show low yield.

---

**2. Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

To optimize the current rules and enhance the predictive model's performance, the following actions are recommended:

**a. Correct and Refine SMARTS Patterns:**

- **Adjust Substituent Representations in Rules 2 and 3:**
  - **Amino Group:** Use `'[NH2]'` instead of `'N'`.
  - **Methyl Group:** Use `'[CH3]'` instead of `'C'`.
  - **Formyl Group:** Use `'[CX3H](=O)'` instead of `'C=O'`.
  - **Thiol Group:** Use `'[SH]'` instead of `'S'`.

- **Revise the Template for Para-Substitution:**
  - Ensure substituents are correctly positioned in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.
  - Updated template example:
    ```python
    para_substituted_benzoic_acid_template = 'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)[O-,OH]'
    ```
    Substitute the appropriate group at the correct position.

- **Enhance Specificity in Patterns for Functional Groups:**
  - Use precise SMARTS patterns that accurately represent the functional groups and their positions.
  - Confirm patterns match known examples using RDKit or similar tools.

**b. Increase Rule Support and Balance Specificity:**

- **Broaden Rule Conditions:**
  - Make rules less restrictive where possible to apply to a larger portion of the dataset.
  - Example: In rules requiring multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., **Rule 4**), consider including modifiers with at least two hydroxyl groups instead of requiring multiple.

- **Merge Similar Rules:**
  - Combine overlapping rules to enhance support and simplify the rule set.

- **Adjust Conditions for Balance:**
  - Strive for a balance between confidence, lift, and support.
  - Avoid overly broad rules that reduce confidence and lift, and overly narrow rules that reduce support.

**c. Reevaluate and Refine Ineffective Rules:**

- **Rule 2 (Zero Support):**
  - Reassess the conditions of Rule 2 since it does not apply to any instances.
  - Ensure SMARTS patterns correctly capture the intended structures.

- **Rule16 (High SHAP Contribution to Misclassifications):**
  - Reexamine Rule16 to determine why it leads to overestimations.
  - Introduce additional criteria or exceptions to improve its accuracy.
  - Consider splitting the rule into sub-rules with more specific conditions.

**d. Utilize SHAP Analysis for Targeted Refinement:**

- **Focus on Rules with High SHAP Values in Misclassifications:**
  - Modify rules contributing most to incorrect predictions.
  - For overestimations, adjust rules that consistently lead to false positives.

- **Monitor Changes with SHAP Values:**
  - After adjustments, use SHAP analysis to evaluate the impact on predictions.
  - Ensure that modifications lead to improvements without introducing new issues.

**e. Incorporate Additional Chemical Insights:**

- **Leverage Domain Knowledge:**
  - Consider steric hindrance, electronic effects, and chelation ability in rule definitions.
  - For example, account for the flexibility of aliphatic chains and resonance in aromatic systems.

- **Account for Aromaticity and Ring Structures Correctly:**
  - Use lowercase 'c' for aromatic carbons in SMARTS patterns.
  - Ensure substituents are correctly attached to the aromatic rings.

**f. Improve Rule Testing and Validation Processes:**

- **Validate SMARTS Patterns Against Known Examples:**
  - Test patterns on molecules with known outcomes to ensure accuracy before applying them broadly.

- **Implement Cross-Validation:**
  - Use cross-validation techniques to assess the model's robustness and prevent overfitting.

- **Iteratively Refine and Test Rules:**
  - Make incremental changes and evaluate their effects on model performance.

**g. Enhance Data Diversity and Representation:**

- **Expand the Dataset:**
  - Include more diverse modifiers to increase the representativeness of the data.

- **Ensure Quality of Data Inputs:**
  - Verify the accuracy of SMILES strings and associated experimental values.

---

**3. Judgment on Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

There is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By addressing the identified weaknesses—such as low support, incorrect SMARTS patterns, and rules contributing to misclassifications—the model can be improved. Careful refinement, informed by both statistical analysis and chemical expertise, can enhance the generalizability and predictive accuracy of the rules.

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions like Fe³⁺. This enhances catalyst stability and reactivity by effectively bridging metal centers, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield if the substituent is an amino or nitro group; substituents like methyl, formyl, or thiol groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Amino and nitro groups can coordinate with metal centers or influence electron density favorably, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Methyl and formyl groups are non-coordinating and may reduce electron density, weakening the modifier's ability to stabilize the metal catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons yield high yield if they contain coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) near the carboxyl end; longer chains without proximal coordinating groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **octanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Short to medium-chain fatty acids with coordinating groups near the carboxylate can effectively bind metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Longer chains or distal functional groups reduce coordination efficiency due to increased steric hindrance.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination through multiple binding sites.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination points, enabling strong chelation with metal ions. This increases catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with amino groups or metal ions in the catalyst system, forming inactive complexes. This depletes active catalyst species and reduces reaction yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high yield; thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols are flexible and can form strong bonds with metal centers through the sulfur atom. Aromatic thiols are less effective due to the rigidity of the aromatic system and delocalization of the sulfur's lone pair electrons, reducing their coordinating ability.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield high yield; if the nitrogen-containing ring is separated by additional rings or linkers, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows for effective chelation through bidentate coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Separation by additional structures hinders this interaction, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains yield low yield.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electrons to metal centers and leading to poor coordination.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with ether linkages yield low yield unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups like multiple hydroxyl or amino groups.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *High Yield Exception*: **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (due to multiple hydroxyl groups).
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are weakly coordinating. Additional strong coordinating groups are necessary to enhance metal-ligand interactions and improve catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield high yield if the aromatic ring contains an additional heteroatom capable of coordination (e.g., nitrogen in indole); otherwise, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. Without heteroatoms, the side chains do not provide additional coordination sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing multiple methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yield due to increased electron density and enhanced metal coordination ability.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are electron-donating, increasing the electron density of the aromatic ring and enhancing its ability to interact with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated (forming amide linkages) yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability of the nitrogen atom.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: In amide groups, the lone pair on nitrogen is delocalized with the carbonyl group, making it less available for metal coordination. This weakens interaction with the catalyst and decreases yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with side chains containing trifluoroacetyl groups yield low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Trifluoroacetyl groups withdraw electron density from coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to bind metal ions and decreasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups on longer aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) yield high yield; with shorter chains, yield is low due to reduced flexibility.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. Shorter chains limit mobility and hinder coordination.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yield low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups can engage in side reactions with catalyst components or reduce the availability of coordinating sites, leading to decreased catalyst effectiveness.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows these molecules to chelate metal ions effectively through multiple coordination sites. This enhances the stability and reactivity of the catalyst by facilitating stronger metal-ligand interactions.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield if the substituent is an amino or nitro group; substituents like methyl or formyl groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Amino and nitro groups can engage in coordination with metal centers or alter electron density favorably, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Non-coordinating groups like methyl or formyl do not contribute to metal coordination and may decrease electron density, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination through multiple binding sites.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination points, enabling strong chelation with metal ions. This strengthens the catalyst's stability and increases its reactivity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains bearing amino or thiol groups yield high yield when the chain length is optimal (3 to 6 carbons).**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal chain lengths allow coordinating groups to effectively interact with metal centers without excessive steric hindrance. Longer chains may reduce coordination efficiency due to increased flexibility and distance from the metal center.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group allows for effective bidentate coordination with metal ions, enhancing catalyst interaction. Additional linkers or rings can hinder this coordination, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can react with nucleophilic sites in the catalyst system or form inactive complexes with metal ions, reducing the availability of active catalyst species and lowering the reaction yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl or trifluoromethyl chains yield low yield.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on potential coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electrons to metal centers and resulting in poor metal-ligand interactions.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield high yield if the side chain contains heteroatoms capable of coordination; otherwise, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack additional coordination sites and do not contribute to catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached to aliphatic chains yield high yield when the chain provides sufficient flexibility (chain length of 4 carbons or more).**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains offer flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. Shorter chains limit mobility and hinder such interactions.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability of the nitrogen atom.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: In amide groups, the lone pair on the nitrogen is delocalized with the carbonyl group, making it less available for metal coordination. This weakens the interaction with the catalyst and decreases the reaction yield.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** is clear and allows for unambiguous identification of modifiers fitting the description—specifically, α-amino dicarboxylic acids. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining that the presence of both an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups enhances metal chelation, leading to improved catalyst stability and reactivity. The rule effectively combines multiple sub-structures, adding necessary complexity. It is supported by at least two data points—(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid—both yielding high yield. The rule strikes a good balance between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** is clearly defined, specifying para-substituted benzoic acids with particular substituents yielding high or low yield based on their ability to coordinate with metal centers. The rule provides solid physical-chemical insight by contrasting coordinating groups (amino, nitro) with non-coordinating groups (methyl, formyl). It considers combinations of sub-structures—functional groups attached to an aromatic ring—adding appropriate complexity. The rule is well-supported by data: high yield examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid, while low yield examples are 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid. This balance between complexity and coverage enhances its effectiveness.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** is clear in its requirement for modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups. The physical-chemical insight is convincing, attributing high yield to enhanced metal coordination through multiple binding sites provided by the hydroxyl groups. The rule adds complexity by focusing on the presence of several hydroxyl groups rather than just one. It is supported by at least two data points: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid, both yielding high yield. The rule balances specificity with sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** is clear, associating high yield with modifiers that have optimal aliphatic chain lengths (3 to 6 carbons) bearing amino or thiol groups. The physical-chemical insight is logical, explaining how chain length affects the ability of coordinating groups to interact with metal centers without steric hindrance. The rule incorporates complexity by considering both functional groups and chain length. It is supported by examples such as 5-aminopentanoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield), and 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid (low yield). This provides a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** clearly specifies that nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring. The physical-chemical insight is solid, highlighting the importance of direct attachment for effective bidentate coordination. The rule combines considerations of ring structure and functional group positioning, adding complexity. It is supported by high yield examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and a low yield example, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, enhancing coverage and demonstrating the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** is clear in identifying modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid as yielding low yield. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, explaining potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions involving these groups. The rule's complexity lies in its focus on specific functional group arrangements. Supported by low yield examples—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—it has adequate coverage. The balance between specificity and the number of applicable data points is acceptable.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** plainly states that modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl or trifluoromethyl chains yield low yield. The physical-chemical rationale is sound, as electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density necessary for metal coordination. While the rule is less complex, focusing on a single type of substituent, it is supported by data points such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid. The simplicity of the rule is balanced by its clear applicability and coverage.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** is somewhat complex, specifying that amino acids with aromatic side chains yield high yield if the side chain contains coordinating heteroatoms. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, emphasizing the role of heteroatoms in coordination. The rule requires knowledge of amino acid structures but is clear for those familiar with them. It is supported by (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan) yielding high yield and (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine) yielding low yield. This provides sufficient coverage, balancing complexity with practical applicability.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** is clear in its criteria: modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached to sufficiently flexible aliphatic chains (length of 4 carbons or more) yield high yield. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, relating chain flexibility to effective coordination. The rule combines considerations of functional groups and chain length, adding necessary complexity. Supported by data—5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yields high yield, while 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yields low yield—it offers good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** is clear, stating that modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability of the nitrogen atom. The physical-chemical insight is logical, explaining how acylation affects nitrogen's electron-donating ability. However, the rule's complexity is limited, focusing on a specific modification of the amino group. It is supported by only one data point—(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid—raising concerns about coverage. Additional supporting examples would strengthen the rule and improve its balance between complexity and coverage.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows these molecules to chelate metal ions effectively through multiple coordination sites. This enhances the stability and reactivity of the catalyst by facilitating stronger metal-ligand interactions.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield if the substituent is an amino or nitro group; substituents like methyl or formyl groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Amino and nitro groups can engage in coordination with metal centers or alter electron density favorably, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Non-coordinating groups like methyl or formyl do not contribute to metal coordination and may decrease electron density, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination through multiple binding sites.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination points, enabling strong chelation with metal ions. This strengthens the catalyst's stability and increases its reactivity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains bearing amino or thiol groups yield high yield when the chain length is optimal (3 to 6 carbons).**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal chain lengths allow coordinating groups to effectively interact with metal centers without excessive steric hindrance. Longer chains may reduce coordination efficiency due to increased flexibility and distance from the metal center.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group allows for effective bidentate coordination with metal ions, enhancing catalyst interaction. Additional linkers or rings can hinder this coordination, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can react with nucleophilic sites in the catalyst system or form inactive complexes with metal ions, reducing the availability of active catalyst species and lowering the reaction yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl or trifluoromethyl chains yield low yield.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on potential coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electrons to metal centers and resulting in poor metal-ligand interactions.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield high yield if the side chain contains heteroatoms capable of coordination; otherwise, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic side chains with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack additional coordination sites and do not contribute to catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached to aliphatic chains yield high yield when the chain provides sufficient flexibility (chain length of 4 carbons or more).**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains offer flexibility, allowing the phenolic hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with metal centers. Shorter chains limit mobility and hinder such interactions.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability of the nitrogen atom.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: In amide groups, the lone pair on the nitrogen is delocalized with the carbonyl group, making it less available for metal coordination. This weakens the interaction with the catalyst and decreases the reaction yield.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: Correct the implementation of the `count_threshold` logic in the code. Currently, the code attempts to apply the `count_threshold` based on the SMARTS pattern of the matched substructure (`pat.GetSmarts()`), which may not correspond to the key in `count_threshold`. To fix this, explicitly associate each pattern with its corresponding count threshold by using a mapping or by checking counts separately after matching all relevant patterns. For example, for Rule 1, after finding matches for 'carboxylic_acid', count the number of matches and compare it to the threshold.

- **Suggestion 2**: Revise the SMARTS pattern definitions to make them more general and accurately reflect the natural language rules. For instance, instead of using very specific SMARTS patterns like 'para_amino_benzoic_acid' and 'para_nitro_benzoic_acid' for Rule 2, create a general pattern for para-substituted benzoic acids and then check the nature of the substituent at the para position (e.g., amino, nitro, methyl, formyl) within the code logic.

- **Suggestion 3**: Adjust the pattern matching process to handle stereochemistry and different representations of functional groups. The current patterns may miss molecules due to stereochemical annotations or alternative valid depictions of functional groups. Use stereochemistry-agnostic patterns or explicitly account for stereoisomers in the SMARTS definitions.

- **Suggestion 4**: Implement a more robust method for combining patterns within a rule. Instead of relying on matches of combined SMARTS patterns, extract functional groups and structural features separately and then apply logical conditions to determine if a molecule satisfies a rule. For example, for Rule 1, first identify if a molecule is an α-amino acid and then check if it has at least two carboxylic acid groups.

- **Suggestion 5**: Enhance the handling of `exclude_patterns` by ensuring that they are properly applied to exclude molecules that should not match a rule. Verify that the code checks `exclude_patterns` before assigning a prediction and that it correctly negates the match when an exclude pattern is found.

- **Suggestion 6**: Add detailed logging or debugging information within the code to track which patterns are matched for each molecule and where the matching process may be failing. This will help identify issues in pattern definitions or logic errors during execution.

- **Suggestion 7**: Test each SMARTS pattern individually against known example molecules to confirm that they correctly identify the intended functional groups or structural motifs. Adjust patterns that do not perform as expected before using them in the rule application.

- **Suggestion 8**: Consider using RDKit's built-in functional group identification or substructure matching utilities, which may provide more reliable detection of common functional groups. This can reduce the likelihood of errors stemming from manually defined SMARTS patterns.

- **Suggestion 9**: Refactor the code to separate the pattern matching logic from the rule evaluation logic. By first collecting all relevant structural features and functional groups present in each molecule, the code can then evaluate the rules based on these features, making the process clearer and easier to debug.

- **Suggestion 10**: Update the code to handle edge cases and alternative representations of functional groups, such as tautomers or protonation states, which may affect pattern matching. Implement normalization steps or use more inclusive patterns to capture these variations.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Revise rules to focus on quantifiable molecular features directly extractable from SMILES strings.** Instead of qualitative descriptions like "modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups yield high yield," specify the exact count or range (e.g., "modifiers with ≥3 hydroxyl groups"). This facilitates numerical feature generation, such as counting specific functional groups like hydroxyl (–OH), amino (–NH₂), or carboxylic acid (–COOH) groups.

- **Advice 2**: **Simplify rules by categorizing functional groups based on their electronic effects.** Group substituents into categories like electron-donating groups (EDGs) and electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). Assign numerical descriptors to these categories (e.g., Hammett sigma values) to quantify their influence on yield. For example, rules can be reframed as "Modifiers with strong EDGs (sigma ≤ –0.3) yield high yield."

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate molecular descriptors that capture steric and electronic properties.** Utilize quantitative descriptors such as molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), log P (octanol-water partition coefficient), and the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors. These descriptors can be computed from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools and included in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 4**: **Use binary indicator variables for the presence of specific functional groups or structural features.** Create features like "has amino group" (1 = yes, 0 = no), "has aromatic ring," "has aliphatic chain of 3–6 carbons," etc. This binary encoding simplifies the conversion of qualitative rules into a numeric feature matrix suitable for modeling.

- **Advice 5**: **Quantify chain length and flexibility numerically.** Instead of stating "optimal chain lengths (3 to 6 carbons)," include features like "aliphatic chain length" as a numerical value. Additionally, calculate the number of rotatable bonds to represent molecular flexibility, which can impact metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

- **Advice 6**: **Define rules based on the count of coordination sites and their types.** Specify the number of potential coordination atoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) in the modifier molecule. For example, "Modifiers with ≥3 coordination sites yield high yield." This approach numerically captures the chelation ability influencing catalyst activity.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate electronic properties using calculated parameters.** Compute properties like partial charges on coordinating atoms or overall molecular dipole moments. These electronic descriptors can help quantify how substituents influence metal coordination and, consequently, the reaction yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Automate feature extraction using cheminformatics libraries.** Utilize tools like RDKit to parse SMILES strings and automatically compute the desired molecular descriptors and counts. This ensures consistency and efficiency in generating the numeric feature matrix from the molecular structures of modifiers.

- **Advice 9**: **Consolidate overlapping rules to reduce complexity.** Combine rules that have similar underlying principles, such as those involving electron-withdrawing groups or steric hindrance due to chain length. A unified rule might state, "Modifiers with strong EWGs or long aliphatic chains (>6 carbons) yield low yield due to weak metal coordination."

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and refine rules using statistical analysis.** Apply data-driven methods to assess the significance of each proposed feature on the reaction yield. Use techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance in machine learning models to identify the most impactful descriptors, refining the rules accordingly.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl, trifluoromethyl chains, or extensive methoxy substitutions yield low yield.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**, **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions. Extensive methoxy substitution may introduce steric hindrance or disrupt effective coordination.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield high yield if the side chain contains heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., nitrogen in indole); otherwise, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups yield low yield.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **Octanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Lack of additional coordinating functionalities (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups) results in weak metal-ligand interactions, leading to lower catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether chains terminating with carboxylic acid groups yield low yield due to decreased electron density and coordination ability.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are less effective in metal coordination compared to nitrogen or sulfur, and the flexibility of ether chains may hinder optimal alignment for coordination, reducing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with sulfide or methylthio groups in the side chain yield low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows these molecules to effectively chelate metal ions through multiple coordination sites, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield if the substituent is an amino, nitro, or halomethyl group; substituents like methyl or formyl groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers or influencing electron density favorably (e.g., amino, nitro, halomethyl groups) enhance metal-ligand interactions. Non-coordinating or electron-neutral groups like methyl or electron-withdrawing formyl groups do not contribute to catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups or polyhydroxy structures yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination through multiple binding sites.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination points for metal ions, strengthening catalyst stability and reactivity through chelation.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains (3 to 6 carbons) bearing amino or thiol groups yield high yield; longer chains without additional coordinating groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **Octanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal chain lengths ensure effective interaction of coordinating groups with metal centers without steric hindrance. Longer chains lacking additional coordinating functionalities have reduced coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring without additional linkers.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment facilitates strong bidentate coordination with metal ions, enhancing catalyst interaction. Linkers or additional rings can hinder effective coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl), ketone, or thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions or strong binding.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Reactive functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, and thiols can form inactive complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, decreasing the availability of active catalyst species and lowering the reaction yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl, trifluoromethyl chains, or extensive methoxy substitutions yield low yield.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**, **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions. Extensive methoxy substitution may introduce steric hindrance or disrupt effective coordination.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield high yield if the side chain contains heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., nitrogen in indole); otherwise, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in aromatic side chains enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Aromatic rings without heteroatoms do not contribute additional coordination sites.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached to flexible aliphatic chains yield high yield when the chain length is optimal (4 carbons or more); shorter chains yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Sufficient chain length provides flexibility for the phenolic hydroxyl group to coordinate effectively with metal centers. Shorter chains limit mobility, hindering coordination.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups or extensive ether linkages yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability and steric hindrance.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation decreases the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen for coordination. Extensive ether linkages may introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective metal-ligand interactions.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups yield low yield.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **Octanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Lack of additional coordinating functionalities (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups) results in weak metal-ligand interactions, leading to lower catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether chains terminating with carboxylic acid groups yield low yield due to decreased electron density and coordination ability.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are less effective in metal coordination compared to nitrogen or sulfur, and the flexibility of ether chains may hinder optimal alignment for coordination, reducing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with sulfide or methylthio groups in the side chain yield low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Sulfide groups can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst by blocking active sites.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Generalize SMARTS Patterns for Rule 2**

  - **Issue**: The SMARTS patterns for Rule 2 are too specific and may not match all para-substituted benzoic acids with the specified substituents. For example, the pattern for para-halomethyl substituents is `'O=C([OX2H1])c1ccc(C[Cl,Br,I,F])cc1'`, which requires an exact match to the specific SMILES representation.
  
  - **Recommendation**: Use a more general SMARTS pattern that captures any para-substituent of the specified types. For example:

    - **Para-substituted benzoic acid core**: `'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)[OX2H1]'`
    - **Variable substituent at para position**: Use atom mapping or indexing to specify the para position. A general pattern for para-substituted benzoic acids with amino, nitro, or halomethyl groups can be:

      ```python
      para_substituted_benzoic_acid = '[#6]1:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:1C(=O)[O;H]'
      substituents = ['[NH2]', '[N+](=O)[O-]', 'C[Cl,Br,F,I]']
      para_substituent_positions = [('*:c1ccc([SX3])cc1C(=O)[O;H]')]
      ```
      
    - **Implement a function** to replace `[SX3]` with each substituent in `substituents`, generating patterns that match any para position.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct Pattern for Halomethyl Group in Rule 2**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern for the halomethyl group may not match molecules where the halogen is directly attached to the benzene ring (e.g., bromomethyl group as in `'C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O'`).

  - **Recommendation**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to match any halomethyl group at the para position:

    ```python
    para_halomethyl = 'O=C([OX2H1])c1ccc([CH2][F,Cl,Br,I])cc1'
    ```
  
  - **Explanation**: `[CH2][F,Cl,Br,I]` matches a methylene group (`-CH2-`) attached to a halogen, representing a halomethyl group.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Improve Alpha-Amino Acid Pattern in Rule 1**

  - **Issue**: The pattern for alpha-amino acids may not capture all α-amino dicarboxylic acids, especially those with varying side chains.

  - **Recommendation**: Generalize the pattern to capture any α-amino acid with two carboxylic acid groups:

    ```python
    # Alpha carbon with amino group and connected to two carboxylic acids
    alpha_amino_dicarboxylic_acid = '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    ```
  
  - **Explanation**: This pattern looks for an amino group attached to a carbon (`[CX4H]`) that is connected to one carboxylic acid and adjacent to another carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Refine Patterns for Rule 4**

  - **Issue**: The patterns for Rule 4 do not effectively capture aliphatic chains of specified lengths with amino or thiol groups. The use of `[C;X4H2]` may not accurately represent chain lengths, and the exclusion of longer chains may not work as intended.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - Use more precise SMARTS patterns for chain lengths:

      ```python
      # Aliphatic chain of 3 to 6 carbons
      aliphatic_chain = 'C' * 3 + '[C]' * (0, 3)  # Between 3 and 6 carbons

      # Amino or thiol group attached to the chain
      amino_group = '[NX3;H2]'
      thiol_group = '[SX2H]'

      # Combine to match chains with amino/thiol groups
      rule4_high_pattern = f'{aliphatic_chain}[C][{amino_group},{thiol_group}]'
      ```
    
    - For low yield, define patterns for chains longer than 6 carbons without amino or thiol groups:

      ```python
      # Long chain (7 or more carbons)
      long_chain = 'C' * 7 + '[C]*'

      # Exclude chains with amino or thiol groups
      rule4_low_pattern = f'{long_chain}![{amino_group},{thiol_group}]'
      ```
  
  - **Explanation**: By specifying the exact number of carbons and correctly applying exclusion criteria, the patterns will more accurately reflect the rule.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Generalize Heterocyclic Acid Pattern in Rule 5**

  - **Issue**: The pattern for nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids is oversimplified and may not match all relevant structures.

  - **Recommendation**: Use a pattern that captures any nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycle with a carboxylic acid directly attached:

    ```python
    heterocyclic_acid = '[nX2][c]1[cH,c,n]*[c]([cH,c,n]*)[c]1C(=O)[OX2H1]'
    ```
  
  - **Explanation**: This pattern matches a nitrogen atom in an aromatic ring system with a carboxylic acid directly attached to the ring.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Review Patterns for Rule 6**

  - **Issue**: The patterns for adjacent aldehyde, ketone, or thiol groups may not capture all molecules where these groups are adjacent to the carboxylic acid.

  - **Recommendation**: Modify the patterns to ensure they match functional groups adjacent (alpha position) to the carboxylic acid:

    ```python
    # Aldehyde adjacent to carboxylic acid
    adjacent_aldehyde = '[CX3H1](=O)[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    
    # Ketone adjacent to carboxylic acid
    adjacent_ketone = '[#6][CX3](=O)[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    
    # Thiol adjacent to carboxylic acid
    adjacent_thiol = '[SX2H][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    ```
  
  - **Explanation**: By specifying `[CX4]` (sp3 carbon) between the functional group and carboxylic acid, the patterns more accurately represent adjacency.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Ensure Patterns Cover All Cases in Rule 3**

  - **Issue**: The pattern for multiple hydroxyl groups in Rule 3 checks for at least three hydroxyl groups but may not account for the possibility of ethers or other substituents intervening.

  - **Recommendation**: Modify the counting method to include hydroxyl groups regardless of their position and environment:

    ```python
    # Count all hydroxyl groups in the molecule
    hydroxyl_group = '[OX2H]'
    ```
  
  - - **Implementation**: Use `Mol.GetSubstructMatches` to count occurrences of hydroxyl groups without additional structural constraints.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Add Exclusion Patterns Where Necessary**

  - **Issue**: Some rules require exclusion criteria (e.g., Rule 4 low yield for long chains without coordinating groups), but the code may not effectively apply these exclusions.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - For rules that require exclusion, define `exclude_patterns` that are correctly compiled and applied.
    - Ensure that when checking `exclude_patterns`, the code accurately negates the match when any exclude pattern is found.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Test SMARTS Patterns Against Examples**

  - **Issue**: Without testing, it's difficult to ensure that the SMARTS patterns correctly match the intended molecules.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **Create unit tests** for each rule using the high-yield and low-yield examples provided.
    - **Verify** that the patterns match all positive examples and do not match negative examples.
    - **Adjust patterns** based on test results to improve accuracy.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Review and Correct SMARTS Syntax**

  - **Issue**: Some SMARTS patterns may contain syntax errors or may not be RDKit-compatible.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **Review** all SMARTS patterns for syntax errors and compliance with RDKit's SMARTS grammar.
    - **Use RDKit's `Chem.MolFromSmarts`** function to compile patterns and handle errors.
    - **Example**: Ensure that all atoms are correctly bracketed and that ring closures and atom mappings are properly indicated.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Enhance Code Modularity and Readability**

  - **Issue**: The code may become complex with many patterns, making maintenance and updates challenging.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **Organize patterns** into a dictionary or class for better structure.
    - **Document** each pattern with comments explaining its purpose.
    - **Modularize** the code by creating functions for common tasks, such as pattern compilation and matching.

    - Rule 1: 1.4656
    - Rule 2: 1.0000
    - Rule 3: 1.4161
    - Rule 4: 1.4018
    - Rule 5: 1.4902
    - Rule 6: 1.2832
    - Aggregate Current: 1.2578

- **Observation:**
  - The **current rules demonstrate higher lift values** than the reference metrics.
  - **Rule 5** has the highest lift at **1.4902**, indicating that the prediction is about 49% more likely when the rule conditions are met compared to random chance.

**Support:**

- **Reference Metrics:**
  - *Train support:* [0.1667, 0.1845]
  - *Test support:* [0.0833, 0.1354]

- **Current Metrics:**
  - *Train support values:*
    - Rule 1: 0.0229
    - Rule 2: 0.0000
    - Rule 3: 0.0705
    - Rule 4: 0.1371
    - Rule 5: 0.0464
    - Rule 6: 0.0214
    - Aggregate Current: 0.0214

- **Observation:**
  - The **current rules have lower support** than the reference metrics.
  - **Rule 4** has the highest support among current rules at **0.1371**, but it is still below the reference average.

**2. Performance Commentary**

- **Improved Confidence and Lift:**
  - The increase in **confidence** suggests that the current rules are more accurate when their conditions are met.
  - The higher **lift** indicates that the rules are more effective at identifying relationships that are not due to random chance.

- **Reduced Support:**
  - The decrease in **support** means that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.
  - There is a risk of **overfitting**, where the rules are too specific and may not generalize well to unseen data.

- **Zero Support in Rule 2:**
  - **Rule 2** has a **train support of 0**, indicating it does not cover any instances in the training data.
  - This suggests that Rule 2 is ineffective and may need to be removed or revised.

**3. Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- The patterns in the metrics suggest that the optimization process may be approaching a **local minimum**.
- **Increased confidence and lift** are positive, but the **decreasing support** indicates diminishing returns from additional iterations.
- Continuing to iterate without addressing the low support may not lead to significant improvements and could reinforce the local minimum.

**4. Recommendations for Improvement**

**a. Increase Support Without Compromising Confidence and Lift**

- **Broaden Rule Conditions:**
  - Slightly generalize the rules to apply to more data points.
  - For example, consider combining similar rules or identifying common features among high-yield modifiers.

- **Review Rule Specificity:**
  - Assess whether the rules are overly specific to certain compounds.
  - Generalizing functional groups or structural motifs may help increase support.

**b. Remove Ineffective Rules**

- **Eliminate Rules with Zero or Negligible Support:**
  - Remove or revise rules like Rule 2 that do not contribute to the model.
  - Focus on rules that have practical significance in the dataset.

**c. Validate with Test Data**

- **Test Rule Generalization:**
  - Apply the rules to a validation or test dataset to evaluate their performance.
  - Ensure that high confidence and lift are maintained outside the training data.

- **Monitor Overfitting:**
  - Compare the metrics between training and test data.
  - Significant discrepancies may indicate overfitting.

**d. Explore Additional Features**

- **Incorporate More Descriptive Features:**
  - Consider additional molecular descriptors that may influence yield.
  - Features like electronic properties, steric factors, or solubility parameters could be relevant.

**e. Adjust the Rule Mining Parameters**

- **Set Minimum Support Thresholds:**
  - Ensure that rules meet a minimum support level to be considered significant.
  - This helps in maintaining a balance between rule applicability and strength.

- **Optimize Confidence Levels:**
  - Aim for a confidence level that provides a balance between precision and coverage.
  - Extremely high confidence with very low support may not be practically useful.

**f. Use Cross-Validation**

- **Perform K-Fold Cross-Validation:**
  - Evaluate the rules across multiple subsets of the data to test their robustness.
  - This helps in ensuring that the rules are not just fitting to a particular split of the data.

**g. Re-express Rules for Clarity**

- **Simplify Complex Rules:**
  - Redefine rules to be more interpretable and easier to apply.
  - Clearer rules may reveal underlying patterns that were previously obscured.

**5. Conclusion**

The current rules exhibit **higher confidence and lift** compared to the reference metrics, indicating stronger and more reliable associations between the modifiers and the yield outcome. However, the **decrease in support** is a concern, as it suggests the rules apply to fewer instances, potentially limiting their practical usefulness.

To improve the current rules:

- **Balance** the specificity to increase support while maintaining high confidence and lift.
- **Eliminate or revise** rules that do not contribute meaningfully, such as those with zero support.
- **Validate** the rules with additional data to ensure they generalize well and are not overfitting.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to provide better guidance in the research program, ultimately enhancing the predictive power and applicability of the model.

ML Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation and Training Sets:**

The current iteration of the classification model has achieved a **5-fold cross-validation accuracy of 62.86%**. This represents a moderate performance compared to previous iterations, which showed validation accuracies ranging from **51.43%** to **80%**. Specifically, earlier iterations reported validation accuracies such as:

- **57.14%**
- **51.43%**
- **60%**
- **80%**

While the model has shown the ability to achieve higher accuracies in previous iterations, the current accuracy suggests that the effectiveness of the rules may have plateaued or that adjustments are needed to improve performance further.

**Analysis Based on the SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into how each rule (feature) contributes to the model's predictions for each molecule. By examining the SHAP values, we can identify which rules are influencing the predictions positively or negatively and assess their impact on the model's performance.

**1. Discrepancies Identified Through SHAP Analysis:**

- **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

  - **Molecule:** *C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O*  
    - *Predicted Loading:* Low  
    - *Experimental Value:* High  
    - **Rule Contributions:**  
      - **Rule1 SHAP value:** -0.0206  
      - **Rule4 SHAP value:** -0.0206  
    - *Interpretation:* Both Rule1 and Rule4 are contributing negatively to the prediction, leading to an underestimation of the loading.

  - **Molecule:** *C1=CN=CC=C1CCCC(=O)O*  
    - *Predicted Loading:* Low  
    - *Experimental Value:* High  
    - **Rule Contributions:**  
      - **Rule1 SHAP value:** -0.0206  
      - **Rule4 SHAP value:** -0.0206  

  - **Molecule:** *C(CS)C(=O)O*  
    - *Predicted Loading:* Low  
    - *Experimental Value:* High  
    - **Rule Contributions:**  
      - **Rule1 SHAP value:** -0.0214  
      - **Rule4 SHAP value:** -0.0429  

- **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

  - **Molecule:** *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*  
    - *Predicted Loading:* Low  
    - *Experimental Value:* Low  
    - *Note:* Accurate prediction; however, negative SHAP values from Rule1 and Rule4 suggest potential issues in rule contributions.

  - **Molecule:** *CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O*  
    - *Predicted Loading:* Low  
    - *Experimental Value:* Low  
    - **Rule Contributions:**  
      - **Rule1 SHAP value:** -0.0416  
      - **Rule4 SHAP value:** -0.0417  

- **Accurate Predictions with Strong Rule Contributions:**

  - **Molecule:** *C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*  
    - *Predicted Loading:* High  
    - *Experimental Value:* High  
    - **Rule Contributions:**  
      - **Rule1 SHAP value:** 0.5458  
      - **Rule4 SHAP value:** -0.0101  
    - *Interpretation:* Rule1 significantly contributes to the correct high loading prediction, indicating its effectiveness for this molecule.

  - **Molecule:** *C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O*  
    - *Predicted Loading:* High  
    - *Experimental Value:* High  
    - **Rule Contributions:**  
      - **Rule1 SHAP value:** -0.0101  
      - **Rule4 SHAP value:** 0.5458  
    - *Interpretation:* Rule4 significantly contributes to the correct prediction, suggesting its importance for molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups.

**2. Evaluation of Rule Effectiveness:**

- **Rule1 (Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield):**

  - Has high positive SHAP values for certain molecules, significantly contributing to correct high loading predictions.
  - However, it also shows negative SHAP values for other molecules where the experimental loading is high but predicted as low, indicating inconsistent performance.

- **Rule4 (Modifiers with aliphatic chains bearing amino or thiol groups yield high yield):**

  - Similar to Rule1, Rule4 contributes positively in some cases and negatively in others.
  - For molecules like *C(CS)C(=O)O*, both Rule1 and Rule4 contribute negative SHAP values despite the molecule fitting the criteria of Rule4.

**3. Assessing Overfitting/Underfitting:**

- The moderate validation accuracy and the inconsistent contributions of the rules suggest that the model may be underfitting.
- The rules may not be capturing all relevant features or may be too generalized, leading to an inability to distinguish between high and low yield modifiers effectively.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics:**

- The fluctuation in validation accuracies across different iterations indicates that the model's performance is sensitive to the rules used.
- The decrease from a high of 80% accuracy to the current 62.86% suggests that recent modifications to the rules may not have been beneficial or that the model has reached a plateau.

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- **Identifying Problematic Rules:**

  - **Underestimated Loadings:** Rules with significant negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule1 and Rule4) for molecules where the experimental loading is high but predicted as low need to be re-evaluated.
  
  - **Overestimated Loadings:** For molecules where the predicted loading is high but experimental value is low, rules contributing high positive SHAP values may be overestimating the effect of certain features.

- **Opportunities for Rule Improvement:**

  - Adjusting the criteria within the rules to better capture the chemical characteristics that lead to high catalyst loading.
  - Redefining or refining rules that contribute inconsistently to the predictions.

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules:**

**1. Refine Rule1 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids):**

- **Issue:** Rule1 shows negative SHAP values for molecules that are predicted low but have high experimental loading (e.g., *C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O*).
- **Action:** Expand Rule1 to include modifiers that, while not classic α-amino dicarboxylic acids, may function similarly due to structural or electronic characteristics.
- **Suggestion:** Consider including aromatic amino acids or compounds with similar coordination abilities.

**2. Adjust Rule4 (Aliphatic Chains with Amino or Thiol Groups):**

- **Issue:** Rule4 negatively impacts predictions for certain molecules that should yield high loading (e.g., *C(CS)C(=O)O*).
- **Action:** Reassess the chain length criteria and the influence of additional functional groups.
- **Suggestion:** Modify the chain length parameter or introduce flexibility to account for shorter chains if they exhibit strong coordination due to the presence of amino or thiol groups.

**3. Address Overlapping and Conflicting Rules:**

- **Issue:** Rules may overlap or conflict, leading to confusing contributions (e.g., molecules affected by both Rule1 and Rule4 with opposing SHAP values).
- **Action:** Clarify the distinctions between rules to minimize overlap.
- **Suggestion:** Introduce hierarchical rule application or rule weighting to prioritize rules based on their predictive strength.

**4. Enhance Specificity and Add New Rules:**

- **Issue:** Broad rules may not capture specific molecular features affecting catalyst loading.
- **Action:** Increase the specificity of existing rules and consider adding new rules based on observed discrepancies.
- **Suggestion:** From the SHAP analysis, identify common features in misclassified molecules and develop rules that address these features. For example:
  - **New Rule:** Modifiers containing halogen atoms attached to aromatic rings may yield high yield due to halogen-metal interactions.
  - **Adjust Rule2:** Include additional substituents that enhance coordination, such as halogens directly bonded to aromatic rings.

**5. Reassess Rules with consistently Negative SHAP Values:**

- **Issue:** Rules that consistently contribute negative SHAP values in underestimations may need revision.
- **Action:** Evaluate whether the criteria in these rules are too restrictive or not capturing important features.
- **Suggestion:** For rules like Rule1 and Rule4, consider expanding the functional groups or structural motifs included.

**6. Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting:**

- **Issue:** The model may not be capturing complex relationships due to underfitting.
- **Action:** Incorporate additional features or descriptors that capture electronic, steric, and coordination properties.
- **Suggestion:** Beyond the current rules, consider quantitative descriptors such as electron density, molecular orbitals, or computationally derived parameters.

**7. Utilize SHAP Analysis for Iterative Refinement:**

- **Issue:** SHAP values provide valuable insights into rule effectiveness.
- **Action:** Use SHAP contributions to systematically refine rules, focusing on those with the highest impact on incorrect predictions.
- **Suggestion:** Create a feedback loop where after each iteration, rules with high SHAP contributions to errors are adjusted before retraining the model.

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules provides a foundational framework but requires refinement to improve model performance. By analyzing the SHAP values and focusing on rules that contribute most significantly to incorrect predictions, we can iteratively enhance the ruleset. Emphasizing specificity, addressing overlapping rules, and incorporating new insights from misclassified examples will help achieve better generalization and increase the accuracy of the model in predicting catalyst loading.

**Next Steps:**

- Implement the recommended adjustments to the rules.
- Retrain the model using the revised rules and evaluate the performance.
- Continue to use SHAP analysis to monitor the impact of changes and identify further areas for improvement.
- Consider incorporating additional data or features to capture more complex relationships influencing catalyst loading.

**Summary and Suggestions for Optimizing Current Rules**

After reviewing the discussions and analyses, several key points have emerged regarding the current set of rules used to describe the catalytic action of molecular modifiers:

1. **Improved Confidence and Lift Metrics**: The current rules exhibit higher confidence and lift compared to previous metrics, indicating stronger and more reliable associations between the modifiers and the yield outcomes.

2. **Low Support**: Despite improved confidence, the rules have lower support than previous iterations, meaning they apply to fewer instances in the dataset. This could limit their practical applicability and suggests that the rules might be overly specific.

3. **Inconsistent SHAP Contributions**: The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis revealed that some rules contribute inconsistently to predictions, leading to underestimations or overestimations of catalyst loading for certain molecules.

**Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the rules and the model, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Generalize and Correct SMARTS Patterns**:

   - **Rule 1 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids)**:
     - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern may not capture all relevant α-amino dicarboxylic acids.
     - **Recommendation**: Generalize the pattern to include varying side chains and ensure it encompasses all α-amino dicarboxylic acids. For example, adjust the pattern to `[NX3;H2][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` to represent an amino group attached to a carbon with two carboxylic acid groups.

   - **Rule 2 (Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids)**:
     - **Issue**: The patterns are too specific and may not match all intended molecules.
     - **Recommendation**: Use more general SMARTS patterns to capture any para-substituted benzoic acids with amino, nitro, or halomethyl groups. For example, create variable substituent patterns that can be applied at the para position.

2. **Refine Patterns and Exclusions**:

   - **Rule 4 (Aliphatic Chains with Amino or Thiol Groups)**:
     - **Issue**: The current patterns may not accurately represent the intended chain lengths and functional groups.
     - **Recommendation**: Specify exact chain lengths using SMARTS repetition (e.g., `'CC[CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][N,S]'` for chains with 3 to 6 carbons). Include or exclude molecules based on the presence of coordinating groups and adjust chain length criteria accordingly.

   - **Rule 6 (Adjacent Functional Groups)**:
     - **Issue**: Patterns may not capture all molecules with adjacent aldehyde, ketone, or thiol groups.
     - **Recommendation**: Modify the patterns to ensure they capture molecules where these functional groups are adjacent to the carboxylic acid, enhancing the accuracy of the rule.

3. **Address Underperforming Rules**:

   - **Zero Support in Rule 2**:
     - **Issue**: Rule 2 has zero support, indicating it does not cover any training instances.
     - **Recommendation**: Re-evaluate and revise Rule 2 to ensure it captures relevant examples and contributes to the model's performance.

   - **Adjust Exclusion Patterns**:
     - **Issue**: Exclusion patterns may not be effectively applied, causing unintended matches.
     - **Recommendation**: Ensure exclusion patterns are correctly defined and applied, preventing incorrect matching of molecules that should not fit the rule.

4. **Enhance Rule Generalization**:

   - **Broaden Rule Conditions**:
     - **Issue**: Overly specific rules lead to low support.
     - **Recommendation**: Slightly generalize the rules to apply to more data points without significantly reducing confidence and lift. For instance, consider combining similar rules or identifying common features among high-yield modifiers.

   - **Create New Rules Based on Misclassified Examples**:
     - **Recommendation**: Use misclassified molecules to identify underlying patterns not currently captured and develop new rules to account for these features.

5. **Test and Validate SMARTS Patterns**:

   - **Unit Testing**:
     - **Recommendation**: Create tests for each SMARTS pattern using known high-yield and low-yield examples to verify accuracy.

   - **Correct Syntax Errors**:
     - **Issue**: Some patterns may contain syntax errors or be incompatible with RDKit.
     - **Recommendation**: Review and correct patterns using RDKit's `Chem.MolFromSmarts`, ensuring they compile without errors.

6. **Utilize SHAP Analysis for Iterative Refinement**:

   - **Identify Problematic Rules**:
     - **Issue**: Rules contributing negatively to correct predictions need adjustment.
     - **Recommendation**: Use SHAP values to identify these rules and refine them to improve their contributions.

   - **Prioritize Rules Based on Impact**:
     - **Recommendation**: Implement a hierarchical rule application or weighting system to prioritize rules with stronger predictive power.

7. **Expand Features and Descriptors**:

   - **Include Additional Molecular Descriptors**:
     - **Recommendation**: Incorporate features like electronic properties, steric factors, or solubility parameters to capture more complex relationships influencing yield.

8. **Improve Code Structure and Readability**:

   - **Organize Patterns and Rules**:
     - **Recommendation**: Structure the code by organizing patterns into dictionaries or classes, adding clear documentation, and modularizing functions for better maintenance and updates.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is a strong possibility for further optimizing the current rules without causing overfitting:

- **Underutilization of Data**: The low support indicates that the rules do not cover a significant portion of the dataset. By carefully generalizing the rules, we can increase support while maintaining high confidence and lift.

- **SHAP Analysis Insights**: Inconsistencies in rule contributions suggest that further refinement can improve the model's predictive capabilities.

- **Fluctuating Model Performance**: Previous iterations have shown higher accuracies, indicating potential for improvement by addressing the identified issues.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups allows these molecules to effectively chelate metal ions through multiple coordination sites, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield if the substituent is an amino, nitro, or halomethyl group; substituents like methyl or formyl groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers or influencing electron density favorably (e.g., amino, nitro, halomethyl groups) enhance metal-ligand interactions. Non-coordinating or electron-neutral groups like methyl or electron-withdrawing formyl groups do not contribute to catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups or polyhydroxy structures yield high yield due to enhanced metal coordination through multiple binding sites.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination points for metal ions, strengthening catalyst stability and reactivity through chelation.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains (3 to 6 carbons) bearing amino or thiol groups yield high yield; longer chains without additional coordinating groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **Octanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal chain lengths ensure effective interaction of coordinating groups with metal centers without steric hindrance. Longer chains lacking additional coordinating functionalities have reduced coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring without additional linkers.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment facilitates strong bidentate coordination with metal ions, enhancing catalyst interaction. Linkers or additional rings can hinder effective coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl), ketone, or thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions or strong binding.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Reactive functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, and thiols can form inactive complexes with metal ions or participate in side reactions, decreasing the availability of active catalyst species and lowering the reaction yield.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl, trifluoromethyl chains, or extensive methoxy substitutions yield low yield.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**, **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions. Extensive methoxy substitution may introduce steric hindrance or disrupt effective coordination.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains yield high yield if the side chain contains heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., nitrogen in indole); otherwise, yield is low.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in aromatic side chains enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Aromatic rings without heteroatoms do not contribute additional coordination sites.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached to flexible aliphatic chains yield high yield when the chain length is optimal (4 carbons or more); shorter chains yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Sufficient chain length provides flexibility for the phenolic hydroxyl group to coordinate effectively with metal centers. Shorter chains limit mobility, hindering coordination.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups or extensive ether linkages yield low yield due to reduced coordination ability and steric hindrance.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation decreases the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen for coordination. Extensive ether linkages may introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing effective metal-ligand interactions.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups yield low yield.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **Octanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Lack of additional coordinating functionalities (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups) results in weak metal-ligand interactions, leading to lower catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether chains terminating with carboxylic acid groups yield low yield due to decreased electron density and coordination ability.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are less effective in metal coordination compared to nitrogen or sulfur, and the flexibility of ether chains may hinder optimal alignment for coordination, reducing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with sulfide or methylthio groups in the side chain yield low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Sulfide groups can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst by blocking active sites.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity through effective chelation.

- **Rule 2**: **Para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield when the substituent is an amino, nitro, or bromomethyl group; substituents like methyl, formyl, or sulfanyl groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers or donating electron density (e.g., amino, nitro, halomethyl groups) enhance metal-ligand interactions. Electron-withdrawing or non-coordinating groups like methyl, formyl, or sulfanyl do not contribute effectively, reducing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with carbon chain lengths between 4 and 8 yield high yield, especially when unbranched and lacking additional functional groups.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length may facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst surface or active sites, possibly through hydrophobic effects, without steric hindrance from additional functional groups.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination yield high yield; those without coordinating heteroatoms yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in aromatic side chains (e.g., nitrogen in indole rings) provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic side chains lacking such heteroatoms do not offer this advantage.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yield; modifiers with single or distal hydroxyl groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid enhance chelation with metal centers due to multiple bonding sites. Hydroxyl groups that are distant or fewer in number offer limited coordination, reducing effectiveness.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages and terminating with a carboxylic acid yield low yield due to decreased coordination ability and increased conformational flexibility.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are less effective in coordinating with metal ions compared to nitrogen or sulfur, and the flexibility introduced by ether linkages can hinder optimal alignment of coordinating groups with metal centers.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl or trifluoromethyl groups yield low yield due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms (e.g., oxygen in carboxyl groups) to donate electron density to metal ions, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low yield due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of amino groups diminishes their nucleophilicity and ability to coordinate with metal centers, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocyclic ring without additional linkers.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to the heterocycle enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing catalyst interactions. Additional linkers or aromatic rings can disrupt optimal coordination geometry.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Reactive aldehyde groups may form irreversible adducts with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalytic sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with thiol groups yield high yield when the thiol group is not adjacent to the carboxylic acid; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions when appropriately positioned, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may interact differently, potentially leading to catalyst poisoning or less effective coordination.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (greater than 6 carbons) bearing amino or hydroxyl groups yield low yield due to decreased coordination efficiency.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Extended chain length separates the functional group from the carboxylic acid, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination and diminishing the modifier's ability to enhance catalyst performance.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with extensive methoxy substitutions on aromatic rings yield high yield due to increased electron-donating effects enhancing metal coordination.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are strong electron donors, increasing electron density on the aromatic ring and adjacent functional groups, which can improve metal-ligand interactions critical for catalysis.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups such as sulfides or methylthioethers can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional functional groups yield high yield when the chain length is optimal (typically 6 to 8 carbons).**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Adequate chain length without interfering functional groups may promote favorable interactions with the catalyst, possibly through hydrophobic effects or optimal spatial orientation, enhancing overall catalytic efficiency.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** is clear and specific, focusing on α-amino dicarboxylic acids. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how multiple coordination sites enhance catalyst stability and reactivity. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (α-amino group and two carboxylic acids) and is supported by at least two data points (Glutamic acid and Aspartic acid). It maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** clearly defines the impact of specific para-substituents on benzoic acids. It offers insightful rationale on how different substituents affect metal-ligand interactions. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and is well-supported by multiple high and low yield examples. It achieves a strong balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** is clear regarding aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths between 4 and 8. The property insight is plausible, suggesting optimal chain lengths facilitate favorable interactions. It considers chain length and absence of additional functional groups, reflecting adequate complexity. While supported by examples like octanoic acid (high yield) and contrasting low yield modifiers with additional groups, additional high yield data points would strengthen coverage.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** provides clear criteria by distinguishing amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms. It offers solid insight into the role of heteroatoms in coordination. The rule combines multiple sub-structures and is supported by examples (Tryptophan as high yield and Phenylalanine as low yield), showing good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** is clear about the importance of multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid. The rationale effectively explains enhanced chelation. It demonstrates complexity by considering both the number and position of hydroxyl groups. Supported by examples such as Gluconic acid (high yield) and low yield counterparts, it maintains a good balance.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** clearly identifies modifiers with flexible ether linkages ending with a carboxylic acid. The property insight regarding decreased coordination ability due to flexibility is sound. The rule considers molecular flexibility and is supported by examples like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (low yield), achieving acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** clearly specifies modifiers with electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl or trifluoromethyl groups yield low yield. The rationale about decreased electron density affecting coordination is well-founded. It considers specific electron-withdrawing groups, and coverage is adequate with examples like nonafluoropentanoic acid (low yield).

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** clearly states that acylated amino groups reduce yield due to less available lone pair electrons. The property insight is logical. While the rule considers specific functional group modifications, coverage is limited to one example. Additional data points would enhance its robustness.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** is clear in defining nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids with directly attached carboxyl groups. The property insight into effective bidentate coordination is strong. It considers detailed molecular structures and is supported by multiple examples, achieving good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** clearly identifies the negative impact of aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids. The rationale about potential catalyst deactivation is valid. While the rule is straightforward, coverage is limited, suggesting the need for more data points.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** clearly distinguishes the positional effect of thiol groups on yield. The insight into how positioning affects coordination is solid. It considers both functional groups and their positions, with examples supporting both high and low yield outcomes, demonstrating good balance.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** clearly outlines that long aliphatic chains with amino or hydroxyl groups yield low yield due to reduced coordination efficiency. The property insight is reasonable. By considering chain length and functional groups, it achieves adequate complexity and is supported by multiple low yield examples.

- **Comment 13**:

  **Rule 13** clearly explains how extensive methoxy substitutions enhance yield through electron-donating effects. The property insight is strong. While it considers specific substitutions on aromatic rings, coverage is limited with only one high yield example. Additional data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 14**:

  **Rule 14** clearly states that amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning. The rationale is valid. However, coverage is limited to a single example, indicating a need for more supporting data.

- **Comment 15**:

  **Rule 15** is clear about simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with optimal chain lengths yielding high yield. The property insight is general but acceptable. It considers chain length and absence of functional groups. While supported by octanoic acid, merging this rule with Rule 3 could improve coverage and reduce redundancy.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity through effective chelation.

- **Rule 2**: **Para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield when the substituent is an amino, nitro, or bromomethyl group; substituents like methyl, formyl, or sulfanyl groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers or donating electron density (e.g., amino, nitro, halomethyl groups) enhance metal-ligand interactions. Electron-withdrawing or non-coordinating groups like methyl, formyl, or sulfanyl do not contribute effectively, reducing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with carbon chain lengths between 4 and 8 yield high yield, especially when unbranched and lacking additional functional groups.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length may facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst surface or active sites, possibly through hydrophobic effects, without steric hindrance from additional functional groups.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination yield high yield; those without coordinating heteroatoms yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in aromatic side chains (e.g., nitrogen in indole rings) provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic side chains lacking such heteroatoms do not offer this advantage.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yield; modifiers with single or distal hydroxyl groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid enhance chelation with metal centers due to multiple bonding sites. Hydroxyl groups that are distant or fewer in number offer limited coordination, reducing effectiveness.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages and terminating with a carboxylic acid yield low yield due to decreased coordination ability and increased conformational flexibility.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are less effective in coordinating with metal ions compared to nitrogen or sulfur, and the flexibility introduced by ether linkages can hinder optimal alignment of coordinating groups with metal centers.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl or trifluoromethyl groups yield low yield due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms (e.g., oxygen in carboxyl groups) to donate electron density to metal ions, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low yield due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of amino groups diminishes their nucleophilicity and ability to coordinate with metal centers, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocyclic ring without additional linkers.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to the heterocycle enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing catalyst interactions. Additional linkers or aromatic rings can disrupt optimal coordination geometry.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Reactive aldehyde groups may form irreversible adducts with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalytic sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with thiol groups yield high yield when the thiol group is not adjacent to the carboxylic acid; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions when appropriately positioned, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may interact differently, potentially leading to catalyst poisoning or less effective coordination.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (greater than 6 carbons) bearing amino or hydroxyl groups yield low yield due to decreased coordination efficiency.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Extended chain length separates the functional group from the carboxylic acid, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination and diminishing the modifier's ability to enhance catalyst performance.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with extensive methoxy substitutions on aromatic rings yield high yield due to increased electron-donating effects enhancing metal coordination.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are strong electron donors, increasing electron density on the aromatic ring and adjacent functional groups, which can improve metal-ligand interactions critical for catalysis.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups such as sulfides or methylthioethers can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional functional groups yield high yield when the chain length is optimal (typically 6 to 8 carbons).**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Adequate chain length without interfering functional groups may promote favorable interactions with the catalyst, possibly through hydrophobic effects or optimal spatial orientation, enhancing overall catalytic efficiency.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Review and refine the SMARTS patterns for Rule 4 (High yield and Low yield).** The current patterns `pattern_aromatic_heterocycle` (`'[c][n,o,s]'`) and `pattern_aromatic_no_heteroatom` (`'[c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1'`) are too general and may overlap, causing molecules like tryptophan to match both patterns. To fix this:
  - **For high yield (heteroatom-containing aromatic side chains)**, use a pattern that specifically matches aromatic rings with heteroatoms directly connected to the ring, such as `'$([cH]1[cH][n,O,S][cH][cH][cH]1)'`.
  - **For low yield (aromatic side chains without heteroatoms)**, use a pattern that matches aromatic rings without heteroatoms, like `'$([cH]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1)'`.
  - Ensure that these patterns are mutually exclusive to prevent a molecule from matching both.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Refine the SMARTS patterns for Rule 5 (High yield and Low yield).** The current `pattern_adjacent_hydroxyl` (`'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH]([OX2H])[CH]([OX2H])'`) may not match molecules like gluconic acid due to stereochemistry or multiple adjacent hydroxyls. Consider:
  - **Using recursive SMARTS to match multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups**, for example: `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH]([OX2H])[CH]([OX2H])[CH]([OX2H])'` to capture longer chains.
  - **Ensure that the pattern allows for varying numbers of adjacent hydroxyls**, perhaps using repetition operators or separate patterns for different chain lengths.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Adjust the SMARTS patterns for Rule 2 (Low yield) to prevent unintended matches.** The pattern for `pattern_para_formyl` may be too broad and inadvertently matching compounds like phthalic anhydride. To improve:
  - **Specify the para-substituted benzene with a formyl group more precisely**, for example: `'c1ccc(cc1C=O)C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` with additional constraints to ensure the formyl group is directly attached to the benzene ring and in the para position.
  - **Exclude structures where the formyl group is part of a fused ring or anhydride**, which shouldn't match this rule.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Ensure mutual exclusivity between high yield and low yield patterns within the same rule.** Add code logic that, after matching high yield patterns, excludes those molecules from matching low yield patterns for the same rule. This can prevent cases where a molecule like tryptophan matches both.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Increase specificity in SMARTS patterns by incorporating atom properties.** Use atom valence, hybridization, and ring membership to accurately capture the intended functional groups. For example:
  - **For heterocycles in Rule 4**, specify the heteroatom's position and the size of the ring, like `'[nX2]1cccc1'` for a five-membered aromatic ring containing nitrogen.
  - **For hydroxyl groups in Rule 5**, include chiral centers if stereochemistry is important, or use `[OX2H][CH][OX2H]` to ensure the hydroxyls are on adjacent carbons.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Implement additional code checks to handle overlapping matches.** Modify the code to prioritize rules or implement a hierarchical matching system where certain rules take precedence, and once a molecule matches a rule, it's exempt from matching conflicting rules.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Structural Features for Numeric Representation**

  Transform the qualitative descriptions in the current rules into quantifiable structural features that can be directly calculated from SMILES representations. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield," define numeric features such as:
  - Count of amino groups adjacent to carboxylic acid groups.
  - Number of carboxylic acid groups in the molecule.
  - Presence (1) or absence (0) of specific functional groups.

- **Advice 2**: **Standardize Molecular Descriptors**

  Utilize standardized molecular descriptors and fingerprints, such as MACCS keys, ECFP (Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints), or molecular properties (e.g., LogP, TPSA), which can be computed from SMILES strings. This standardization allows for consistent numeric feature generation across all modifiers.

- **Advice 3**: **Use Substructure Searching for Binary Features**

  Identify key substructures or motifs mentioned in the rules and perform substructure searches to detect their presence in the modifiers. Encode these findings as binary features (1 if present, 0 if absent). For instance:
  - Presence of a pyridine ring directly attached to a carboxylic acid (Rule 9).
  - Existence of multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to a carboxylic acid (Rule 5).

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Physicochemical Properties**

  Augment the rules by including physicochemical properties that can be calculated numerically, such as:
  - Molecular weight.
  - Calculated LogP (lipophilicity).
  - Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA).
  - Number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.
  - These properties can capture effects like hydrophobic interactions and electron density influences mentioned in the rules.

- **Advice 5**: **Assign Numeric Values to Electron-Withdrawing/Drawing Effects**

  Quantify the electron-donating or -withdrawing nature of substituents using parameters like Hammett sigma constants. This approach can replace qualitative statements about groups enhancing or reducing electron density (e.g., Rules 2 and 7).

- **Advice 6**: **Automate Feature Extraction with Cheminformatics Tools**

  Utilize cheminformatics libraries (such as RDKit) to programmatically extract the defined features from SMILES strings. Automation ensures consistency and efficiency in generating the numeric feature matrix and facilitates scaling to larger datasets.

- **Advice 7**: **Simplify and Generalize Complex Rules**

  Break down complex or highly specific rules into simpler, more general elements that are easier to quantify. For example:
  - Instead of specifying "thiol groups not adjacent to carboxylic acid yield high yield" (Rule 11), create a feature for "Distance between thiol group and carboxylic acid" measured in number of bonds.
  - Generalize chain length effects by including "Aliphatic chain length" as a numeric feature.

- **Advice 8**: **Create Composite Features for Synergistic Effects**

  Where rules suggest interactions between features (e.g., presence of amino group and carboxylic acid in proximity), create composite numeric features that capture these synergistic effects. This can be achieved by multiplying or combining individual features.

- **Advice 9**: **Develop a Hierarchical Feature Framework**

  Organize features hierarchically from general to specific. Start with broad structural classes (e.g., aliphatic acid, aromatic acid) and drill down to specific functional groups or substituents. This structure aids in both feature selection and interpretation.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Features with Statistical Analysis**

  Apply statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to assess the importance and predictive power of each feature. Use techniques like feature importance ranking or correlation analysis to refine the feature set, focusing on those that significantly impact the yield.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity through effective chelation.

- **Rule 2**: **Para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield when the substituent is a coordinating group like amino, nitro, or bromomethyl; substituents like methyl or formyl yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers enhance metal-ligand interactions, improving catalyst performance. Non-coordinating groups do not contribute effectively, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yield; modifiers with single or distant hydroxyl groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with metal centers due to increased coordination sites, improving catalyst effectiveness. Distant or fewer hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and lacking additional functional groups yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length may facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst surface without steric hindrance from additional functional groups, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms yield high yield; those without such heteroatoms yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms do not offer this advantage.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages and terminating with a carboxylic acid yield low yield due to decreased coordination ability and increased conformational flexibility.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are less effective in coordinating with metal ions compared to nitrogen or sulfur, and the flexibility introduced by ether linkages can hinder optimal alignment of coordinating groups with metal centers.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups yield low yield due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms (e.g., oxygen in carboxyl groups) to donate electron density to metal ions, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low yield due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of amino groups diminishes their nucleophilicity and ability to coordinate with metal centers, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yield; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions when appropriately positioned, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may interact differently, potentially leading to catalyst poisoning or less effective coordination.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Reactive aldehyde groups may form irreversible adducts with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalytic sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (greater than 6 carbons) bearing amino or hydroxyl groups yield low yield due to decreased coordination efficiency.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Extended chain length separates the functional group from the carboxylic acid, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination and diminishing the modifier's ability to enhance catalyst performance.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocyclic ring without additional linkers.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to the heterocycle enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing catalyst interactions. Additional linkers or aromatic rings can disrupt optimal coordination geometry.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yield due to increased electron density enhancing metal coordination.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are strong electron donors, increasing electron density on the aromatic ring and adjacent functional groups, which can improve metal-ligand interactions critical for catalysis.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups such as sulfides or methylthioethers can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and amino groups yield low yield due to reduced coordination efficiency and increased conformational flexibility.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: The combination of ether linkages and amino groups may introduce too much flexibility, preventing effective simultaneous coordination necessary for enhancing catalyst performance.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and specific, defining modifiers as α-amino dicarboxylic acids for high yield, which allows unambiguous classification. The rule offers adequate physicochemical insight by explaining how multiple coordination sites enhance catalyst stability through chelation. It considers a combination of sub-structures (α-amino and dicarboxylic acid groups), satisfying complexity. With at least two supporting high-yield data points, the rule has acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clearly defined, distinguishing between para-substituted benzoic acids with coordinating versus non-coordinating substituents, enabling clear classification of modifiers. The rule provides physicochemical insight by relating the presence of coordinating groups to enhanced metal-ligand interactions, which improves catalyst performance. It considers combinations of sub-structures (substituted benzoic acid, position specificity, type of substituent), satisfying complexity. The rule is well-supported with multiple data points for both high and low yields, indicating good coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides clear criteria by specifying that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yield, whereas single or distant hydroxyl groups result in low yield, allowing for unambiguous classification. The rule offers physicochemical insight by explaining how multiple adjacent hydroxyls enhance metal chelation through increased coordination sites. It considers the combination of sub-structures (hydroxyl groups' number and position relative to the carboxylic acid), fulfilling complexity. While supported by multiple high-yield examples, the low-yield side has limited examples, slightly weakening coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in specifying that aliphatic carboxylic acids of 6 to 8 carbons without additional functional groups yield high yield, enabling straightforward classification. The physicochemical insight is reasonable, suggesting optimal chain length for favorable catalyst interactions without steric hindrance. However, the rule is relatively simple, focusing on chain length and absence of functional groups, with less complexity regarding sub-structures. The coverage is limited, with only one high-yield example (octanoic acid), which weakens the rule's support.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in identifying amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms as yielding high yield, while those without heteroatoms yield low yield, allowing clear classification. The physicochemical rationale is sound, highlighting the role of heteroatoms in enhancing coordination with metal ions. The rule demonstrates complexity by combining structural features (amino acid framework, aromatic side chain, presence of heteroatoms). However, coverage is limited, with only one example supporting each outcome, which weakens the robustness of the rule.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that modifiers with ether linkages terminating with a carboxylic acid yield low yield, enabling straightforward identification of such modifiers. The physicochemical insight is appropriate, explaining how ether linkages reduce coordination ability and increase flexibility, hindering effective catalyst interaction. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (ether linkages, terminal carboxylic acid), satisfying complexity. With two supporting low-yield examples, the rule has acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, indicating that modifiers with electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups yield low yield, allowing unambiguous identification. The physicochemical rationale is sound, explaining how electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions. The rule focuses on specific substituents, so complexity is acceptable. However, coverage is limited, with only one low-yield example supporting the rule, which weakens its general applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, specifying that modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low yield, which allows for straightforward classification. The physicochemical rationale is appropriate, explaining how acylation reduces the amino group's ability to coordinate with metals. The rule considers structural features (acylation of amino groups), meeting complexity criteria. However, the rule has limited coverage, supported by only one low-yield example, which diminishes its robustness.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly differentiates modifiers with thiol groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yielding high yield from those with thiol groups on aromatic rings yielding low yield, enabling clear classification. The physicochemical insight is plausible, explaining how aliphatic thiols enhance coordination while aromatic thiols may cause deactivation. The rule demonstrates complexity by considering both the presence and position of thiol groups. However, coverage is limited with only one supporting example for each outcome, reducing the rule's generality.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear in specifying that modifiers containing aldehyde groups yield low yield, facilitating straightforward identification. The physicochemical insight is solid, suggesting that aldehydes can deactivate catalysts through side reactions. The rule focuses on the presence of a specific functional group, meeting complexity criteria. With two low-yield examples supporting the rule, coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly states that modifiers with long aliphatic chains (>6 carbons) bearing amino or hydroxyl groups yield low yield, allowing straightforward classification. The physicochemical rationale is plausible, explaining reduced coordination due to functional groups being distant from the carboxylic acid. The rule combines considerations of chain length and functional groups, satisfying complexity. With multiple low-yield examples, coverage is robust.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear in specifying that nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached, and low yield when linkers are present. The physicochemical rationale is sound, explaining how direct attachment facilitates effective coordination. The rule's complexity is acceptable, combining heterocycle presence and carboxyl positioning. Coverage is sufficient with multiple high-yield examples and a supporting low-yield example.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear, stating that modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yield, enabling straightforward classification. The physicochemical insight is appropriate, explaining increased electron density enhancing coordination. The rule focuses on specific substituents on aromatic rings, satisfying complexity. However, coverage is minimal, with only one high-yield example supporting the rule, which limits its robustness.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear in indicating that amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning, allowing unambiguous classification. The physicochemical rationale is credible, discussing strong binding of sulfur groups to metals. The rule shows complexity by focusing on both amino acid structure and sulfur side chains. However, coverage is limited, with only one low-yield example supporting the rule, which weakens its general applicability.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear, stating that modifiers with flexible ether linkages and amino groups yield low yield, enabling clear identification. The physicochemical rationale is acceptable, explaining how increased flexibility reduces coordination efficiency. The rule combines considerations of ether linkages and amino groups, satisfying complexity. However, the rule's coverage is limited, with only one low-yield example, reducing its robustness.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity through effective chelation.

- **Rule 2**: **Para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield when the substituent is a coordinating group like amino, nitro, or bromomethyl; substituents like methyl or formyl yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers enhance metal-ligand interactions, improving catalyst performance. Non-coordinating groups do not contribute effectively, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yield; modifiers with single or distant hydroxyl groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with metal centers due to increased coordination sites, improving catalyst effectiveness. Distant or fewer hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and lacking additional functional groups yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length may facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst surface without steric hindrance from additional functional groups, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms yield high yield; those without such heteroatoms yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms do not offer this advantage.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages and terminating with a carboxylic acid yield low yield due to decreased coordination ability and increased conformational flexibility.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are less effective in coordinating with metal ions compared to nitrogen or sulfur, and the flexibility introduced by ether linkages can hinder optimal alignment of coordinating groups with metal centers.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups yield low yield due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms (e.g., oxygen in carboxyl groups) to donate electron density to metal ions, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low yield due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of amino groups diminishes their nucleophilicity and ability to coordinate with metal centers, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yield; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions when appropriately positioned, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may interact differently, potentially leading to catalyst poisoning or less effective coordination.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Reactive aldehyde groups may form irreversible adducts with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalytic sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (greater than 6 carbons) bearing amino or hydroxyl groups yield low yield due to decreased coordination efficiency.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Extended chain length separates the functional group from the carboxylic acid, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination and diminishing the modifier's ability to enhance catalyst performance.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocyclic ring without additional linkers.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to the heterocycle enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing catalyst interactions. Additional linkers or aromatic rings can disrupt optimal coordination geometry.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yield due to increased electron density enhancing metal coordination.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are strong electron donors, increasing electron density on the aromatic ring and adjacent functional groups, which can improve metal-ligand interactions critical for catalysis.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups such as sulfides or methylthioethers can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and amino groups yield low yield due to reduced coordination efficiency and increased conformational flexibility.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: The combination of ether linkages and amino groups may introduce too much flexibility, preventing effective simultaneous coordination necessary for enhancing catalyst performance.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Refine the Logical Structure of Rule Matching**

  The current code uses an **AND logic** for matching patterns within each rule. This means that all patterns listed under 'patterns' must be present in the molecule for the rule to apply. However, some rules require a combination of **AND and OR logic**. For example, in **Rule 2**, we need to match a benzoic acid core **and** one of the coordinating substituents (amino, nitro, or bromomethyl) at the para position. To fix this:

  - Implement a mechanism to specify whether patterns within a rule should be evaluated using **AND** or **OR** logic.
  - Use nested structures or logical operators in the rule definitions. For instance, define 'required_patterns' (to be matched with AND logic) and 'optional_patterns' or 'alternative_patterns' (to be matched with OR logic).

  **Example Modification for Rule 2**:
  ```python
  {
      'number': 2,
      'description': 'Para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield when the substituent is a coordinating group like amino, nitro, or bromomethyl.',
      'required_patterns': [
          'c1ccc(cc1)[C;X3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]',  # Benzoic acid core
      ],
      'alternative_patterns': [
          '[NX3][c]1ccc(cc1)[C;X3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]',         # Amino group at para position
          '[c]1ccc(cc1[N+](=O)[O-])[C;X3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]',  # Nitro group at para position
          '[Br][CH2][c]1ccc(cc1)[C;X3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'      # Bromomethyl group at para position
      ],
      'exclude_patterns': [
          '[c]1ccc(cc1C)[C;X3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]',   # Methyl substituent
          '[c]1ccc(cc1C=O)[C;X3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'  # Formyl substituent
      ],
      'prediction': 1
  }
  ```
  Then, update the code to handle 'required_patterns' with AND logic and 'alternative_patterns' with OR logic.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct the Pattern Matching in Rule 1**

  **Rule 1** aims to identify α-amino dicarboxylic acids. However, the current SMARTS patterns may incorrectly match any amino acid with at least one carboxylic acid. The issue is that the second carboxylic acid pattern `'[#6][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` can match any carboxylic acid connected to any carbon, which can lead to false positives.

  To improve specificity:

  - Ensure that the second carboxylic acid is correctly positioned within the molecule, such as at the β or γ carbon.
  - Modify the SMARTS pattern to specify the relative positions of the functional groups.

  **Example Modification**:
  ```python
  {
      'number': 1,
      'description': 'Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.',
      'patterns': [
          '[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]',  # α-amino with adjacent second carboxylic acid
      ],
      'prediction': 1
  }
  ```
  This pattern ensures that the second carboxylic acid is directly connected to the α-carbon or at a specific position.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Adjust the Code to Handle Complex Functional Groups**

  Some molecules may have functional groups that are not correctly identified due to simplified SMARTS patterns. For example, **Rule 5** requires identifying amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms. The current pattern may not accurately capture heteroaromatic rings like indole.

  To address this:

  - Use more comprehensive SMARTS patterns that accurately reflect the structures in question.
  - Consider using recursive SMARTS or defining the specific heteroaromatic systems.

  **Example Modification for Rule 5**:
  ```python
  {
      'number': 5,
      'description': 'Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms yield high yield.',
      'patterns': [
          '[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX4][c][n][c][c][c]',  # Amino acid with indole side chain (tryptophan)
      ],
      'prediction': 1
  }
  ```
  Ensure that the code can correctly parse and match such patterns.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Improve Handling of Exclusion Criteria**

  In some rules, like **Rule 2**, exclusion patterns are crucial to differentiate between high and low yield modifiers. The code should ensure that if any of the exclusion patterns match, the molecule is excluded from matching the rule, even if it matches the required patterns.

  - Verify that exclusion patterns are being applied correctly.
  - Test the code with molecules known to match exclusion patterns to see if they are properly excluded.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Standardize the Representation of Functional Groups**

  Ensure consistency in defining functional groups across different rules to prevent misclassification. For instance, carboxylic acid groups are represented in various ways in the SMARTS patterns.

  - Adopt standardized SMARTS patterns for common functional groups and reference them in the rules.
  - This approach reduces errors and makes the code more maintainable.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Enhance the Parsing of Molecules with Complex Substructures**

  Some modifiers may have complex or uncommon substructures that the current code does not handle well.

  - Use more advanced chemical informatics libraries or functions that can better interpret complex SMILES strings.
  - Incorporate error handling and logging to identify and troubleshoot molecules that fail to parse.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Test the Code with a Diverse Set of Examples**

  Validate the accuracy of the SMARTS patterns and rule implementations by testing the code with a variety of molecules that are known to match or not match each rule.

  - Create a test suite with positive and negative examples for each rule.
  - Adjust the SMARTS patterns based on the test results to improve reliability.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Document the Code and Rules Clearly**

  Provide detailed comments and documentation within the code to explain the purpose and structure of each SMARTS pattern.

  - This practice aids in code maintenance and helps collaborators understand and modify the code as needed.
  
- **Suggestion 9**: **Update the Code to Handle Tautomeric Forms and Protonation States**

  Some molecules may exist in different tautomeric forms or protonation states that can affect pattern matching.

  - Use tools or functions that standardize molecules before pattern matching.
  - Consider both ionized and non-ionized forms of relevant functional groups in the SMARTS patterns.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Refactor the Code for Scalability and Flexibility**

  As more rules or more complex rules are added, the code should be able to handle them without significant rewrites.

  - Use object-oriented programming principles to encapsulate rule definitions and matching logic.
  - Allow for easy addition or modification of rules by external configurations or files.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

Upon reviewing the current rule metrics in comparison to the previous reference metrics, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current set of rules, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**, as requested.

**Comparison of Metrics:**

1. **Support:**
   - *Previous Average Train Support:* Approximately **17.56%**
   - *Current Train Support:* **3.43%**
   - **Interpretation:** The current rules have a significantly lower support compared to the previous rules. This means that the proportion of records in the training data where both the rule conditions and predictions are true has decreased.

2. **Confidence:**
   - *Previous Average Train Confidence:* Approximately **58.74%**
   - *Current Train Confidence:* **74%**
   - **Interpretation:** There is a noticeable increase in the confidence of the current rules. This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of the rule predictions being true has increased, showcasing improved predictive accuracy for those instances.

3. **Lift:**
   - *Previous Average Train Lift:* Approximately **1.13**
   - *Current Train Lift:* **1.48**
   - **Interpretation:** The lift of the current rules has increased substantially. A lift greater than 1 suggests that the presence of the rule condition increases the probability of the rule prediction occurring more than would be expected by chance. The higher lift indicates a stronger association between the conditions and the predictions in the current rules.

4. **Leverage:**
   - *Previous Average Train Leverage:* Approximately **0.01238**
   - *Current Train Leverage:* **0.01317**
   - **Interpretation:** The leverage has remained relatively stable with a slight increase. This implies that the rules are capturing a marginally higher proportion of the dataset than would be expected by chance, but the increase is minimal.

**Insights:**

- **Increased Confidence and Lift:** The current rules have improved in terms of *confidence* and *lift*, suggesting that the rules are more precise in predicting the outcome when the conditions are met. This indicates a higher quality of rules concerning their predictive power for specific instances.

- **Decreased Support:** The significant drop in *support* suggests that the current rules apply to a much smaller subset of the data. While the rules are more confident and have a higher lift, they cover fewer cases, which could limit their practical applicability.

**Potential Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency:**

- **Local Minimum Concern:** The increase in confidence and lift at the expense of support may indicate that the model is converging to a local minimum, where it overfits to specific patterns within the training data that are not broadly applicable. This is a common issue when optimization focuses heavily on improving certain metrics without considering overall coverage.

- **Need for Further Iterations:** Given that the current rules have lower support, it suggests that the model may benefit from additional iterations. Further refinement is necessary to balance the trade-off between confidence, lift, and support to ensure the rules are both accurate and applicable to a larger portion of the dataset.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Increase Rule Generalization:**
   - **Objective:** Expand the applicability of the rules without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
   - **Approach:** 
     - **Relax Rule Conditions:** Simplify some overly specific conditions to encompass a broader range of data instances.
     - **Combine Similar Rules:** Identify overlapping rules that can be merged to cover more cases while maintaining high confidence.

2. **Balance Precision and Coverage:**
   - **Objective:** Find an optimal balance between the specificity (confidence) and generality (support) of the rules.
   - **Approach:**
     - **Adjust Thresholds:** Re-evaluate the thresholds used for defining high yield and low yield to see if slight adjustments can increase support.
     - **Incorporate Additional Data Features:** Utilize more attributes from the dataset that may contribute to increasing support without sacrificing confidence.

3. **Avoid Overfitting:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure the rules are not too tailored to the training data, which may hinder their performance on unseen data.
   - **Approach:**
     - **Cross-Validation:** Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the generalizability of the rules.
     - **Regularization:** Introduce regularization methods to penalize overly complex rules that do not generalize well.

4. **Iterative Refinement with Feedback:**
   - **Objective:** Continuously improve the rules based on performance metrics and domain knowledge.
   - **Approach:**
     - **Expert Review:** Have domain experts review the rules to ensure they make chemical and catalytic sense.
     - **Iterative Testing:** After adjustments, test the rules again and compare the new metrics to previous iterations to monitor improvements.

**Specific Suggestions Based on Current Rules:**

- **Rule Simplification:** Examine rules that may be too specific, such as those with numerous structural constraints, and determine if they can be generalized. For example, rules specifying exact chain lengths or precise substituent positions might be broadened.

- **Rule Combination:** Look for opportunities to combine rules that have similar rationales but differ in minor details. This can increase support by covering more instances.

- **Inclusion of Moderate Yield Cases:** Consider integrating modifiers that result in moderate yields to increase support. This may slightly reduce confidence but can improve the overall applicability of the rules.

- **Assess Chemical Plausibility:** Ensure that the rules align with chemical principles. If certain structural features are consistently associated with high or low yields, focus on those features and consider exceptions carefully.

**Conclusion**

The current rules demonstrate improved confidence and lift, indicating better precision in predicting high or low yields when the conditions are met. However, the reduced support highlights a limitation in the rules' applicability to a broader dataset. To address this, it is recommended to iteratively refine the rules by increasing their generality without significantly compromising their predictive power. This may involve adjusting rule conditions, combining similar rules, and ensuring that the rules maintain chemical plausibility. Additional iterations and evaluations are advised to achieve a balance between precision and coverage, ultimately leading to a more robust and practical set of rules for predicting catalytic performance.

**Performance Analysis of Current Rules**

---

**1. Evaluate Effectiveness**

The current classification model achieved a validation accuracy of **74.29%**, which is an improvement over several previous iterations. Here is a comparison with previous accuracies:

- **Previous Accuracies**:
  - Validation Accuracies ranged between **51.43%** and **80%** in past iterations.
- **Current Accuracy**:
  - Validation Accuracy: **74.29%**

This indicates that the current set of rules is more effective than in previous iterations, as there is a notable improvement in predictive performance.

---

**2. Assess Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Overfitting**: The model does not appear to be overfitting significantly, as the validation accuracy is relatively high and comparable across different folds.
- **Underfitting**: There may be some underfitting, as the model does not capture all the patterns in data, evidenced by misclassifications in certain molecules.

The model seems to have a reasonable balance between bias and variance, but there is room for improvement to capture more complex relationships.

---

**3. Analyze Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

To identify problematic rules, we analyze molecules where the model's predictions do not match the experimental values and examine the SHAP values associated with each rule.

**a. Molecules where Predicted Loading is High but Experimental Value is Low**

1. **Molecule**: `C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`
   - **Prediction**: High loading
   - **Experimental**: Low loading
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule 8**: **0.08498** (highest positive contribution)
     - **Rule 10**: **0.04987**
     - **Rule 6**: **0.03711**
     - **Rule 7**: **0.03505**
     - **Rule 11**: **0.02625**
     - **Rule 13**: **-0.01469**

   **Analysis**: Rule 8 has the highest positive SHAP value, suggesting that it is contributing most to the incorrect high prediction.

2. **Molecule**: `C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O`
   - **Prediction**: High loading
   - **Experimental**: Low loading
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule 8**: **0.08498** (highest positive contribution)
     - Other rules have similar contributions as above.

   **Analysis**: Again, Rule 8 is the largest contributor to the incorrect high prediction.

3. **Molecule**: `C1=CC(=CC=C1CCCCC(=O)O)O`
   - **Prediction**: High loading
   - **Experimental**: Low loading
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule 8**: **0.05858**
     - **Rule 7**: **0.03406**
     - **Rule 10**: **0.02462**
     - **Rule 11**: **0.04752**

   **Analysis**: Rule 8 again contributes significantly to the incorrect prediction.

**b. Molecules where Predicted Loading is Low but Experimental Value is High**

1. **Molecule**: `C1=CC2=C(C=C1C(=O)O)C(=O)OC2=O`
   - **Prediction**: Low loading
   - **Experimental**: High loading
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule 6**: **-0.49726** (high negative contribution)
     - **Rule 5**: **-0.01563**
     - **Rule 3**: **-0.01508**

   **Analysis**: Rule 6 has a large negative SHAP value, indicating it may be causing the underestimation.

2. **Molecule**: `COC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C(=O)CCC(=O)O)OC`
   - **Prediction**: Low loading
   - **Experimental**: High loading
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule 6**: **-0.49726** (high negative contribution)
     - Similar contributions from other rules as above.

   **Analysis**: Rule 6 is the primary contributor to the incorrect low prediction.

3. **Molecule**: `C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F`
   - **Prediction**: Low loading
   - **Experimental**: Low loading (Correct)
   - **Note**: This helps confirm that Rule 6 may correctly predict low loading in some cases.

**c. Summary of Problematic Rules**

- **Rule 8**: Contributing to overestimations (high SHAP values when prediction is high but should be low).
- **Rule 6**: Contributing to underestimations (high negative SHAP values when prediction is low but should be high).

---

**4. Interpret Accuracy Improvements**

The increase in validation accuracy to **74.29%** from previous lower accuracies suggests that the rules have improved in capturing the underlying patterns. However, the presence of misclassifications indicates that certain rules may not generalize well across all molecules.

---

**5. Derive Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule 8**: This rule seems to over-predict high loading in molecules where the experimental value is low. The rule might be too broadly defined or not accounting for exceptions.

- **Rule 6**: This rule appears to under-predict loading in molecules where the experimental value is high, possibly due to being too restrictive.

**Detailed Observations**:

- **Rule 8**: Focuses on modifiers with acylated amino groups resulting in low yield. However, some molecules with acylated amino groups are yielding high experimental values, suggesting exceptions exist.

- **Rule 6**: States that modifiers containing ether linkages yield low yield. Yet, molecules with ether linkages are sometimes yielding high experimental values, indicating that ether linkages alone may not be sufficient to predict low yield.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

---

**1. Refine Rule 8**

- **Issue**: Rule 8 is over-predicting high loading for modifiers that actually yield low experimental values.
- **Suggestion**:
  - **Specificity**: Add additional structural constraints to Rule 8 to increase its specificity.
  - **Consider Exceptions**: Analyze molecules that are incorrectly predicted and identify structural features that may override the influence of acylated amino groups.
  - **Possible Addition**: Incorporate the electronic effects of nearby functional groups that may enhance coordination despite the acylation.

**2. Adjust Rule 6**

- **Issue**: Rule 6 is under-predicting loading where the experimental value is high.
- **Suggestion**:
  - **Relax Restriction**: Modify Rule 6 to account for cases where ether linkages do not impede coordination, perhaps when other strong coordinating groups are present.
  - **Include Context**: Specify that only certain ether linkages reduce coordination ability, perhaps those that increase flexibility beyond a certain threshold.

**3. Improve Generalization**

- **Issue**: Some rules may be too general or too specific, causing overfitting or underfitting.
- **Suggestion**:
  - **Balance Specificity and Generality**: Ensure rules are neither too broad (leading to over-predictions) nor too narrow (missing true positives).
  - **Iterative Testing**: Continuously test modified rules against validation sets to assess their impact on predictions.

**4. Incorporate Additional Structural Features**

- **Suggestion**:
  - **Metal Coordination Geometry**: Consider the preferred coordination numbers and geometries of the metal centers in catalysts when formulating rules.
  - **Steric Factors**: Include considerations for steric hindrance that may affect modifier coordination.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Account for the overall electronic environment of the modifier, such as conjugation and electron-donating/withdrawing effects beyond individual functional groups.

**5. Utilize SHAP Insights for Rule Refinement**

- **Suggestion**:
  - **Threshold Values**: Use the magnitude of SHAP values to identify thresholds where rules may switch from being beneficial to detrimental.
  - **Rule Interactions**: Investigate how multiple rules interact in the model and modify them to reduce conflicting predictions.

**6. Address Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Overfitting Mitigation**:
  - **Prune Overly Complex Rules**: Simplify rules that are too complex and may not generalize well.
  - **Cross-Validation**: Ensure that model performance is consistent across different folds to prevent overfitting to a specific dataset.
- **Underfitting Mitigation**:
  - **Enhance Rule Coverage**: Incorporate additional rules to capture patterns not currently explained.
  - **Data Augmentation**: Consider expanding the dataset if possible to include more examples of underrepresented molecular features.

---

**Conclusion**

By refining Rule 8 and Rule 6 based on the insights from the SHAP analysis, we can improve the predictive accuracy of the model. Adjusting these rules to account for the identified discrepancies will enhance the model's ability to generalize across different molecules. Additionally, considering more nuanced structural features and ensuring that the rules strike a balance between specificity and generality will further optimize model performance.

---

**Next Steps**

1. **Revise Rule 8**: Introduce additional criteria to make it more specific and account for exceptions.
2. **Modify Rule 6**: Adjust the rule to consider the context in which ether linkages affect coordination.
3. **Re-evaluate Model**: Implement the refined rules and assess their impact on validation accuracy.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Use iterative cycles of SHAP analysis and rule refinement to progressively enhance the model.

---

By systematically addressing the issues highlighted in the SHAP analysis and refining the rules accordingly, we can develop a more accurate and robust model for predicting modifier performance in catalytic systems.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing the Current Rules**

---

1. **Analysis of Current Rule Performance**

   - **Increased Confidence and Lift**: The current rules show an improvement in **confidence** (from approximately 58.74% to 74%) and **lift** (from approximately 1.13 to 1.48). This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, the prediction of high yield is more reliable than before.
   - **Decreased Support**: However, the **support** has decreased significantly (from approximately 17.56% to 3.43%), meaning the rules now apply to a much smaller portion of the dataset.
   - **Risk of Overfitting**: The increased confidence and lift at the expense of support may suggest that the model is overfitting to specific patterns within the training data, reducing its general applicability.

2. **SHAP Analysis and Identification of Problematic Rules**

   - **Rule 6 (Modifiers with Ether Linkages Yield Low Yield)**:
     - *Issue*: Rule 6 is contributing to underestimation of yield in molecules where the experimental value is high.
     - *Evidence*: High negative SHAP values for Rule 6 in molecules incorrectly predicted as low yield but experimentally are high yield.
     - *Implication*: Rule 6 may be too restrictive or not accounting for contexts where ether linkages do not hinder coordination.
   - **Rule 8 (Modifiers with Acylated Amino Groups Yield Low Yield)**:
     - *Issue*: Rule 8 is contributing to overestimation of yield in molecules where the experimental value is low.
     - *Evidence*: High positive SHAP values for Rule 8 in molecules incorrectly predicted as high yield but experimentally are low yield.
     - *Implication*: Rule 8 may be too broadly defined or not considering exceptions where acylated amino groups do not significantly impact yield.

3. **Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**

   - **Refine Logical Structure of Rule Matching (Suggestion 1)**:
     - **Problem**: Current rules use an AND logic for pattern matching, which may not capture the necessary complexity.
     - **Solution**: Implement both **AND** and **OR** logic within rules. Define 'required_patterns' (AND logic) and 'alternative_patterns' (OR logic) to accurately represent conditions.
     - **Example**: For **Rule 2**, specify the benzoic acid core as a required pattern and the coordinating substituents (amino, nitro, bromomethyl) as alternative patterns.
   - **Correct Pattern Matching in Rule 1 (Suggestion 2)**:
     - **Problem**: Rule 1 may incorrectly match any amino acid with at least one carboxylic acid, leading to false positives.
     - **Solution**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to ensure that the second carboxylic acid is correctly positioned relative to the amino group, accurately identifying α-amino dicarboxylic acids.
     - **Implementation**: Adjust the pattern to specify the arrangement of functional groups, ensuring only target molecules are matched.
   - **Handle Complex Functional Groups (Suggestion 3)**:
     - **Problem**: Simplified SMARTS patterns may fail to identify molecules with complex functional groups, such as heteroaromatics in Rule 5.
     - **Solution**: Use more comprehensive SMARTS patterns or recursive SMARTS to accurately capture complex functional groups like indoles or other heteroaromatic systems.
   - **Improve Handling of Exclusion Criteria (Suggestion 4)**:
     - **Problem**: Exclusion patterns may not be correctly applied, leading to misclassifications.
     - **Solution**: Ensure that the code applies exclusion patterns effectively, and if any exclusion pattern matches, the molecule is excluded from the rule's applicability.
   - **Standardize Representation of Functional Groups (Suggestion 5)**:
     - **Problem**: Inconsistent representations of functional groups across rules can cause misclassifications.
     - **Solution**: Adopt standardized SMARTS patterns for common functional groups to maintain consistency and reduce errors.
   - **Adjust Rule 6 for Context (Specific Recommendation)**:
     - **Issue**: Rule 6 is too broad, leading to underestimation of yield in certain molecules.
     - **Action**: Modify Rule 6 to specify that only certain types of ether linkages (e.g., those introducing excessive conformational flexibility) lead to low yield, or consider additional structural features that could mitigate the negative impact.
   - **Refine Rule 8 for Specificity (Specific Recommendation)**:
     - **Issue**: Rule 8 over-predicts high yield in molecules where acylated amino groups do not result in high experimental yield.
     - **Action**: Introduce additional structural constraints or context considerations in Rule 8 to account for exceptions, ensuring it does not overgeneralize.
   - **Balance Precision and Coverage (General Recommendation)**:
     - **Objective**: Increase the applicability of the rules (support) without significantly compromising accuracy (confidence).
     - **Approach**:
       - Generalize overly specific rules to cover more cases.
       - Combine similar rules where applicable.
       - Adjust thresholds or conditions within the rules to encompass a broader range of molecules.

4. **Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

   - **Yes, Further Optimization is Possible**:
     - **Reasoning**:
       - The current rules have reduced support, indicating limited applicability.
       - SHAP analysis identifies specific rules that contribute to misclassifications.
       - Adjusting and refining these rules can improve both support and confidence.
     - **Potential Benefits**:
       - Improved balance between precision and coverage.
       - Enhanced generalizability and applicability to new data.
       - Reduction in overfitting by preventing rules from being too narrowly defined.

**Conclusion**

In summary, while the current rules have improved in confidence and lift, there is room for further optimization to increase support and ensure the rules are both accurate and broadly applicable. By refining specific problematic rules and adjusting the logical structure of rule matching, we can enhance the model's performance without overfitting.

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity through effective chelation.

- **Rule 2**: **Para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield when the substituent is a coordinating group like amino, nitro, or bromomethyl; substituents like methyl or formyl yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers enhance metal-ligand interactions, improving catalyst performance. Non-coordinating groups do not contribute effectively, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yield; modifiers with single or distant hydroxyl groups yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with metal centers due to increased coordination sites, improving catalyst effectiveness. Distant or fewer hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and lacking additional functional groups yield high yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length may facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst surface without steric hindrance from additional functional groups, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms yield high yield; those without such heteroatoms yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms do not offer this advantage.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages and terminating with a carboxylic acid yield low yield due to decreased coordination ability and increased conformational flexibility.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms are less effective in coordinating with metal ions compared to nitrogen or sulfur, and the flexibility introduced by ether linkages can hinder optimal alignment of coordinating groups with metal centers.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups yield low yield due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms (e.g., oxygen in carboxyl groups) to donate electron density to metal ions, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low yield due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of amino groups diminishes their nucleophilicity and ability to coordinate with metal centers, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yield; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring yield low yield.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions when appropriately positioned, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may interact differently, potentially leading to catalyst poisoning or less effective coordination.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Reactive aldehyde groups may form irreversible adducts with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalytic sites.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (greater than 6 carbons) bearing amino or hydroxyl groups yield low yield due to decreased coordination efficiency.**
  - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Extended chain length separates the functional group from the carboxylic acid, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination and diminishing the modifier's ability to enhance catalyst performance.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocyclic ring without additional linkers.**
  - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to the heterocycle enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing catalyst interactions. Additional linkers or aromatic rings can disrupt optimal coordination geometry.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yield due to increased electron density enhancing metal coordination.**
  - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are strong electron donors, increasing electron density on the aromatic ring and adjacent functional groups, which can improve metal-ligand interactions critical for catalysis.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups such as sulfides or methylthioethers can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and amino groups yield low yield due to reduced coordination efficiency and increased conformational flexibility.**
  - *Low Yield Example*: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *Rationale*: The combination of ether linkages and amino groups may introduce too much flexibility, preventing effective simultaneous coordination necessary for enhancing catalyst performance.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine the Logical Structure of Rule Matching**

  - **Implementation**: Modify the rule matching logic to incorporate both **'required_patterns'** and **'alternative_patterns'**. This allows for more precise control over how molecular features are matched.
    - **Required Patterns (AND logic)**: Define core structural features that must be present in the molecule.
    - **Alternative Patterns (OR logic)**: Specify a set of functional groups or substituents where any one match is sufficient.
  - **Example**: For **Rule 2** (Para-substituted benzoic acids with coordinating groups yield high yield):
    - **Required Pattern**: The molecule must contain a **benzoic acid core**.
    - **Alternative Patterns**: The para position must have one of the following coordinating groups: **amino**, **nitro**, or **bromomethyl**.

- **Advice 2**: **Correct Pattern Matching in Rule 1 for α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids**

  - **Implementation**: Update the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 to accurately represent α-amino dicarboxylic acids.
    - Ensure the amino group is on the α-carbon adjacent to one carboxylic acid.
    - Specify that there is a second carboxylic acid group on the same molecule.
  - **SMARTS Pattern Example**: `N[C@@H](C(=O)O)C(=O)O` (This pattern represents an α-amino acid with two carboxylic acid groups).

- **Advice 3**: **Adjust Rule 6 to Specify Problematic Ether Linkages**

  - **Implementation**: Refine Rule 6 to target only ethers that negatively impact yield due to increased flexibility.
    - **Specify**: Long, flexible polyether chains terminating with a carboxylic acid.
    - **Exclude**: Ethers in rigid rings or those that do not significantly increase flexibility.
  - **SMARTS Pattern Example**: `OCCOCCOCC(=O)O` (Pattern representing long flexible ether chains).
  - **Action**: Update the rule to focus on modifiers where the ether linkage leads to decreased coordination efficiency.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rule 8 for Specificity Regarding Acylated Amino Groups**

  - **Implementation**: Modify Rule 8 to include additional structural constraints.
    - **Specify**: Acylated primary amino groups where the acyl group significantly reduces coordination ability.
    - **Consider**: The nature of the acyl group (e.g., bulky or electron-withdrawing groups).
  - **SMARTS Pattern Example**: `NC(=O)C` (Represents an acylated amino group).
  - **Action**: Adjust the rule to avoid overgeneralization and account for cases where acylation does not hinder coordination.

- **Advice 5**: **Standardize Representation of Functional Groups Across Rules**

  - **Implementation**: Develop a library of standardized SMARTS patterns for common functional groups.
    - **Examples**:
      - **Amino Group**: `N`
      - **Carboxylic Acid**: `C(=O)O`
      - **Hydroxyl Group**: `O`
    - Use these patterns consistently in all rules to ensure accurate matching.
  - **Benefit**: Prevents inconsistent matches and ensures that all relevant molecules are correctly identified.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Complex Functional Groups Using Advanced SMARTS**

  - **Implementation**: Utilize recursive SMARTS patterns to accurately capture complex heteroaromatic systems.
    - **Example for Indole (Rule 5)**:
      - **SMARTS Pattern**: `c1cc2c([nH]1)cccc2` (Represents an indole ring).
    - **Include**: Position of coordinating heteroatoms within the heterocycle.
  - **Action**: Update Rule 5 to use these patterns, ensuring modifiers with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms are accurately matched.

- **Advice 7**: **Improve Handling of Exclusion Criteria in Rules**

  - **Implementation**: Ensure that exclusion patterns are properly defined and applied in the code.
    - When an exclusion pattern matches, the molecule should be excluded from the rule's applicability.
    - **Test**: Confirm that molecules matching the exclusion are not incorrectly classified.
  - **Action**: Review and adjust the code logic to handle exclusions effectively, avoiding misclassifications.

- **Advice 8**: **Balance Precision and Coverage to Enhance Rule Applicability**

  - **Implementation**:
    - **Generalize Overly Specific Rules**: Broaden rules where possible without significantly compromising accuracy.
    - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge rules that cover related structural features to increase support.
    - **Adjust Thresholds**: Modify conditions (e.g., chain length ranges, number of functional groups) to encompass a wider range of molecules.
  - **Example**:
    - **Rule 4** (Aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons yield high yield):
      - Expand the chain length range if data supports similar yields for chain lengths slightly outside this range.
  - **Benefit**: Increases the support of the rules, making them applicable to a larger dataset while maintaining acceptable confidence.

**End of Advice**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yield.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*).
   - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity through effective chelation.

2. **Rule 2**: **Para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yield when the substituent is a coordinating group like amino, nitro, or bromomethyl; substituents like methyl, formyl, or sulfanyl yield low yield.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers enhance metal-ligand interactions, improving catalyst performance. Non-coordinating or potentially catalyst-poisoning groups reduce effectiveness, leading to lower yields.

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid yield high yield; modifiers with single or distant hydroxyl groups yield low yield.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with metal centers due to increased coordination sites, improving catalyst effectiveness. Distant or fewer hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination.

4. **Rule 4**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and lacking additional functional groups yield high yield; similar acids with amino or hydroxyl groups yield low yield.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted long-chain acids facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst surface without steric hindrance from additional functional groups, enhancing catalytic activity. Substituents like amino or hydroxyl groups may reduce coordination efficiency due to increased flexibility or improper alignment.

5. **Rule 5**: **Amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms yield high yield; those without such heteroatoms yield low yield.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
   - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
   - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms do not offer this advantage.

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages yield low yield due to decreased coordination efficiency and increased conformational flexibility.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: The flexibility introduced by ether linkages can hinder optimal alignment of coordinating groups with metal centers, reducing the effectiveness of catalyst modification.

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains yield low yield due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

   - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms (e.g., oxygen in carboxyl groups) to donate electron density to metal ions, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups yield low yield due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**

   - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Acylation of amino groups diminishes their nucleophilicity and ability to coordinate with metal centers, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yield; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring yield low yield.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions when appropriately positioned, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may interact differently, potentially leading to catalyst poisoning or less effective coordination.

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Reactive aldehyde groups may form irreversible adducts with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalytic sites.

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yield when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocyclic ring without additional linkers; those with additional aromatic rings yield low yield.**

    - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to the heterocycle enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing catalyst interactions. Additional linkers or aromatic rings can disrupt optimal coordination geometry.

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yield due to increased electron density enhancing metal coordination.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are strong electron donors, increasing electron density on the aromatic ring and adjacent functional groups, which can improve metal-ligand interactions critical for catalysis.

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups such as sulfides or methylthioethers can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

14. **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with oxo (carbonyl) groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yield low yield when the compound is flexible; rigid or aromatic structures yield high yield.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Rigid structures facilitate effective coordination due to fixed geometry, while flexibility can impede proper alignment of coordinating groups with the metal center.

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and terminal amino groups yield low yield due to reduced coordination efficiency and increased conformational flexibility.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: The combination of ether linkages and amino groups introduces too much flexibility, preventing effective simultaneous coordination necessary for enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** is clear and provides property insight into potential catalyst poisoning by sulfur-containing side chains. However, it lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one data point.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** is clear, detailing how rigidity affects the impact of adjacent oxo groups. The property insight is sound, and the rule considers structural combinations, satisfying complexity. Despite this, it is supported by only one high yield and one low yield data point, which is insufficient for solid coverage.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is clear and offers property insight into how flexibility and amino groups affect coordination. However, it is supported by only one data point, failing to meet the coverage criterion.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Improve Rule Coverage by Merging Similar Rules**

  Several rules (e.g., Rules 4 and 15, Rules 6 and 12) address similar structural features but are treated separately, leading to limited coverage. To enhance rule robustness and coverage:

  - **Merge Rules 4 and 15**: Combine the criteria of aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons lacking additional functional groups (Rule 4) and modifiers with flexible ether linkages and terminal amino groups yielding low yield (Rule 15). This merger can create a more comprehensive rule that accounts for chain length and the presence or absence of functional groups affecting yield.

  - **Merge Rules 6 and 12**: Both rules focus on modifiers containing ether linkages and their impact on coordination efficiency. Consolidate them into a single rule that addresses modifiers with ether linkages causing decreased coordination due to increased flexibility, and specify the impact of terminating functional groups.

- **Advice 2**: **Enhance Rules with Limited Data Points by Incorporating Additional Examples**

  Some rules (e.g., Rules 7, 8, 9, 13) have limited supporting data, weakening their validity. To strengthen these rules:

  - **Expand Data Set**: Include more modifiers that fit these criteria to provide additional supporting or contradicting data points.

  - **Adjust Rule Criteria**: If additional data is not available, consider broadening the rule criteria to encompass more existing data points or merge with similar rules to improve coverage.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rules with Insufficient Specificity**

  Rules that are too broad or too narrow may not effectively predict yields. For instance:

  - **Rule 4 (Aliphatic Chain Lengths)**: Since only one high-yield example supports this rule, consider specifying additional structural features that contribute to high yield, such as the absence of branching or specific interactions with the catalyst surface.

  - **Rule 13 (Methoxy Groups on Aromatic Rings)**: With limited examples, broaden the rule to include other electron-donating substituents that may enhance yield, thereby increasing coverage and applicability.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR)**

  Utilize QSAR analysis to identify molecular descriptors that correlate with high or low yields. This approach can help refine existing rules or generate new ones based on statistically significant correlations, enhancing the predictive power of the rules.

- **Advice 5**: **Prioritize Rules Based on Data Support and Chemical Rationale**

  Focus on rules that have strong data support and clear chemical rationales:

  - **Emphasize Rules 1, 2, 3, 5, and 11**: These rules have better coverage and strong physicochemical insights. Prioritizing these can improve the overall reliability of the rule set.

  - **Reevaluate or Remove Weak Rules**: For rules with minimal support (e.g., Rules 7, 8, 13), consider reevaluating their necessity. If they cannot be strengthened with additional data or broader criteria, they may be excluded to enhance the rule set's overall quality.

- **Advice 6**: **Clarify and Standardize Functional Group Definitions**

  Ensure that the definitions of functional groups and structural features are consistent across all rules:

  - **Use Standard Chemical Nomenclature**: Apply IUPAC naming conventions and standard definitions for functional groups to avoid ambiguity.

  - **Provide Structural Illustrations**: Where possible, include structural diagrams or SMILES representations to aid in the clear identification of the structural features described in the rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Validate Rules Against External Data**

  To enhance the robustness of the rules:

  - **Test Rules with External Modifiers**: Apply the current rules to additional modifiers not included in the initial dataset to assess their predictive accuracy.

  - **Iteratively Refine Rules**: Use the outcomes from external validation to further refine the rules, improving both their coverage and specificity.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Negative Examples in High Yield Rules**

  Strengthen high-yield rules by including negative examples (low-yield modifiers that almost fit the rule but do not) to highlight the importance of specific structural features:

  - **Refine Rule Boundaries**: This helps in precisely defining the boundaries of each rule, enhancing their specificity and predictive capability.

- **Advice 9**: **Address Potential Overlaps and Conflicts Between Rules**

  Identify and resolve any overlaps or contradictions between rules to prevent ambiguity in classification:

  - **Establish Rule Hierarchy**: Define a priority order for applying rules when overlaps occur, possibly based on the strength of data support or chemical rationale.

  - **Clarify Rule Applicability**: Specify any exceptions or special cases within the rules to minimize conflicts.

- **Advice 10**: **Consult Project Manager's Priorities and Insights**

  Since advice from the Project Manager is important:

  - **Align Rule Optimization with Project Goals**: Ensure that the improved rules meet the project's objectives, focusing on factors deemed critical by the Project Manager.

  - **Incorporate Feedback**: If specific guidance or priorities were provided by the Project Manager, integrate those into the rule refinement process.

Polar substituents may interfere with these interactions or lead to undesired coordination, resulting in lower yields.

5. **Amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms yield high yields; those without such heteroatoms yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
   - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
   - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms do not offer this advantage.

6. **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages yield low yields due to decreased coordination efficiency and increased conformational flexibility.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: The flexibility introduced by ether linkages can hinder optimal alignment of coordinating groups with metal centers, reducing the effectiveness of catalyst modification.

7. **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains yield low yields due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

   - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms (e.g., oxygen in carboxyl groups) to donate electron density to metal ions, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

8. **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yields; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions when appropriately positioned, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may interact differently, potentially leading to catalyst poisoning or less effective coordination.

9. **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yields due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Reactive aldehyde groups may form irreversible adducts with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalytic sites.

10. **Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yields when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocycle; those with additional aromatic rings or linkers yield low yields.**

    - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to the heterocycle enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing catalyst interactions. Additional linkers or aromatic rings can disrupt optimal coordination geometry.

11. **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yields due to increased electron density enhancing metal coordination.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are strong electron donors, increasing electron density on the aromatic ring and adjacent functional groups, which can improve metal-ligand interactions critical for catalysis.

12. **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated yield low yields due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Acylation of amino groups diminishes their nucleophilicity and ability to coordinate with metal centers, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

13. **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yields due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups such as sulfides or methylthioethers can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

14. **Modifiers with oxo (carbonyl) groups within a rigid aromatic framework yield high yields; similar modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains yield low yields.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Rigid structures facilitate effective coordination due to fixed geometry, while flexibility can impede proper alignment of coordinating groups with the metal center.

15. **Modifiers combining flexible ether linkages and terminal amino groups yield low yields due to excessive flexibility hindering effective coordination.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: The combination of ether linkages and amino groups introduces too much flexibility, preventing effective simultaneous coordination necessary for enhancing catalyst performance.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*).
   - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity through effective chelation.

2. **Para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yields when the para-substituent is a coordinating or electron-withdrawing group like amino, nitro, or bromomethyl; substituents like methyl, formyl, or sulfanyl yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Coordinating or electron-withdrawing substituents enhance metal-ligand interactions by increasing electron deficiency, improving catalyst performance. Electron-donating or catalyst-poisoning groups reduce effectiveness, leading to lower yields.

3. **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxylic acid yield high yields; modifiers with single or distant hydroxyl groups yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
   - *Low Yield Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with metal centers due to increased coordination sites, improving catalyst effectiveness. Distant or fewer hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination.

4. **Unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons yield high yields; similar acids with additional polar functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, sulfanyl) yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted long-chain acids facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst surface without steric hindrance from additional functional groups, enhancing catalytic activity. Polar substituents may interfere with these interactions or lead to undesired coordination, resulting in lower yields.

5. **Amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms yield high yields; those without such heteroatoms yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
   - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
   - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms do not offer this advantage.

6. **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages yield low yields due to decreased coordination efficiency and increased conformational flexibility.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: The flexibility introduced by ether linkages can hinder optimal alignment of coordinating groups with metal centers, reducing the effectiveness of catalyst modification.

7. **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains yield low yields due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

   - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms (e.g., oxygen in carboxyl groups) to donate electron density to metal ions, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

8. **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yields; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions when appropriately positioned, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may interact differently, potentially leading to catalyst poisoning or less effective coordination.

9. **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yields due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Reactive aldehyde groups may form irreversible adducts with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalytic sites.

10. **Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yields when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocycle; those with additional aromatic rings or linkers yield low yields.**

    - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to the heterocycle enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing catalyst interactions. Additional linkers or aromatic rings can disrupt optimal coordination geometry.

11. **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yields due to increased electron density enhancing metal coordination.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are strong electron donors, increasing electron density on the aromatic ring and adjacent functional groups, which can improve metal-ligand interactions critical for catalysis.

12. **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated yield low yields due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Acylation of amino groups diminishes their nucleophilicity and ability to coordinate with metal centers, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

13. **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yields due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups such as sulfides or methylthioethers can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

14. **Modifiers with oxo (carbonyl) groups within a rigid aromatic framework yield high yields; similar modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains yield low yields.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Rigid structures facilitate effective coordination due to fixed geometry, while flexibility can impede proper alignment of coordinating groups with the metal center.

15. **Modifiers combining flexible ether linkages and terminal amino groups yield low yields due to excessive flexibility hindering effective coordination.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: The combination of ether linkages and amino groups introduces too much flexibility, preventing effective simultaneous coordination necessary for enhancing catalyst performance.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully formulated by analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the reaction yield. Each rule illustrates combinations of functional groups and structural features in the modifiers that correlate with high or low yields. By applying these rules, one can predict the expected yield outcome for any new molecular modifier fitting the described criteria, aiding in the optimization and control of the reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: For **Rule 1**, remove explicit hydrogen counts from the SMARTS pattern to allow matching of molecules with implicit hydrogens. Change the pattern from `'[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H1])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` to `'[NX3][CX4]([CX3](=O)[OX1H1])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`. This will enable matching with α-amino dicarboxylic acids like aspartic acid and glutamic acid in the SMILES list.

- **Suggestion 2**: In **Rule 1**, adjust the oxygen patterns in the carboxylic acid groups to account for possible deprotonated forms. Modify `'[OX1H1]'` to `'[OX1H1,OX1-]'` to include both protonated and deprotonated carboxyl groups. The revised pattern becomes `'[NX3][CX4]([CX3](=O)[O;H1,-])[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]'`.

- **Suggestion 3**: For **Rule 1**, consider the zwitterionic forms of amino acids. Modify the nitrogen pattern from `'[NX3]'` to `'[NX3,NX4+]'` to include protonated amine groups. The updated pattern is `'[NX3,NX4+][CX4]([CX3](=O)[O;H1,-])[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]'`.

- **Suggestion 4**: For **Rule 2**, ensure that the SMARTS pattern accurately captures **para-substituted benzoic acids** with coordinating or electron-withdrawing groups. The current pattern may not correctly identify the para position. Update the pattern to use recursive SMARTS or explicit positional specifications. For example, use `'c1ccc(cc1C(=O)O)[NX3H2,N+](=O)[O-],CBr'` to match amino, nitro, or bromomethyl substituents at the para position.

- **Suggestion 5**: In **Rule 2.1**, similarly adjust the SMARTS pattern to correctly identify para-substituted benzoic acids with specified substituents like methyl, formyl, or sulfanyl. Ensure that the para position is explicitly defined. 

- **Suggestion 6**: For **Rule 3**, modify the SMARTS pattern to detect multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid more generally. Change the pattern to include any number of adjacent hydroxyl-bearing carbons connected to the carboxylic acid. For example, use `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])'` to match gluconic acid-like structures.

- **Suggestion 7**: In **Rule 3.1**, ensure that the exclude patterns correctly prevent matching molecules with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups. Also, adjust the patterns to avoid matching molecules with only distant hydroxyl groups.

- **Suggestion 8**: For **Rule 4**, generalize the patterns to match **unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids** with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons without specifying exact chain lengths. Use a SMARTS pattern like `'[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` to match chain lengths between 6 and 8 carbons.

- **Suggestion 9**: In **Rule 4**, include an exclusion pattern for molecules with additional polar functional groups. Add an exclude pattern like `'[*][NX3,NX4+,*X2H]'` to exclude amino, hydroxyl, and sulfanyl groups anywhere in the molecule.

- **Suggestion 10**: For **Rule 5**, adjust the SMARTS pattern to match amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms more accurately. Use a pattern like `'[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H1])[CX4H2][c][n,o,s]'` to match side chains with heteroatoms.

- **Suggestion 11**: In **Rule 5.1**, modify the pattern to match amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms. Use `'[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H1])[CX4H2][c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1'` and ensure that heteroatoms are excluded in the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 12**: For **Rule 6**, update the SMARTS pattern to match any flexible ether linkages, not just specific chain lengths. Use a pattern like `'[#6][OX2][#6]'` repeated any number of times to detect flexible ether chains.

- **Suggestion 13**: In **Rule 7**, broaden the SMARTS pattern to detect perfluoroalkyl chains more effectively. Use a pattern like `'[CX4]([CF3])([CF3])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` or `'[CX4]([F])([F])([F])'` to match trifluoromethyl groups.

- **Suggestion 14**: For **Rule 8**, adjust the pattern for aliphatic thiol groups adjacent to carboxylic acids. Use `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][CX4][SX2H]'` to ensure the thiol is adjacent to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 15**: In **Rule 8.1**, ensure that the pattern correctly identifies thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings. Use a pattern like `'[c][SX2H]'` without adjacent aliphatic carbons.

- **Suggestion 16**: For **Rule 10**, refine the patterns to accurately match nitrogen-containing heterocycles with carboxyl groups directly attached. Use patterns like `'n1cccc1C(=O)O'` for pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, and ensure that additional rings or linkers are excluded.

- **Suggestion 17**: In **Rule 10**, include an exclude pattern for molecules with additional aromatic rings or linkers attached to the heterocycle. Use an exclude pattern like `'n1cccc1-c2ccccc2C(=O)O'`.

- **Suggestion 18**: For **Rule 11**, improve the pattern to detect methoxy groups on aromatic rings more generally. Use a pattern like `'c[OX2][CH3]'` to match any methoxy-substituted aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 19**: For **Rule 12**, adjust the SMARTS pattern to match acylated amino groups accurately. Use `'[NX3][CX3](=O)'` to find amide linkages where the amino group is acylated.

- **Suggestion 20**: For all rules, remove or generalize explicit valence and charge states in SMARTS patterns where appropriate. This helps in matching molecules that may have different protonation states or charge distributions not specified in the SMILES.

- **Suggestion 21**: Test each SMARTS pattern individually against known molecules that should match and should not match. Use tools like RDKit's `MolFromSmiles` and `HasSubstructMatch` in interactive sessions to verify patterns.

- **Suggestion 22**: Ensure that the code checks for multiple matches in molecules where a rule might be matched more than once, and account for such cases in the feature matrix if relevant.

- **Suggestion 23**: Consider adding aromaticity considerations explicitly in SMARTS patterns where applicable, using `'c'` for aromatic carbons and `'n'` for aromatic nitrogens, to correctly identify aromatic systems.

- **Suggestion 24**: For rules involving specific positions (ortho, meta, para), use RDKit's atom mapping or more sophisticated SMARTS features to specify these positions accurately.

- **Suggestion 25**: Ensure that the code handles tautomers, stereochemistry, and resonance structures if they are relevant to the rule matching.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*).
   - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity through effective chelation.

2. **Para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yields when the para-substituent is a coordinating or electron-withdrawing group like amino, nitro, or bromomethyl; substituents like methyl, formyl, or sulfanyl yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Coordinating or electron-withdrawing substituents enhance metal-ligand interactions by increasing electron deficiency, improving catalyst performance. Electron-donating or catalyst-poisoning groups reduce effectiveness, leading to lower yields.

3. **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxylic acid yield high yields; modifiers with single or distant hydroxyl groups yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
   - *Low Yield Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with metal centers due to increased coordination sites, improving catalyst effectiveness. Distant or fewer hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination.

4. **Unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons yield high yields; similar acids with additional polar functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, sulfanyl) yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted long-chain acids facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst surface without steric hindrance from additional functional groups, enhancing catalytic activity. Polar substituents may interfere with these interactions or lead to undesired coordination, resulting in lower yields.

5. **Amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms yield high yields; those without such heteroatoms yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
   - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
   - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms do not offer this advantage.

6. **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages yield low yields due to decreased coordination efficiency and increased conformational flexibility.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: The flexibility introduced by ether linkages can hinder optimal alignment of coordinating groups with metal centers, reducing the effectiveness of catalyst modification.

7. **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains yield low yields due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

   - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms (e.g., oxygen in carboxyl groups) to donate electron density to metal ions, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

8. **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yields; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions when appropriately positioned, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may interact differently, potentially leading to catalyst poisoning or less effective coordination.

9. **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yields due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Reactive aldehyde groups may form irreversible adducts with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalytic sites.

10. **Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yields when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocycle; those with additional aromatic rings or linkers yield low yields.**

    - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to the heterocycle enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing catalyst interactions. Additional linkers or aromatic rings can disrupt optimal coordination geometry.

11. **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings yield high yields due to increased electron density enhancing metal coordination.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are strong electron donors, increasing electron density on the aromatic ring and adjacent functional groups, which can improve metal-ligand interactions critical for catalysis.

12. **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated yield low yields due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Acylation of amino groups diminishes their nucleophilicity and ability to coordinate with metal centers, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

13. **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yields due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups such as sulfides or methylthioethers can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

14. **Modifiers with oxo (carbonyl) groups within a rigid aromatic framework yield high yields; similar modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains yield low yields.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Rigid structures facilitate effective coordination due to fixed geometry, while flexibility can impede proper alignment of coordinating groups with the metal center.

15. **Modifiers combining flexible ether linkages and terminal amino groups yield low yields due to excessive flexibility hindering effective coordination.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: The combination of ether linkages and amino groups introduces too much flexibility, preventing effective simultaneous coordination necessary for enhancing catalyst performance.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully formulated by analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the reaction yield. Each rule illustrates combinations of functional groups and structural features in the modifiers that correlate with high or low yields. By applying these rules, one can predict the expected yield outcome for any new molecular modifier fitting the described criteria, aiding in the optimization and control of the reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 1**'s SMARTS pattern does not correctly match α-amino dicarboxylic acids like aspartic acid and glutamic acid. The current pattern `"[NX3,NX4+][CX4]([CX3](=O)[O;H1,-])[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]"` incorrectly assumes that the α-carbon is directly connected to two carboxylic acid groups, which is not the case. The α-carbon in these amino acids is connected to an amino group, a carboxylic acid group, and a side chain containing another carboxylic acid group. **Suggestion**: Update the SMARTS pattern to accurately reflect this structure. A possible pattern is `"[NX3,NX4+][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[O;H1,-])[CX4H1][CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]"`, where the side chain `[CX4H1][CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]` represents the additional carboxylic acid group attached via a methylene linker.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Rule 2**'s SMARTS pattern `c1cc(ccc1C(=O)[O;H1,-])[$(N),$(N(=O)=O),$(CBr),$(BrC)]` uses incorrect SMARTS syntax for specifying substituents and their positions. The use of `$(N)` and similar constructs is not appropriate here. **Suggestion**: Correct the pattern to specify para-substituted benzoic acids with coordinating or electron-withdrawing groups. A revised pattern could be `"[cH]1cc([NX3H2,NX4H3+,N+](=O)[O-],CBr)ccc1C(=O)[O;H1,-]"` to match amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Rule 2.1** for low-yield para-substituted benzoic acids also has incorrect SMARTS syntax. **Suggestion**: Modify the pattern to `"[cH]1cc([CH3,C(=O)[H],SX2H])ccc1C(=O)[O;H1,-]"` to match methyl, formyl, or sulfanyl substituents at the para position.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Rule 3**'s pattern `"[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-][CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])"` is too specific and might miss compounds with fewer adjacent hydroxyl groups. **Suggestion**: Generalize the pattern to detect at least two adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid. A modified pattern could be `"[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-][CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])"`.

- **Suggestion 5**: In **Rule 3.1**, the exclusion of molecules with multiple adjacent hydroxyls is critical. Ensure that the `exclude_patterns` correctly prevent molecules matching Rule 3 from being labeled as low yield. **Suggestion**: Use the same generalized pattern from Suggestion 4 in the `exclude_patterns` to accurately exclude high-yield modifiers.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Rule 4**'s pattern `"[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]"` may not accurately capture chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons, especially regarding the inclusion of the carboxyl carbon. **Suggestion**: Adjust the pattern to account for the entire chain length, including the carboxyl group. For example, use `"[CH3][CH2]{5,7}C(=O)[O;H1,-]"` to represent acids with total chain lengths (including the carbonyl carbon) of 6 to 8 carbons.

- **Suggestion 7**: For **Rule 4.1**, the pattern `"[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-][*][NX3,NX4+,OX2H,SX2H]"` needs refinement. The pattern incorrectly assumes that polar functional groups are directly attached to the carboxylic acid carbon. **Suggestion**: Modify the pattern to detect any polar functional groups along the chain, such as `"[CH3][CH2]{0,6}[CH]([NX3,NX4+,OX2H,SX2H])[CH2]{0,6}[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]"`.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Rule 5** aims to identify amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms, but the current pattern `"[NX3,NX4+][CX4][CX3](=O)[O;H1,-][CX4H2][c][n,o,s]"` might miss some valid molecules. **Suggestion**: Broaden the pattern to include aromatic rings with heteroatoms, such as `"[NX3,NX4+][CX4H][CX3](=O)[O;H1,-][CX4][c][c][c][n,o,s]"`, ensuring it captures a variety of side chains like those in tryptophan.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Rule 6**'s pattern `([#6][OX2]){2,}[#6]` needs refinement as it may not accurately capture flexible ether linkages. **Suggestion**: Adjust the pattern to `"[#6][OX2][#6][OX2][#6]"` to detect two or more consecutive ether linkages representing flexibility.

- **Suggestion 10**: In **Rule 7**, the pattern `"[CX4]([F])([F])([F])"` only detects trifluoromethyl groups, not longer perfluoroalkyl chains as described in the rule. **Suggestion**: Expand the pattern to detect perfluoroalkyl chains of varying lengths, such as `"[CX4]([F])([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[F]"` or more generally `"[CX4]([F])([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[*]"`.

- **Suggestion 11**: For **Rule 9**, the pattern `"[CX3H](=O)[#6]"` may misidentify ketones instead of aldehydes. **Suggestion**: Use a pattern like `"[#6][CX3H](=O)"` to match aldehyde groups where the carbonyl carbon is attached to at least one hydrogen.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Rule 10**'s pattern `"[n][cH][cH][cH][cH][cH][CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]"` is too restrictive and may not match all target molecules. **Suggestion**: Simplify the pattern to detect any nitrogen-containing heterocycle directly bonded to a carboxyl group, such as `"[n][c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH]1C(=O)[O;H1,-]"`.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Rule 11** detects modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings. The pattern `"[c][OX2][CH3]"` might match non-aromatic oxygens. **Suggestion**: Refine the pattern to `"[c][OX2H0][CH3]"` to ensure that the oxygen is a methoxy group and not a hydroxyl.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Rule 13**'s pattern `"[NX3,NX4+][CX4][CX3](=O)[O;H1,-][CX4H2][CX4][SX2][#6]"` may not capture all amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains. **Suggestion**: Adjust the pattern to `"[NX3,NX4+][CX4H][CX3](=O)[O;H1,-][CX4][CX4][SX2][#6]"` to account for side chains like methionine.

- **Suggestion 15**: For **Rule 15**, the pattern `"[NX3H2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]"` may not correctly detect modifiers combining flexible ether linkages and terminal amino groups. **Suggestion**: Ensure the pattern reflects terminal amino groups connected via ether linkages to the carboxylic acid, using `"[NX3H2][CX4H2][OX2][CX4H2][OX2][CX4][CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]"`.

- **Suggestion 16**: **General Recommendation**: Verify all SMARTS patterns using RDKit or another cheminformatics tool to ensure they match the intended structures. Consider drawing example molecules and testing the patterns against them. Also, ensure that the syntax used in the SMARTS patterns adheres to standard conventions to avoid misinterpretation.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **
- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Consolidate Rules Based on Quantifiable Molecular Features**

  Simplify the existing rules by focusing on easily quantifiable molecular features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. Consolidate similar rules to create a more manageable and general set of guidelines. For example, combine rules related to coordinating functional groups such as carboxylic acids, amino groups, hydroxyls, and thiols into broader categories based on the number and type of these groups.

- **Advice 2**: **Develop Rules Using Quantifiable Molecular Descriptors**

  Utilize quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be calculated automatically using cheminformatics tools. Descriptors such as the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of rotatable bonds, aromatic ring count, and molecular rigidity can be used to create rules that are easily translated into numeric features for modeling.

- **Advice 3**: **Implement Substructure Searches for Functional Group Identification**

  Use substructure patterns to identify the presence of key functional groups or motifs within the modifiers. Create rules based on the presence or absence of these substructures (e.g., alpha-amino acids, aromatic carboxylic acids, heterocyclic rings with nitrogen atoms). Encode these as binary features to simplify feature matrix generation.

- **Advice 4**: **Group Modifiers by Structural Similarity and Yield Outcomes**

  Analyze the dataset to group modifiers with similar structural features and corresponding yield outcomes. Identify common patterns among high-yield and low-yield modifiers to streamline the rules. This grouping can reveal overarching trends and reduce the complexity of the rule set.

- **Advice 5**: **Utilize Cheminformatics Tools for Descriptor Calculation and Statistical Analysis**

  Employ cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit, ChemAxon) to calculate a wide range of molecular descriptors for the modifiers. Perform statistical analyses, such as correlation studies or machine learning feature importance rankings, to identify which descriptors most strongly influence the yield. Use these insights to refine and prioritize the rules.

- **Advice 6**: **Reevaluate and Remove Overly Specific or Redundant Rules**

  Examine the current rules for specificity and redundancy. Rules that are too specific may not generalize well, while redundant rules can cause confusion. Streamline the rule set by focusing on general principles that apply across multiple modifiers, enhancing both practicality and clarity.

- **Advice 7**: **Quantify Electronic Effects Using Established Parameters**

  Incorporate quantifiable measures of electronic effects, such as Hammett sigma constants for substituents on aromatic rings. This allows for a numerical representation of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects, which can be directly included in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 8**: **Quantify Molecular Flexibility and Rigidity**

  Use descriptors like the number of rotatable bonds to quantify molecular flexibility, and the presence of ring systems to indicate rigidity. This numerical approach facilitates the inclusion of these properties in the feature matrix and helps assess their impact on yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Develop a Core Set of Numerical Features**

  Establish a core set of features that are directly extractable from SMILES strings and can be represented numerically, such as:
  - Counts of specific atom types (e.g., N, O, S)
  - Counts of functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amino groups, hydroxyls)
  - Molecular weight
  - Log P (octanol-water partition coefficient) for hydrophobicity
  - Number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors
  - Aromatic ring count

  These features enable straightforward generation of a numeric feature matrix suitable for modeling.

- **Advice 10**: **Map Rules to Specific SMILES Patterns and Descriptors**

  Provide clear instructions on how each rule corresponds to specific features in the SMILES representation. For instance:
  - Identify carboxylic acid groups by the substructure "C(=O)O"
  - Detect amino groups with "N" connected to a non-carbonyl carbon
  - Recognize hydroxyl groups attached to sp³ carbons with "CO"

  This mapping ensures that rules are practical and readily implementable using computational methods.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*).
   - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity through effective chelation.

2. **Para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yields when the para-substituent is a coordinating heteroatom (e.g., amino, nitro) or a halogenated methyl group; substituents like methyl, formyl, or thiol yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Coordinating heteroatoms and electron-withdrawing groups enhance metal-ligand interactions by increasing electron deficiency, improving catalyst performance. Electron-donating groups like methyl or reactive groups like thiol can reduce effectiveness or cause catalyst poisoning, leading to lower yields.

3. **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxylic acid yield high yields; modifiers with single or distant hydroxyl groups yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*).
   - *Low Yield Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with metal centers due to increased coordination sites, improving catalyst effectiveness. Distant or fewer hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination.

4. **Unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons yield high yields; introduction of additional polar functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) lowers the yield.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted long-chain acids facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst surface without steric hindrance from additional functional groups, enhancing catalytic activity. Polar substituents may interfere with these interactions or lead to undesired coordination, resulting in lower yields.

5. **Amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms yield high yields; those without such heteroatoms yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
   - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
   - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms do not offer this advantage.

6. **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages yield low yields due to decreased coordination efficiency and increased conformational flexibility.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: The flexibility introduced by ether linkages can hinder optimal alignment of coordinating groups with metal centers, reducing the effectiveness of catalyst modification.

7. **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl chains yield low yields due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms (e.g., oxygen in carboxyl groups) to donate electron density to metal ions, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

8. **Modifiers with thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yields if aliphatic; if aromatic, they yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may interact differently or cause catalyst poisoning, resulting in lower yields.

9. **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yields due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Reactive aldehyde groups may form irreversible adducts with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalytic sites.

10. **Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yields when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocycle; those with additional aromatic rings or linkers yield low yields.**

    - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to the heterocycle enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing catalyst interactions. Additional linkers or aromatic rings can disrupt optimal coordination geometry.

11. **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings can yield high yields; however, the position and number of methoxy groups are important.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are strong electron donors, increasing electron density on the aromatic ring and adjacent functional groups, which can improve metal-ligand interactions critical for catalysis. However, insufficient number or improper positioning may not provide the desired effect.

12. **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated yield low yields due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Acylation of amino groups diminishes their nucleophilicity and ability to coordinate with metal centers, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

13. **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yields due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups such as sulfides or methylthioethers can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and deactivating the catalyst.

14. **Modifiers with rigid aromatic systems containing additional coordination sites (e.g., carbonyl groups) adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high yields.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Rigid structures facilitate effective coordination due to fixed geometry and proximity of the carbonyl groups to the carboxyl group, enhancing metal binding. Flexible aliphatic chains may not position coordinating groups optimally.

15. **Modifiers with terminal amino groups on flexible aliphatic chains yield low yields due to ineffective coordination and potential interference with catalyst sites.**

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Terminal amino groups on flexible chains may not effectively coordinate with metal centers and can interfere with catalyst activity by occupying active sites without contributing to catalysis.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Rule 5 by gathering more supporting data or consider merging it with related rules to improve coverage and reliability.**

  *Rationale*: Rule 5 lacks sufficient coverage, with only one high-yield and one low-yield example. To strengthen this rule, additional data points featuring amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms should be collected. Alternatively, consider combining Rule 5 with other rules that address similar structural features affecting coordination to increase robustness.

- **Advice 2**: **Reevaluate Rule 8 due to minimal data support; consider merging it with Rule 13 or generalizing it to include other sulfur-containing modifiers.**

  *Rationale*: Rule 8 is based on limited data, with only one high-yield and one low-yield example. To enhance its reliability, integrate it with Rule 13, which also addresses sulfur-containing modifiers. A combined rule could more effectively capture the influence of thiol and sulfur-containing groups on yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Revise Rule 10 to account for exceptions and improve accuracy by analyzing contradictory data points like 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.**

  *Rationale*: Rule 10 is contradicted by the high-yield obtained with 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, despite it having an additional linker. Reassess the structural features influencing yield in such compounds and refine the rule to include factors like linker length, flexibility, or additional coordinating sites that might contribute to high yields.

- **Advice 4**: **Clarify Rule 11 by specifying how the position and number of methoxy groups affect yield and support it with additional examples.**

  *Rationale*: Rule 11 lacks clarity on which positions and quantities of methoxy groups are beneficial. Expand the rule to detail the optimal positioning (e.g., ortho, meta, para) and the number of methoxy groups required for high yield. Provide more data points to validate the rule and enhance its practical applicability.

- **Advice 5**: **Strengthen Rule 12 by providing contrasting high-yield examples and reassessing its scope and impact on yield.**

  *Rationale*: Rule 12 is based on a single low-yield example and lacks high-yield counterparts. To validate the rule, include examples of modifiers with free amino groups that yield high results. This contrast will reinforce the rule's premises regarding acylation reducing coordination ability.

- **Advice 6**: **Enhance Rule 13 by collecting more data on amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains or integrate it with Rule 8 to address sulfur effects comprehensively.**

  *Rationale*: With only one supporting data point, Rule 13's reliability is limited. Accumulate more examples of sulfur-containing amino acids to confirm the rule. Alternatively, merge it with Rule 8 to create a broader rule on sulfur-containing modifiers and their general impact on catalyst performance.

- **Advice 7**: **Reconsider Rule 14 due to low coverage; gather more data or combine it with other rules focusing on molecular rigidity and coordination.**

  *Rationale*: Rule 14 is supported by minimal data, reducing its effectiveness. Collect more examples of rigid and flexible modifiers with oxo groups to validate the rule. Consider integrating it with existing rules that address rigidity's role in coordination to form a more comprehensive guideline.

- **Advice 8**: **Prioritize rules with strong data support, and consider consolidating or removing rules with insufficient coverage to improve the overall rule set's reliability.**

  *Rationale*: Focusing on well-supported rules enhances predictive accuracy. Consolidating rules with overlapping themes or insufficient data will streamline the rule set, making it more user-friendly and dependable for practical applications.

- **Advice 9**: **Ensure all rules have clear, specific criteria with ample supporting examples to facilitate effective application and interpretation.**

  *Rationale*: Clear criteria and sufficient examples improve a rule's clarity and usability. Explicit details help users accurately classify modifiers and predict yields, thereby optimizing reaction outcomes.

- **Advice 10**: **Incorporate quantitative descriptors or thresholds where possible to enhance rule precision and reduce ambiguity.**

  *Rationale*: Including quantitative parameters, such as specific chain lengths, exact positions of functional groups, or numerical electron-withdrawing/donating capacities, can make rules more precise. This reduces subjective interpretation and improves consistency in applying the rules.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Functional Groups and Structural Features**

  Transform qualitative descriptions of functional groups into quantitative numerical features. Assign counts to specific functional groups (e.g., number of carboxylic acids, hydroxyls, amino groups, thiols) and structural features (e.g., ring systems, chain lengths). This will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix and improve the analysis.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints**

  Compute molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and rotatable bonds. Additionally, generate molecular fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) from the SMILES strings to capture substructural information numerically.

- **Advice 3**: **Standardize and Clarify Definitions in Rules**

  Ensure that all rules use standardized and unambiguous terminology. For instance, define what constitutes "adjacent hydroxyl groups," "flexible ether linkages," or "rigid aromatic systems" in precise chemical terms that can be identified and counted. This clarity will aid in consistent data encoding.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Electronic Effects Numerically**

  Quantify electronic effects of substituents using parameters like Hammett sigma constants or Taft inductive constants. These values numerically represent electron-donating or electron-withdrawing nature of groups, allowing for more precise modeling of their impact on yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Implement a Data-Driven Approach**

  Use statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the dataset and identify patterns not captured by the current rules. Feature selection algorithms can help determine which molecular features most significantly influence yield, leading to more effective and generalizable rules.

- **Advice 6**: **Reevaluate and Simplify Overlapping Rules**

  Review the rules for redundancies and conflicts. For example, Rules 8 and 13 both address sulfur-containing modifiers but have different outcomes based on structural context. Combining or refining these rules to reduce overlap will improve their applicability and ease of use.

- **Advice 7**: **Create a Hierarchical Rule Framework**

  Organize the rules into a hierarchical structure where general rules are supplemented by specific sub-rules. This approach allows for exceptions to be handled systematically and makes the rules more adaptable to a wider range of modifiers.

- **Advice 8**: **Include Steric Factors Numerically**

  Quantify steric hindrance by calculating parameters such as molar refractivity or using Sterimol parameters. These numerical values can account for the impact of bulky groups on catalyst interaction and reaction yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Enhance Rules with 3D Structural Information**

  Incorporate three-dimensional molecular descriptors, such as molecular volume or shape indices, to capture spatial effects that influence catalyst-modifier interactions. Tools like computational docking simulations could provide insights into the modifier's orientation and binding efficiency.

    - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
    - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity.

11. **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated yield low yields due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Acylation diminishes nucleophilicity of amino groups, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

12. **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings can yield high yields; however, the position and number of methoxy groups are important.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Optimal positioning is crucial for effective coordination.

13. **Modifiers with rigid aromatic systems containing additional carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high yields.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Rigid structures with multiple coordination sites enhance metal binding due to fixed geometry and proximity of functional groups.

14. **Modifiers with terminal amino groups on flexible aliphatic chains yield low yields due to ineffective coordination and potential interference with catalyst sites.**

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Flexible chains may not position amino groups optimally for coordination, and terminal amino groups may occupy active sites without contributing to catalysis.

15. **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yields due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and reducing catalyst activity.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: The rule clearly identifies α-amino dicarboxylic acids as modifiers that yield high yields. The rationale provides solid physicochemical insight into how multiple coordination sites enhance catalyst stability and reactivity through effective chelation. The rule combines substructures (α-amino group and two carboxylic acids), satisfying complexity. Coverage is adequate with at least two supporting data points (aspartic acid and glutamic acid).

- **Comment 2**: This rule clearly distinguishes between para-substituted benzoic acids based on the electron-withdrawing nature of the substituent. The rationale offers property insight by explaining how electron-withdrawing groups enhance metal-ligand interactions, improving catalyst binding. Complexity is addressed by considering both the position and type of substituent. Coverage is strong with multiple high and low yield examples provided.

- **Comment 3**: The rule is clear in stating that modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains yield high yields, whereas those with single or distant hydroxyl groups yield low yields. The rationale provides adequate physicochemical insight into enhanced chelation due to increased coordination sites. Complexity is present as the rule considers combinations of substructures. Coverage is sufficient with supporting examples like gluconic acid (high yield) and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (low yield).

- **Comment 4**: This rule clearly indicates that unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons yield high yields, while the introduction of polar functional groups lowers the yield. The rationale offers insight into how hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface enhance activity. Complexity is achieved by considering both chain length and the absence of polar substituents. Coverage is adequate with examples such as octanoic acid (high yield) and 7-aminoheptanoic acid (low yield).

- **Comment 5**: The rule clearly states that modifiers containing flexible ether linkages yield low yields. The rationale provides physicochemical insight into decreased coordination efficiency and increased conformational flexibility hindering optimal alignment with metal centers. Complexity is addressed by focusing on specific structural features (ether linkages). Coverage is sufficient with examples like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (both low yield).

- **Comment 6**: This rule clearly identifies modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl chains, as yielding low yields. The rationale explains how decreased electron density on coordinating atoms weakens metal-ligand interactions. Complexity is present by considering specific functional groups. Coverage is adequate with examples like 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid (both low yield).

- **Comment 7**: The rule clearly distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic modifiers containing thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid. The rationale provides insight into potential catalyst poisoning by aromatic thiols. Complexity is addressed by considering both the functional group and the structural context (aliphatic vs. aromatic). Coverage is sufficient with examples like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield).

- **Comment 8**: This rule clearly states that modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yields due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions. The rationale offers adequate physicochemical insight. Complexity is acceptable, focusing on a specific functional group. Coverage is adequate with low yield examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Comment 9**: The rule is clear in stating that nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yields when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocycle, whereas additional aromatic rings or linkers yield low yields. The rationale provides property insight into effective bidentate coordination enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Complexity is present by considering structural connectivity. Coverage is sufficient with examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (high yield) versus 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (low yield).

- **Comment 10**: This rule clearly indicates that amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms yield high yields, while those without heteroatoms yield low yields. The rationale offers physicochemical insight into the importance of additional coordination sites. Complexity is addressed by combining amino acid structure with side-chain functional groups. Coverage is adequate with examples like tryptophan (high yield) and phenylalanine (low yield).

- **Comment 11**: The rule states that modifiers where amino groups are acylated yield low yields. The rationale explains how acylation reduces the availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination. While the rule is clear and offers property insight, coverage is limited with only one supporting data point (6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid). Additional data points are needed to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 12**: This rule mentions that modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings can yield high yields, with the position and number of methoxy groups being important. The rationale provides some insight but could be elaborated. Complexity is present by considering substituent type and positioning. Coverage is limited with one high yield example and one low yield example; more data points would enhance the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 13**: The rule clearly states that modifiers with rigid aromatic systems containing additional carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high yields. The rationale offers physicochemical insight into how rigid structures with multiple coordination sites enhance metal binding. Complexity is addressed through the combination of structural features. However, coverage is limited with only one high yield example (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid); more supporting data would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 14**: This rule clearly indicates that modifiers with terminal amino groups on flexible aliphatic chains yield low yields due to ineffective coordination. The rationale provides adequate insight. Complexity is acceptable, focusing on chain flexibility and functional group positioning. Coverage is sufficient with supporting examples like 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid (both low yield).

- **Comment 15**: The rule states that amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yields due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation. While the rationale is reasonable, coverage is limited with only one low yield example provided (2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid). Additional data points are necessary to validate this rule fully.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*).
   - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity through effective chelation.

2. **Para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yields when the para-substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., amino, nitro, halomethyl); substituents like methyl, formyl, or thiol yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance metal-ligand interactions by increasing the electrophilicity of the aromatic ring, improving catalyst binding. Electron-donating groups or those that can interfere with metal coordination reduce effectiveness.

3. **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains yield high yields; those with single or distant hydroxyl groups yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]-2-oxoacetic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with metal centers due to increased coordination sites, improving catalyst effectiveness. Isolated hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination.

4. **Unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons yield high yields; introduction of polar functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) lowers the yield.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted aliphatic chains favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing activity. Polar substituents may interfere with these interactions or lead to undesired coordination, resulting in lower yields.

5. **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages yield low yields due to decreased coordination efficiency and increased conformational flexibility.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: The flexibility introduced by ether linkages can hinder optimal alignment of coordinating groups with metal centers, reducing the effectiveness of catalyst modification.

6. **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl chains yield low yields due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms to donate electron density to metal ions, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

7. **Modifiers with thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yields if aliphatic; if aromatic, they yield low yields due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or irreversibly, causing deactivation.

8. **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yields due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Reactive aldehyde groups may form adducts with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalytic sites.

9. **Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yields when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocycle; those with additional aromatic rings or linkers yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Direct attachment enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Additional linkers can disrupt optimal geometry.

10. **Amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms yield high yields; those without heteroatoms yield low yields.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
    - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
    - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity.

11. **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated yield low yields due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Acylation diminishes nucleophilicity of amino groups, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

12. **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings can yield high yields; however, the position and number of methoxy groups are important.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Optimal positioning is crucial for effective coordination.

13. **Modifiers with rigid aromatic systems containing additional carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high yields.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Rigid structures with multiple coordination sites enhance metal binding due to fixed geometry and proximity of functional groups.

14. **Modifiers with terminal amino groups on flexible aliphatic chains yield low yields due to ineffective coordination and potential interference with catalyst sites.**

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Flexible chains may not position amino groups optimally for coordination, and terminal amino groups may occupy active sites without contributing to catalysis.

15. **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yields due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and reducing catalyst activity.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been formulated by analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple substructures (functional groups) to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield. By applying these rules, one can anticipate the expected yield outcome for any new SMILES structure fitting the described criteria, aiding in the optimization and control of the reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correction for Rule 1 Implementation**

  - **Issue**: In the code, Rule 1 is intended to identify molecules that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids. The current implementation uses only the `alpha_amino_acid` SMARTS pattern, which matches any α-amino acid backbone with a single carboxylic acid group. Additionally, the `counts` parameter is set to `[1, 2]`, but only one pattern is provided, leading to an inconsistency.

  - **Suggestion**: Modify the patterns and counts to accurately reflect the requirement for an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups. Specifically:
    - Add a separate SMARTS pattern for the carboxylic acid group (`carboxylic_acid_any = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`) and include it in the patterns list.
    - Update the `patterns` and `counts` for Rule 1 as follows:
      ```python
      {
          'number': 1,
          'description': 'Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yields.',
          'patterns': [
              alpha_amino_acid,
              carboxylic_acid_any
          ],
          'counts': [1, 2],  # At least 1 alpha amino group, at least 2 carboxylic acids
          'prediction': 1
      }
      ```
    - Ensure that the code correctly iterates over the patterns and their corresponding counts.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Enhance Rule 2 to Accurately Capture Substituents**

  - **Issue**: In Rule 2, the code checks for para-substituted benzoic acids with specific substituents. However, the SMARTS pattern `'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])cc1*'` may not correctly match only para-substituted benzoic acids, and the substituents are not accurately checked at the para position.

  - **Suggestion**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to specifically target para-substituted benzoic acids and ensure substituents are correctly identified at the para position. For example:
    - Use the SMARTS pattern for para-substituted benzoic acids: `'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1[!H]'`
    - Create separate SMARTS patterns for high-yield and low-yield substituents at the para position:
      ```python
      para_position = '[c:1]1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1[*:2]'
      high_yield_substituents = ['[NX3;H2]', '[NX3+](=O)[O-]', '[CH2][F,Cl,Br,I]']
      low_yield_substituents = ['[CH3]', aldehyde_group, thiol_group]
      ```
    - Update the code to match substituents at the para position and determine high or low yield based on the matched substituent.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine Rule 3 to Detect Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups**

  - **Issue**: The current implementation for Rule 3 only checks for the presence of hydroxyl groups and then checks adjacency by computing the shortest path between hydroxyl oxygens. However, this approach may not accurately capture multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains.

  - **Suggestion**: Implement a SMARTS pattern that specifically matches multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains. For example:
    - Use a recursive SMARTS pattern to identify aliphatic chains with at least two adjacent hydroxyl groups:
      ```python
      polyol = '[CX4;!$(C=O)](-[OX2H])(-[OX2H])'  # Carbon with two hydroxyl groups
      ```
    - Alternatively, for linear chains with consecutive hydroxyls:
      ```python
      polyol = '[CX4;!$(C=O)](-[OX2H])-[CX4;!$(C=O)](-[OX2H])'  # Two adjacent carbons each bearing a hydroxyl group
      ```
    - Modify Rule 3 to use this pattern and set the prediction to 1 for matches:
      ```python
      {
          'number': 3,
          'description': 'Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains yield high yields; those with single or distant hydroxyl groups yield low yields.',
          'patterns': [
              polyol
          ],
          'prediction': 1
      }
      ```
    - Remove the adjacency check in the code since the SMARTS pattern ensures adjacency.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Correct Rule 4 to Exclude Substituted Aliphatic Chains**

  - **Issue**: In Rule 4, the code uses the pattern `'[CCCCCC,CCCCCCC,CCCCCCCC]'` to identify aliphatic chains of 6-8 carbons but does not ensure that the chains are unsubstituted. Additionally, the exclude patterns may not fully capture all polar functional groups.

  - **Suggestion**: Modify the pattern to match linear aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons without substitutions:
    - Use a SMARTS pattern for linear unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids:
      ```python
      aliphatic_chain = '[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[C](=O)[OX2H1]'
      ```
    - Ensure that there are no substitutions on the chain:
      ```python
      no_substituents = '[$([CX4H3][CX4H2]{4,6}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1])]'  # Unsubstituted chain
      ```
    - Update Rule 4 patterns and exclude patterns:
      ```python
      {
          'number': 4,
          'description': 'Unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons yield high yields; introduction of polar functional groups lowers the yield.',
          'patterns': [
              no_substituents
          ],
          'exclude_patterns': [],
          'prediction': 1
      }
      ```
    - Remove the previous exclude patterns, as the SMARTS pattern ensures no substitutions.

- **Suggestion 5**: **General Code Improvements**

  - **Issue**: The code may not handle exceptions or parsing errors effectively, and some rules may not be correctly applied due to the way the code is structured.

  - **Suggestion**:
    - Add error handling to catch exceptions during pattern matching or molecule parsing.
    - Ensure that for each rule, the code precisely follows the logic described in the natural language rule.
    - Use more descriptive variable names and comments to improve code readability.
    - Consider using RDKit's molecular queries and properties where appropriate to enhance pattern matching accuracy.
    - Implement unit tests for each rule to validate the correctness of the SMARTS patterns and code logic.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**1. Comparison of Current Metrics with Reference Metrics**

To assess the performance of the current rules, we'll compare the current training metrics to the reference (previous) metrics, focusing on **confidence** and **lift** as per the instructions.

**a. Confidence**

- **Previous Train Confidence (Average):**
  - Metric 1: 0.6352
  - Metric 2: 0.5396
  - **Average Previous Train Confidence:** (0.6352 + 0.5396) / 2 = **0.5874**

- **Current Train Confidence:**
  - Metric: **0.6536**

**Observation:** The current train confidence (0.6536) has improved compared to the average previous train confidence (0.5874). This suggests that the current rules are more reliable in predicting the outcome (high or low yield) when the rule conditions are met.

**b. Lift**

- **Previous Train Lift (Average):**
  - Metric 1: 1.2048
  - Metric 2: 1.0559
  - **Average Previous Train Lift:** (1.2048 + 1.0559) / 2 = **1.1304**

- **Current Train Lift:**
  - Metric: **1.2949**

**Observation:** The current train lift (1.2949) is higher than the average previous train lift (1.1304). A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule has better predictive power than random chance. The higher the lift, the stronger the association between the rule conditions and the prediction.

---

**2. Evaluation of Current Rule Performance**

**a. Improved Predictive Power**

- The increase in **confidence** and **lift** indicates that the current rules are performing better than the previous ones in the training data.
- **Confidence** has increased by approximately **6.6%** from the previous average, suggesting a higher proportion of correct predictions when the rule conditions are satisfied.
- **Lift** has increased by approximately **14.5%**, indicating a stronger association between the rule conditions and high yields.

**b. Support and Leverage**

- **Support:** The current train support is **0.1571**, which is slightly lower than the previous average train support of **0.1756**. This means that the current rules apply to a somewhat smaller portion of the dataset.
- **Leverage:** The current train leverage is **0.0076**, which is lower than the previous average of **0.0124**. While leverage is not the primary focus, a lower leverage might suggest that the rules are capturing less of the dataset than before.

**c. Absence of Test Metrics**

- The current iteration lacks test metrics. Without test confidence and lift, it's challenging to assess how well the rules generalize to unseen data.
- Previous test confidences were **0.3333** and **0.4639**, and lifts were **0.6889** and **0.9137**, both below 1, indicating poor generalization.
- It's essential to validate the current rules on test data to ensure they are not overfitting.

---

**3. Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

**a. Possibility of Overfitting**

- The improvement in training metrics without corresponding test metrics raises the concern of overfitting.
- Overfitting occurs when rules perform well on training data but poorly on unseen data.

**b. Local Minimum**

- A local minimum refers to a point where further iterations do not significantly improve performance or might even degrade it.
- Given the incremental improvements in confidence and lift, and the lack of test metrics, it's possible that the current rules are approaching a local minimum for training data.
- However, without test metrics, we cannot conclusively determine if we have reached a local minimum in overall model performance.

**c. Need for Further Iterations**

- To ascertain if a local minimum has been reached, we should:
  - Evaluate the current rules on test data.
  - If test metrics improve correspondingly, it suggests that further iterations may still be beneficial.
  - If test metrics do not improve or degrade, it might indicate that we are overfitting, and additional iterations may yield diminishing returns.

---

**4. Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

**a. Validate with Test Data**

- **Immediate Action:** Evaluate the current rules using test data to obtain test confidence and lift.
- **Rationale:** This will provide insights into how well the rules generalize and whether overfitting is occurring.

**b. Analyze Rule Specificity and Generalization**

- **Simplify Overly Specific Rules:**
  - Some current rules may be too specific, capturing nuances that only apply to the training set.
  - **Example:** Rules with numerous conditions or focusing on rare substructures may not generalize well.
- **Enhance Generalizable Features:**
  - Identify common functional groups or structural motifs associated with high yields across diverse molecules.
  - **Focus on Key Contributors:** Prioritize functional groups that consistently show strong association with high yields in both training and test sets.

**c. Incorporate Test Feedback into Rule Refinement**

- **Iterative Refinement:**
  - Use test data metrics to refine rules that do not generalize well.
  - **Adjust Rule Thresholds:** Modify confidence and support thresholds to balance rule generality and specificity.
- **Prune Underperforming Rules:**
  - Remove or adjust rules that contribute little to predictive performance or negatively impact test metrics.

**d. Employ Cross-Validation**

- **Cross-Validation Techniques:**
  - Implement k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance more robustly.
  - **Benefit:** Provides a better estimate of how the rules will perform on unseen data and helps prevent overfitting.

**e. Examine Rule Overlap and Redundancy**

- **Reduce Redundancy:**
  - Identify and merge rules that cover similar chemical spaces or yield predictions.
  - **Optimize Rule Set Size:** A smaller, more effective set of rules can improve interpretability and performance.
- **Evaluate Interactions Between Rules:**
  - Assess if certain rules conflict or interfere with each other.
  - **Adjust Rule Hierarchy:** Prioritize rules based on their predictive power and confidence levels.

**f. Incorporate Domain Knowledge**

- **Leverage Chemical Expertise:**
  - Consult with chemists to validate the chemical rationale behind the rules.
  - **Identify Missing Factors:** There may be important chemical factors not captured by the current rules (e.g., steric hindrance, solvent effects).

**g. Monitor for Bias**

- **Assess Dataset Balance:**
  - Ensure that the training data is balanced with respect to high and low yields.
  - **Address Imbalances:** If the data is skewed, it may bias the rules and impact generalization.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules show improved performance in terms of train confidence and lift compared to previous iterations. However, the absence of test metrics makes it difficult to determine if these improvements will generalize to new data or if overfitting is occurring. To enhance the current rules and ensure their effectiveness:

1. **Validate the rules on test data** to obtain a clear picture of their generalization performance.
2. **Refine the rules** by simplifying overly specific conditions and focusing on generalizable features.
3. **Use cross-validation** to prevent overfitting and to achieve a more reliable assessment of rule performance.
4. **Iteratively improve the rules** by incorporating feedback from test metrics and leveraging chemical domain knowledge.

By following these steps, we can improve the predictive power of the rules while ensuring they remain robust and generalizable to new data.

**Performance Analysis of Current Rules**

1. **Evaluation of Effectiveness:**

   The current set of rules appears to be less effective than desired. The latest validation accuracy has decreased to **0.4286**, which is significantly lower than previous accuracies that were as high as **0.76**. This decline in performance suggests that the current rules may not be adequately capturing the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions.

2. **Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   The fluctuating accuracies across different iterations indicate potential instability in the model. The inconsistency suggests that the model may be **overfitting** to specific features captured by certain rules or **underfitting** by not capturing essential patterns. The high variance in validation accuracies implies that the model isn't generalizing well to unseen data.

3. **Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values:**

   By examining the SHAP values for misclassified molecules, we can identify problematic rules:

   - **Overestimations (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

     - *Example*: **C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**

       - **SHAP Values**: 
         - Rule1: **+0.1881**
         - Rule2: **+0.0142**

       - **Interpretation**: Rule1 contributes significantly to the incorrect high prediction due to its high positive SHAP value. This suggests that Rule1 may be too broadly defined or incorrectly emphasizing features leading to overestimation.

   - **Underestimations (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

     - *Example*: **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**

       - **SHAP Values**: 
         - Rule1: **-0.0230**
         - Rule2: **+0.0171**

       - **Interpretation**: Rule1 contributes negatively to the prediction of high loading, leading to underestimation. Rule2's positive SHAP value isn't sufficient to counteract the negative influence of Rule1.

   - Similar patterns are observed across other misclassified molecules, indicating that **Rule1** is a common factor in mispredictions.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics:**

   The decrease in validation accuracy from previous iterations suggests that the current rules do not improve the model's performance and may have reached a local minimum. The lack of consistent improvement despite multiple iterations indicates that the rules may need significant refinement or reevaluation.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Rule1** has high magnitude SHAP values (both positive and negative) in misclassified instances, implying that it heavily influences the model's predictions, often incorrectly.
   - **Rule2** generally has smaller SHAP values, indicating it has less impact on the model's decisions.
   - This imbalance suggests a need to adjust the influence of Rule1 and potentially enhance the contributions of other rules or introduce new ones.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule1 to Reduce Misclassifications:**

   - **Adjust Specificity**: Narrow down Rule1's criteria to be more specific. For example, if Rule1 currently states that "Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yields," consider specifying the exact positions or additional functional groups that are critical.
   - **Incorporate Exceptions**: Identify and exclude molecular structures that are incorrectly classified due to Rule1. Introduce conditions that prevent Rule1 from applying to molecules that do not truly meet its intended criteria.

2. **Balance Rule Contributions:**

   - Ensure that no single rule disproportionately affects the prediction. Adjust the feature matrix generation so that all rules contribute more evenly, possibly by normalizing the influence of each rule.
   - Reevaluate the weights assigned to each rule in the model, possibly reducing the weight of Rule1 and increasing weights for other underrepresented but relevant rules.

3. **Introduce New Rules Based on Misclassified Molecules:**

   - **Analyze Misclassified High Experimental Yield Molecules Predicted as Low**:
     - Identify common structural features among these molecules not currently captured by existing rules.
     - Develop new rules that account for these features.

   - **Example**: For molecules like **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**, which are underestimated, perhaps introduce a rule that recognizes the influence of halogen substitutions on the aromatic ring.

4. **Modify Rules with High Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations:**

   - Rules contributing negatively to high loading predictions in molecules with high experimental values need adjustment.
   - **Example**: If **Rule2** consistently has negative SHAP values in underestimations, refine it to better capture the positive influence these molecular features have on the catalyst loading.

5. **Improve Generalization to Address Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: Overly detailed rules may cause overfitting. Simplify rules to capture only the most critical features.
   - **Enhance Underrepresented Features**: Identify important molecular features not sufficiently represented in current rules and incorporate them to reduce underfitting.

6. **Iterative Testing and Validation:**

   - After adjusting the rules, retrain the model and monitor performance on both training and validation sets.
   - Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that improvements are genuine and not due to random fluctuations in the data.

7. **Leverage SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement:**

   - Use SHAP values to directly identify which rules are most influential in mispredictions and focus refinement efforts there.
   - **Example**: For molecules where **Rule1** has a high negative SHAP value in underestimations, investigate why the rule leads to negative contributions and adjust accordingly.

8. **Reassess the Validity of Current Rules:**

   - Critically evaluate each rule's rationale and its alignment with observed data.
   - Remove or substantially modify rules that do not have a strong theoretical justification or empirical support.

**Conclusion**

The current rules, especially **Rule1**, are contributing to significant mispredictions due to their disproportionate influence on the model. By refining these rules, balancing their contributions, and incorporating new insights from the SHAP analysis, we can enhance the model's performance. The goal is to develop a set of rules that more accurately reflects the underlying chemistry, leading to better generalization and higher predictive accuracy.

**Next Steps**

- Implement the recommended adjustments to **Rule1** and other identified rules.
- Introduce new rules to capture previously unaccounted molecular features.
- Retrain the model with the updated rules and perform rigorous validation.
- Continue to iteratively refine the rules based on ongoing SHAP analyses and performance metrics.

---

By following these recommendations, we aim to improve the model's accuracy and reliability, ultimately leading to more effective predictions of catalyst loading based on molecular structures.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Rule Optimization**

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction using various molecular modifiers has been thoroughly analyzed. Key findings and suggestions from the discussions are as follows:

1. **Issues Identified in Current Rule Implementations:**

   - **Rule 1 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids):** The implementation does not accurately detect molecules that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids. It uses only the α-amino acid SMARTS pattern without ensuring the presence of two carboxylic acid groups. Additionally, there's an inconsistency between patterns and counts.

   - **Rule 2 (Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids):** The SMARTS patterns may not correctly match only para-substituted benzoic acids with specific substituents. The substituents are not accurately checked at the para position, leading to incorrect classifications.

   - **Rule 3 (Polyols):** The method for detecting multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups may not accurately capture polyols with adjacent hydroxyls on aliphatic chains. The current approach might miss important modifiers or incorrectly classify them.

   - **Rule 4 (Unsubstituted Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids):** The patterns used do not ensure that the aliphatic chains are unsubstituted. The exclude patterns might not capture all polar functional groups, resulting in incorrect predictions.

2. **Specific Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

   - **Suggestion 1 (Correction for Rule 1 Implementation):**
     - **Modify Patterns and Counts:** Include separate SMARTS patterns for the α-amino group and multiple carboxylic acid groups. Update the `patterns` and `counts` to ensure both functional groups are present in the required quantities.
     - **Implementation:**
       ```python
       {
           'number': 1,
           'description': 'Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yields.',
           'patterns': [
               alpha_amino_acid,        # SMARTS for α-amino group
               carboxylic_acid_any      # SMARTS for carboxylic acid group
           ],
           'counts': [1, 2],            # At least 1 α-amino group, at least 2 carboxylic acids
           'prediction': 1
       }
       ```

   - **Suggestion 2 (Enhance Rule 2 to Accurately Capture Substituents):**
     - **Refine SMARTS Patterns:** Use specific patterns to target para-substituted benzoic acids and accurately identify substituents at the para position.
     - **Implementation:**
       ```python
       para_substituted_benzoic_acid = 'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1[!H]'
       high_yield_substituents = ['[NX3;H2]', '[NX3+](=O)[O-]', '[CH2][F,Cl,Br,I]']  # Amino, nitro, halomethyl
       low_yield_substituents = ['[CH3]', '[CX3H0](=O)[CH]', '[SX2H]']               # Methyl, formyl, thiol
       ```
     - **Include Checks:** Ensure substituents are matched at the para position and categorize yields based on the substituent type.

   - **Suggestion 3 (Refine Rule 3 to Detect Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups):**
     - **Use Specific SMARTS Patterns:** Implement patterns that match multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains without the need for adjacency checks in the code.
     - **Implementation:**
       ```python
       polyol = '[CX4;!$(C=O)](-[OX2H])-[CX4;!$(C=O)](-[OX2H])'
       ```
     - **Update Rule 3:** Use this pattern to identify modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups and predict high yields accordingly.

   - **Suggestion 4 (Correct Rule 4 to Exclude Substituted Aliphatic Chains):**
     - **Modify Patterns:** Match only unsubstituted linear aliphatic carboxylic acids of 6 to 8 carbons.
     - **Implementation:**
       ```python
       aliphatic_carboxylic_acid = '[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[C](=O)[OX2H1]'  # 6 to 8 carbons
       no_substituents = '[$([CX4H3][CX4H2]{4,6}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1])]' # Unsubstituted chain
       ```
     - **Exclude Substitutions:** Ensure the pattern does not match molecules with polar functional groups or substitutions.

   - **Suggestion 5 (General Code Improvements):**
     - **Add Error Handling:** Implement exception handling for molecule parsing and pattern matching.
     - **Enhance Code Readability:** Use descriptive variable names and comments.
     - **Implement Unit Tests:** Create tests for each rule to validate the correctness of SMARTS patterns and logic.
     - **Ensure Precise Logic:** Align the code implementation with the natural language descriptions of the rules.

3. **Analysis of Current Rule Performance:**

   - **Metrics Evaluation:**
     - **Training Metrics:** The current rules show improved training confidence (0.6536) and lift (1.2949) compared to previous averages, indicating better performance on the training data.
     - **Support and Leverage:** Slight decrease in support and leverage suggests the rules apply to a smaller portion of the data but are more precise.

   - **Overfitting Concerns:**
     - **Absence of Test Metrics:** Without test data metrics, it's challenging to assess the generalization of the rules.
     - **Risk of Overfitting:** Improved training metrics without corresponding test metrics may indicate overfitting.

   - **SHAP Analysis:**
     - **Influence of Rule 1:** High magnitude SHAP values for Rule 1 in misclassified instances suggest it disproportionately affects predictions.
     - **Misclassifications:** Both overestimations and underestimations are linked to Rule 1, highlighting the need for its refinement.

4. **Directions to Optimize Current Rules:**

   - **Implement Suggested Rule Corrections:** Apply the specific modifications to Rules 1 to 4 as detailed in the suggestions to ensure accurate pattern matching and prediction alignment with chemical rationale.

   - **Balance Rule Contributions:**
     - **Normalize Influence:** Adjust the weight or influence of each rule to prevent any single rule from dominating the predictions.
     - **Reevaluate Rule Hierarchy:** Prioritize rules based on their predictive power and confidence levels.

   - **Enhance Generalization:**
     - **Validate on Test Data:** Obtain test metrics to assess rule performance on unseen data.
     - **Use Cross-Validation:** Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well and to prevent overfitting.

   - **Refine Model Based on SHAP Analysis:**
     - **Focus on Misclassified Molecules:** Use SHAP values to identify and adjust rules contributing to misclassifications.
     - **Adjust Rule 1:** Since Rule 1 significantly impacts mispredictions, refining it is crucial.

   - **Incorporate New Rules:**
     - **Analyze Misclassifications:** Identify patterns among misclassified molecules not captured by current rules.
     - **Develop Additional Rules:** Introduce rules to cover these patterns and improve predictive accuracy.

   - **Iterative Testing and Refinement:**
     - **Continuous Improvement:** Test the updated rules, analyze performance, and refine iteratively.
     - **Domain Expertise:** Collaborate with chemists to ensure the rules align with chemical knowledge and experimental observations.

   - **Implement General Code Improvements:**
     - **Error Handling:** Ensure the code robustly handles exceptions during parsing and matching.
     - **Code Clarity:** Maintain clear, well-documented code for better maintainability and collaboration.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Yes, there is ample opportunity for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the rule definitions, implementing the specific suggestions provided, and validating the model using proper cross-validation techniques, we can enhance the model's predictive accuracy while ensuring it generalizes well to new data.

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*).
   - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity through effective chelation.

2. **Para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yields when the para-substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., amino, nitro, halomethyl); substituents like methyl, formyl, or thiol yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance metal-ligand interactions by increasing the electrophilicity of the aromatic ring, improving catalyst binding. Electron-donating groups or those that can interfere with metal coordination reduce effectiveness.

3. **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains yield high yields; those with single or distant hydroxyl groups yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]-2-oxoacetic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with metal centers due to increased coordination sites, improving catalyst effectiveness. Isolated hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination.

4. **Unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons yield high yields; introduction of polar functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) lowers the yield.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted aliphatic chains favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing activity. Polar substituents may interfere with these interactions or lead to undesired coordination, resulting in lower yields.

5. **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages yield low yields due to decreased coordination efficiency and increased conformational flexibility.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: The flexibility introduced by ether linkages can hinder optimal alignment of coordinating groups with metal centers, reducing the effectiveness of catalyst modification.

6. **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl chains yield low yields due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms to donate electron density to metal ions, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

7. **Modifiers with thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yields if aliphatic; if aromatic, they yield low yields due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or irreversibly, causing deactivation.

8. **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yields due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Reactive aldehyde groups may form adducts with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalytic sites.

9. **Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yields when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocycle; those with additional aromatic rings or linkers yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Direct attachment enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Additional linkers can disrupt optimal geometry.

10. **Amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms yield high yields; those without heteroatoms yield low yields.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
    - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
    - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity.

11. **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated yield low yields due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Acylation diminishes nucleophilicity of amino groups, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

12. **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings can yield high yields; however, the position and number of methoxy groups are important.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Optimal positioning is crucial for effective coordination.

13. **Modifiers with rigid aromatic systems containing additional carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high yields.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Rigid structures with multiple coordination sites enhance metal binding due to fixed geometry and proximity of functional groups.

14. **Modifiers with terminal amino groups on flexible aliphatic chains yield low yields due to ineffective coordination and potential interference with catalyst sites.**

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Flexible chains may not position amino groups optimally for coordination, and terminal amino groups may occupy active sites without contributing to catalysis.

15. **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yields due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and reducing catalyst activity.
